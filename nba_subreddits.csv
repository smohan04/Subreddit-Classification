3,3,I analyzed James Harden's performance in every NBA city to see if there is a correlation between his box score and the city's average strip club rating.,"Everyone knows James Harden has a particular affinity for the Canadian ballet, aka strip clubs. After the Rocket's dismal performance in Miami last week, and the city's reputation for high quality tit-shacks, I became increasingly curious to see just how much James Harden's vice affects his game.  So here we are, I spent the better part of the week on this, hope y'all enjoy!

**Hypothesis**: James Harden's box score declines in cities with high quality strip clubs

**Test**: Analyze James Harden's performance in every NBA city and correlate with those cities' reputation for strip clubs to see if there is any discernible relationship.

&#x200B;

**Methodology/Steps**:

* First I extracted all of James Harden's game logs for the past 4 seasons from Basketball Reference, cleaned up the data a bit (a bunch), and appended it into a single worksheet.
* Next, I filtered out all Home games and all games Harden was inactive or DNP. For the purpose of this analysis we did not look at home games.
* **Poor Performances** were determined by variances in 6 stats: Points, FG%, 3PT%, FT%, Assists and Turnovers. For each of these stats I compared Harden's *overall* season average to the *city-specific* season average. I identified 2 categories of poor performances:

1. Sub-Par - Harden performed WORSE than season average, and
2. Very Sub-Par - Harden performed 20%+ WORSE than season average.

* I analyzed his poor performances across each of the NBA’s 28 different cities (did not look at home games so no Houston, there are 2 teams in LA, and I distinguished between Brooklyn and NYC = 28 cities).
* **City Strip Club Rating** was determined by the average google review rating for the first 10 strip clubs in each city based on the google search “\[CITY\] Strip Clubs” (e.g., “Detroit Strip clubs”). Yes, this did involve me making like 30+ searches for strip clubs on my cpu...
* Finally, I put the City Strip Club Rating into the pivoted game log data, performed a regression analysis and visualized it into charts.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**:

>!I have proven, to a statistically significant degree, that James Harden’s game performance declines in cities with higher rated strip clubs. !<

>!Correlation Coefficient - r - (between avg strip club rating and total # of sub-par games) = .4575!<

* >!Given the nature of the subject matter, this would be considered a moderate-to-strong correlation. !<

>!Coefficient of Determination - r2 - (between avg strip club rating and total # of sub-par games) = .21!<

* >!This means that James Harden’s box score is 20% predictable based on the quality of a city’s strip clubs !<

>!Other interesting facts: !<

* >!Harden’s best performance comes in city with the worst strip clubs - Toronto!<
* >!Harden’s worst performance comes in city with the best strip clubs - Miami!<
* >!Salt Lake city has the 3rd-ranked strip clubs of all NBA cities lol!<

113,113,[OC] Charles Barkley's Secret: A Critical Analysis," If you have ever had the chance to watch a basketball game on TNT, you might have caught yourself as glued to the half-time show as the actual game. *NBA on TNT* is one of the best sports broadcasts hosted by some of the boldest personalities on TV: Shaquille O’Neil, Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, and of course… Charles Barkley. 

There are no subjects off limits and no quarter is given. But there is one topic that never fails to elicit strong consternation from Ernie despite roars of laughter from Shaq— Charles Barkley’s bit about the Big ol Women™ of San Antonio. If you haven’t seen it, here’s one of the best supercuts to catch you up: 

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7GPuudYY5k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7GPuudYY5k) 

As you can see, Chuck is fascinated with San Antonio — well, with the women and churros of San Antonio at least. He brings up the subject so often that simply googling “San Antonio Women” yields almost exclusively articles and clips of Barkley & Co. discussing the virtues of San Antonio churros, the Big ‘ol Women™ who eat them, and the city’s curious lack of Victoria’s Secret stores.

 

[ google search results for generic query \\""San Antonio Women\\""](https://preview.redd.it/81yphxq1mwg41.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=37f18954312ed009a9e3c4d2d6620d7e15a06900)

From his time as a [player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMzdAZ3TjCA), to his current career as a broadcaster, Barkley is infamous for never minding his tongue. When it comes to making Shaq and the production crew keel over with laughter, it’s clear he has no plans to change his humorous tone, no matter how much Ernie scorns him.  


***But did you ever wonder why… Why is Chuck so fixated on the Big ol Women*****™** ***of San Antonio and their unique pastry/ lingerie inclinations?***

  
***Is there something more behind the man’s obsession?***

So began my search to understand the enigma that is Charles Wade Barkley…

&#x200B;

# The Research

I started out by attempting to confirm or refute Barkley’s suspicions… 

* Does San Antonio have a lot of Big ol Women™? 
* Is Victoria really a “Secret” in San Antonio?, and
* How do fried Spanish pastries play into this whole thing?

Well let’s break it down one-by-one…

 

**San Antonio’s Big ol Women™**

I compared obesity rates for every NBA city to determine if there is any merit to Chuck’s claim that San Antonio has an abundance of plus-sized ladies…

[ NBA cities ranked by Obesity Rates ](https://preview.redd.it/9mm0ytabmwg41.png?width=383&format=png&auto=webp&s=6761f072a5ca61b9a1c7d47d1ae4bc3b9c64aee6)

As it turns out, he is right on point. According to my analysis of a 2018 CDC report, San Antonio is the 4th chunkiest city in the NBA with more than 37% of adults registering as “clinically obese”. And with over half of San Antonians identifying as female, it’s safe to say the city *does* have a lot of *Big ol Women™*.

Interesting side note: San Antonio isn’t just one of the fattest cities in the nation, they also have a distinct love for the rolls (pun intended). Per my research, San Antonio ranks #2 in the country for most google searches for “BBW”, which is of course the porn abbreviation for *Big Beautiful Women*. Not sure the significance of this fact, or how I came upon this information, but thought it was worth mentioning.

[google trend statistics for search term \\""bbw\\""](https://preview.redd.it/44t42v5dmwg41.png?width=466&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b9e965defdcc0bedd498dea3ee1369f16326141)

 *How many of these searches belong to Chuck himself? No small amount, I can assure you.*

 

**“Who’s Victoria?” — San Antonio**

Using [Victoria’s Secret store locator](https://www.victoriassecret.com/store-locator), I compiled the total number of store locations in each NBA city. Then, using 2016 U.S. Census Bureau statistics, I appended the populations for each city and calculated the amount of Victoria’s Secret stores per capita.

[ NBA cities ranked by Victoria's Secret stores per capita ](https://preview.redd.it/a8l2hdrgmwg41.png?width=658&format=png&auto=webp&s=97e81c43e0ac765ac3237f7df91ba0a1e2708772)

Again, Chuck’s intuition was spot-on! The city of San Antonio has the 4th fewest number of Victoria’s Secret stores per capita of all NBA cities (bottom 89th percentile).

I guess it’s safe to conclude, Victoria really is a secret in San Antonio.

*The author contacted Victoria’s Secret Public Relations prior to publishing this article but they chose not to comment on this story.*

 

**How do fried Spanish pastries play into this?**

Tremendously, that’s how.

I literally spent over three hours immersed in “churro data”. Admittedly, one of those hours was a lunchtime run to “Angel’s Churros & Chocolates” in Houston, TX — shout out to Maria for hooking it up with the Nutella on the side!

Using cutting-edge scientific research tools, I determined the number of churro vendors per capita in each NBA city. Okay, I googled that shit. I figured counting Mexican restaurants in general would be super misleading so I quantified specifically the number of churro vendors in each NBA city using the following criteria: Performed the google search “\[CITY\] Churros” (e.g., “San Antonio Churros”) and counted the amount of vendors with *explicit* references to “Churro” in the name. I accepted various spellings and puns (e.g., “xurros”, or “Churroholic”, etc).

[ NBA cities ranked by churro-vendors per capita ](https://preview.redd.it/9gjixg6kmwg41.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4fe6433feafdaa01a5a827a841ca236988cc978)

Well Mr. Barkley’s hunch was right again… San Antonio has the 4th most Churro-Vendors per capita in the NBA (top \~90th percentile). Have to admit, though, I did *not* expect to see Salt Lake City rank so high on this list. Considering the [strip club rankings](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dt0ucg/i_analyzed_james_hardens_performance_in_every_nba/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), I might actually have to make a trip to the ‘great white west’… 

&#x200B;

We have to give credit to Chuck here; he certainly knows his stuff! But for a man who [disavows data science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZf9NFaCQHQ), it begs the question, how does he know so much about the Alamo city?

&#x200B;

# The Analysis

With my suspicions on the rise, I dug deeper into the data. And the more I dug, the more it smelled… \*sniff\* and I love the smell of cinnamon and projection in the morning. So what is Mr. Barkley hiding? Well, I analyzed his career performance in San Antonio to see if there is more to the story.

Charles Barkley has an [impressive resume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley): two-time Olympic gold medalist, 11-time NBA All Star, 1993 Most Valuable Player, and an esteemed member of the NBA hall of fame. He went by the intimidating moniker, *Round Mound of Rebound*. He is, indubitably, one of the greatest ballers of all time. But, just like all the greats, he had a weakness…

&#x200B;

**‘The Biggest Loser’**

Between the years 1983–1998, Barkley played 19 games in San Antonio. *He won just 4 of them*. With his career road-win percentage at nearly .500, and considering the other damning stats laid out below, his .211 win rate in San Antonio falls soundly in the ""*curious""* column.

* Career Road W/L Record: 259–276 (.484 win%)
* San Antonio W/L Record: 4–15 (.211 win%)

 

[ W\/L split, Career Away vs in San Antonio ](https://preview.redd.it/hiw4wzawmwg41.png?width=696&format=png&auto=webp&s=49520e597148522c9414d67508b7de45bb8d8eac)

Now I don’t want to mislead you, San Antonio were no schmucks during this period and, obviously, basketball is a team sport. But Barkley carries most of the water: he was a generational talent and the stand-out star on most of his teams (aside from a couple years with a washed up Julius Erving and an aging Moses Malone in Philly and a couple with near-retirement Hakeem in Houston). But the following analysis should help further make my case.

&#x200B;

**‘My -25% Life’**

San Antonio proved to be a blight on Barkley’s esteemed career. My analysis showed significant declines in almost every statistical category examined:

* **GmSc** — Averaged a **-25% variance** in Game Score in SA compared to career avg
* **ORB** — Averaged a -**11% variance** in Offensive Rebounds in SA as compared to career avg
* **FT%** — Averaged a **-9% variance** in FT shooting efficiency in SA as compared to career avg
* **FG%** — Averaged a **-2% variance** in shooting efficiency in SA as compared to career avg
* **AST** — Averaged a **-6% variance** in Assists in SA as compared to career avg

Note: [GmSc](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/glossary.html) (Game Score) is a John Hollinger-created stat that gives a comprehensive measure of a player’s productivity. Formula: *GmSc=PTS+(0.4\*FG)–(0.7\*FGA)–\[0.4\*(FTA-FT)\]+(0.7\*ORB)+(0.3\*DRB)+STL+(0.7\*AST)+(0.7\*BLK)–(0.4\*PF)-TOV*

Here’s what the analysis looks like:

[ Barkley performance analysis via heat mapping ](https://preview.redd.it/bm4bja82nwg41.png?width=1127&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8908dd66fda7cb895c93a1f498644ed734988d1)

You can see the heat map to the left is covered in red. Red cells indicate *negative* variances, meaning: for that year, Barkley’s average in San Antonio was *below* his Season Average. Of the 112 total data points examined (8 stats x 14 seasons), Barkley under-performed against the season average **62%** of the time.

Heat maps are great but I needed to visualize the data in a way that better depicts the scale of Chuck’s drop in performance. I used a clustered column chart because it gives the best visual representation of relative performance, as you can easily identify the +/- trends (*Graphs for Dummies: larger/more frequent lines on BOTTOM = BAD; larger/more frequent lines on TOP = GOOD*).

These huge performance declines are damning. But what do they truly *tell us*?

&#x200B;

#  Conclusion

Well, if you’ve been following along, things should be starting to make sense. A picture has formed… how could a man who so ardently rebukes data science, know things about San Antonio that only the *data* can tell us?

Every Great had their weakness. MJ couldn’t stop gambling. Shaq couldn’t hit free throws. Magic couldn’t keep it in his pants. Kobe never saw a shot he didn’t like. LeBron, hairline.

For Charles Barkley, it was an entire city. The plus-sized women of San Antonio and their delectable Spanish pastries were the Round Mound’s kryptonite. And it appears he never got over it. A career of indulgence in the Alamo City has left him bitter with regret.

The Chuckster has used his platform on TNT to — not very credibly — disguise his own predilections for the amenities of San Antonio. Without stretching the facts too far, we can paint a vivid picture of Barkley’s own struggle. Imagine: a perpetual Big-and-Tall man since roughly the age of 12 (guessing) and a basketball phenom would have become accustomed to night-after-night by himself with nothing but his appetite and a sense that — thanks to his coaches — he *deserved* to be rewarded. That he was a *good boy*. Another city, another game, another 4-star hotel room to himself (another sold-out show, as it were).

The excitement of seeing San Antonio on the schedule brings tears to the man’s eyes. He knows what awaits him and purposefully forgets what happened before…

>*Barkley, awaken by the morning sun’s blistering reflection off the San Antonio R̶i̶v̶e̶r̶* [*Creek*](https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/San-Antonio-River-Authority-fires-back-at-Charles-5465978.php)*, sees the debris and refuse from an all-night binge. He did it again. Churro wrappers crinkling beneath his weight, cinnamon sugar coating the corners of his mouth and fingers alike, and a familiar wave of anxiety that tends to come after relapse. As his memory from the prior night returns, he glances around the room with a vain hopefulness that he did not ‘fall’ alone. He was relieved to learn that, in fact, he was not alone in the previous night’s debasement. Positioned heavily — nay, crushingly — on the duvet is a Big ol Woman™ sporting a handsome pair of* [*bloomers*](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Lolita-Women-Sweet-Bloomers-Underwear-Pumpkin-Shorts-Safety-Pants-Cosplay-/182538951060)*. Her voluminous mass reassuring him — no, beckoning him — to forgive himself for his indiscretions. It wasn’t just him after all. But he knew exactly what he had done. In a rush to forget, he licked the crusted cinnamon from his lips, quietly donned his game day attire and snuck out to meet his teammates in the lobby.*  
>  
>  
*But his mind would never leave that hotel room.*

It is through painting this portrait of a man both conflicted and passionate (aren’t we all) that we can better understand the system of associations that have led Barkley to betray his own naked psychology for all the world to jeer at. And yet, can we blame the man? Are we not all, on some level, looking for someone to share in our appetites? Whether it be for the occasional night of plus-size women and churros, or too many designer handbags; everyone has a vice. Unfortunately, from years of shame for letting down his teammates and coaches, Chuck has betrayed the very thing that he loves. 

That’s why I’m here to tell him, myself: **Stop Projecting, Mr. Barkley.**

**In 2020, the decade of proclaimed** **ass-eating, there is** ***no*** **shame. It’s** ***okay*** **to stan for Big ol Women™. In fact, it’s** ***great.***

[LeBron’s Quote (via Ben Golliver)](https://twitter.com/bengolliver/status/1291192892011294721?s=21)

I believe that the NBA isn’t worried about the people that will stop watching due to kneeling. It’s demographic isn’t quite like that of the NFL.

Anyone who is hanging on the words of Trump on whether to watch hoop or not probably isn’t all that interested in the basketball anyway.",nba

124,124,Wilt Chamberlain secretly dominated professional basketball at age 16 under a false identity. Scoring as much as 46 points against pros in the Eastern U.S. with a team record of 36-1. By age 17 he was averaging 40.5ppg. This is the first time I'm sharing this research:,"[Wilt Chamberlain Dominating Professional basketball leagues at age 16, and 17](http://imgur.com/vNZZsm5)

Calculated averages for 17 year old Wilt as a Quakertown Fay:

* 40.5ppg in 9 regular season games (according to one of the articles)

* 74ppg in 6 playoff games (according to the math... not sure it's even possible but who knows)

* 53.9ppg in 15 total games (according to a Quakertown book)

* Worth mentioning he won the MVP award in that league

[Image 4](http://i.imgur.com/BBnYsYc.jpg)

[Image 5](http://i.imgur.com/ecuUBnC.png)

Wilt Chamberlain, or as he was first known, ""George Marcus"", secretly dominated professional basketball under that assumed identity at age 16 for the Pittsburgh Raiders. Even as a kid against 6-11 men his own size playing professionally (such as former Harlem Globetrotters!) he averaged 53.9ppg by age 17. I found game recaps of multiple 46 point performances for the Quakertown Fay's at age 17, and at least one 44 point game even at age 16 for the Pittsburgh Raiders.

This is not only not often talked about, it's NEVER talked about. I've seen only a few references to his professional career that predated college basketball. When I researched this I found out it got him into potential trouble with the NCAA and so it was kept hushed and perhaps left to be forgotten.

*EDIT* Allow me to plug one other researcher who I've come to learn first shared the photographs of Wilt playing for the Fay's a few years ago. I found him on Twitter, and here's a link to a fascinating video he produced!

*EDIT*

IMPORTANT UPDATE - According to a Quakertown book (researched by [bardown](http://www.bardown.com/under-a-fake-identity-wilt-chamberlain-dominated-pro-basketball-when-he-was-16-and-17-1.757398) staff) Wilt actually averaged 53.9ppg in all 15 games as a Quakertown Fay! He ""only"" averaged 40.5ppg in 9 regular season games but with playoffs combined his 15 game average shoots up to 53.9ppg! This means 74ppg in the 6 playoff games as a Fay. I'm not sure if this is even possible so please take with a grain of salt. Though he did score 90 points in high school and 100 in the NBA including 5 other 70+ point games so who knows. This being against former pros his own size too including 6-11 former Globetrotter Andy Maddox!",nba

Context: Rachel asked Harden about Giannis' comment during the ASG selection when he picked Kemba over Harden because he wants someone who will actually pass. Harden replies that he averages more assists, but doesn't really pay mind to those comments.

Then he drops the not-so-subliminal bomb at Giannis saying he wishes he could just be 7 feet tall and run and dunk with no skill.  The cold war that has been simmering since last season between Harden and Giannis is officially a real thing now.

3. [Jordan Bell raked across the arm by Harden](https://streamable.com/s2n6m), no call. (pro tip: right click and select 1/4 speed to see the contact)

4. [Klay gets hand checked by Tucker and loses the ball](https://streamable.com/pqylu). No call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/j8f9c)

5. [KD gets pushed into Harden by Ryan Anderson](https://streamable.com/n27zm), foul on KD. Similar to [this play](https://streamable.com/nhcep), albeit less egregious by Anderson.

6. [Klay gets a point removed by Scott Foster](https://streamable.com/0nhtk).

A major theme which showed itself was the fact that Ryan Anderson literally (I'm not kidding) hand checked Curry every time he was switched onto him. And the Warriors forced that switch A LOT. Here's ALL the plays where Anderson guarded Curry:

The Clippers did the opposite of every single step and are now Title Contenders","[In 2017 Bill Simmons wrote this article about the Clippers and how to rebuild with them.](https://www.theringer.com/2017/6/30/16036456/2017-nba-free-agency-11-step-guide-to-fixing-los-angeles-clippers-steve-ballmer-lebron-5be49018c062)  I like Bill Simmons a lot, but I found it funny how every single step he recommended the Clippers did the opposite, and how that ended up with them being heavy title contenders.  Here is each step below:

1.  Let Blake Griffin leave (they re-signed him to a 5 year max deal).

2.  Trade DeAndre (they kept him until his contract expired)

3.  Trade Lou Williams (they kept and even re-signed him)

4.  Trade Patrick Beverly (they kept and even re-signed him)

5.  Fire Doc (kept him)

6.  Don't trade Austin Rivers (they traded him)

7.  Don't move to Inglewood (they are moving to Inglewood)

8.  Don't hire a GM (they hired one)

9.  Go after LeBron (I don't think they really even tried)

10.  Don't try and take over LA from the Lakers (they are trying)

11.  Move to Seattle (they obviously aren't)",nba

248,248,How my NBA experience turned into a nightmare thanks to StubHub - They denied my chance to see the final ever game at Sleep Train Arena last night by selling me invalid tickets.,"**4/11 - Here is an update since I don't think it is right to not give StubHub the positive publicity as well when they have reached out and offered to make it up to me.**
___________________________________

StubHub has reached out to me and advised me that, in keeping with their Buyer Guarantee of offering equal or better seats, they will get me tickets to the home opener next year.

The rep was extremely professional and apologetic for the situation. I told him they really should provide some kind of safeguards for buyers. He assured me that they aggressively go after any sellers who break their rules.
I'd have rather got in to the final game, but I am happy with the outcome.
__________________________________



**TL:DR – StubHub sold my wife and I invalid tickets to the final game ever at Sleep Train Arena (ARCO Arena) – they did not notify me the tickets were bad, I found out when we got denied by the scanner at the door.  Then they kept me on hold for over 40 minutes outside the venue.  I missed the game and it could happen to you.**
_______________

Let me preface this by saying I do not blame the Kings or NBA for this situation, however I do think that they need to be aware of what one of their major resellers is doing to their fans.

I am a Sacramento Kings fan - through thick and thin.  I scream about hating them, complain, and bemoan our lack of defense, lack of wins, lack of… everything.  We don’t have much.  We haven’t been to the playoffs in 10 years – the second longest drought in the NBA (behind the Wolves who I guarantee break that streak soon).  We have a superstar who teases us with his brilliance and then punishes us with his attitude and demeanor.  We went through an absolute nightmare of an ownership that tried not once, not twice, but three times to steal our team and take them to another city.  We just celebrated breaking thirty wins for the first time in nine years.  Yet I love the team to the core.

I’ve watched this team since I was a kid.  In the fourth grade, I had a Kings ruler with pictures of Danny Ainge, Wayman Tisdale, and Kenny Smith.  I had, and still have, only seen NBA games in a structure that has all of the sex appeal of a giant flat office building – Sleep Train Arena (it will always be ARCO to me).  

The entire basketball nation probably knows the plight of our dilapidated arena – tarps falling from the ceiling, leaks when it rains, toilets that don’t work.  Yet we Kings fans love the place.  We always have.  It’s the only real arena we have ever had – we don’t have any other major league sports in our city and this place is just cozy and fits us.  

It is the perfect arena for a bunch of rabid fans in a city that Phil Jackson infamously called a “cow town” – unwittingly unleashing the birth of the very loud Kings cowbells.

After all of the disasters of the previous ownership group, we finally were blessed by a man willing to save our team – Vivek Ranadive.  While we can argue his basketball knowledge and his hands on approach to basketball operations, we cannot argue that he saved the Sacramento Kings and ponied up a lot of money to build us a brand new arena in downtown Sacramento.

With that very arena scheduled to open this October, many of us Kings fans circled April 9, 2016 on our calendar; the final game at the “old barn” after 28 years.

I was one of those people.  I frequently purchase my tickets from a variety of sources – Kings.com, eBay, StubHub, Craigslist, etc.  Where ever the best deal lies.  Some are obviously more risky than others – Craigslist comes to mind.  

I would not fret about buying tickets from StubHub – I’ve done it before plenty of times.  I hear their commercials all of the time on the radio.  I had no reason to believe that there was any risk buying tickets from their website.

Unfortunately, I found out that I was completely wrong last night.
 
Yesterday, I bought tickets to the final game at Sleep Train with a scheduled tip off against the OKC Thunder at 7:30 pm.  I looked through StubHub and found a great dead for two tickets for my wife and I in Row H of the lower bowl.  The total price was $356.00 – expensive for a meaningless basketball game, but not for a once-in-a-lifetime event.  

The Kings were going to do it up big; tons of free giveaways, meet and greets with former players that spanned the entire Sacramento era, the opportunity to go out on the court and shoot a free throw and take pictures – it was going to be an amazing close to our shabby, but loved, arena.

I [purchased the tickets a little after 5:00 pm yesterday from StubHub](https://imgur.com/COW0Khe).  At 5:22 pm, I received my email confirmation with the tickets.  I immediately took [screenshots](http://imgur.com/22fIc9n) of [both tickets](https://imgur.com/gvpW9B0) to scan at the door on my phone.  My wife and I got ready and we were on our way to drive the 30 or so miles to the arena.

We arrived at approximately 7:00 pm and by this point could see all of the news trucks, concession stands, and hear the music playing.  We were getting excited.  The parking lot was as full as I’ve ever seen it.

We made our way past the security check point and walked up to the self-scanner at the door where I pulled up the screenshots of my tickets.  I scanned the first one at the turnstyle:  REFUND flashed on the screen.  I stood there for a second thinking maybe it didn’t register so I tried again.  REFUND.

At this point, people were piling up behind me so I stepped aside feeling a little embarrassed – like I was some scammer or didn’t know how to use the scanner.  This was where I felt my first pang of panic.  

I pulled up the second ticket and slid back in line to try again.  REFUND.  I flagged down a door attendant who tried his hand scanner on both tickets: REFUND, REFUND.  It was 7:05 pm and I was in full on panic mode now.  

The door attendant advised me to go to the box office so we tore off in that direction. I desperately did not want to miss the last ever player introductions at this arena.  Inside the box office, I was sympathetically told by the attendant, “I’m so sorry, this is a StubHub problem and we can’t help you – you need to call them but they’re very good at refunds.”

REFUND.  There’s that word again.  

I don’t want a refund – I want to see this game!  And time is tick, tick, ticking away.  I grab my phone and literally type StubHub into google as fast as my fingers will let me.  I find the number and call.  After the automated message, the voice tells me the first thing I was dreading to hear, “all of our representatives are assisting other callers – we will be with you shortly.”

I am basically beside myself by now – I am down to about 15 minutes to tip off and I have no way through the door.  At 7:25pm, while still on hold, I got desperate and went back to the box office.  I asked the representative what the cheapest tickets were just to get in the building.  He tells me $160.00 each for nosebleed upper bowl tickets – plus fees.  

I can’t believe what I am hearing.  I still don’t know the status of my StubHub tickets so now I am faced with the choice of buying these tickets in front of me for more than the lower bowl tickets that I should already have in my possession or continuing to wait on hold.

I don’t know if I am getting a refund or not for the StubHub tickets, since no one will answer the phone, and am afraid of buying four tickets.  The box office rep says to me, “man, I’m so sorry – we’ve been seeing this all night from StubHub.”

7:25 pm, 7:30 pm, 7:40 pm, 7:45 pm

By 7:45 pm, I came to the realization that I was not going to see this game.  My wife and I started the most depressing, dejected walk back to our car imaginable.  About halfway there, the StubHub rep finally came on the line – after 40+ minutes on hold.  I calmly (as possible) explained my situation to him and asked him exactly what had happened.

He was unable to explain why my tickets would not work.  I asked him point blank, “Did the guy who sold me these tickets also sell them to someone else.”  He would not answer, just saying that sometimes there are issues with the tickets.  I kept pressing him, asking him why I was not notified that my tickets would not work before I got to the door.  At least then I would have had an opportunity to get different ones.  [The only email I received at that point was my confirmation](https://imgur.com/si3xBbk).  He told me that they do not monitor the transactions so if there is an issue, you will not know until you get denied at the door.

I couldn’t believe that I was not getting an answer as to why my tickets would not work.  I explained to him that this was not just any game – this is a one-time event.  I could tell that he was starting to understand the gravity of my situation.  I kept pushing him about the seller and how this happened.  That’s when he dropped the bomb on me.

He said, and I quote, **“I probably shouldn’t tell you this, but the seller you bought these tickets from is already under investigation for selling bad tickets.”**

So there it is – StubHub knew that this guy is selling bad tickets on their site.  Or at the very least, he is selling the same tickets to multiple people.  The rep told me that he would be investigated which mean absolutely nothing to me standing in the parking lot.  

He told me he would issue a refund for the price of the tickets and offered me 20% off of my next purchase.  It wasn’t then, and it’s not now, about the money.  We missed something that we had our heart set on.

We went to a nearby restaurant and watched the game on TV which honestly felt more painful.  It was basically everything we knew it would be; a great halftime show featuring the past players, sentimental videos, the roar of the sell-out crowd as the game came down to the final shot – with the Kings winning it with 1 second on the clock.  But it wasn’t about the game on the court, it was about the atmosphere in the building.  And we missed it.

The final kick in the teeth came on the drive home as I listened to the post-game on AM radio.  During a commercial break there was a StubHub ad talking about their “guarantee” to get you in the game.  I couldn’t believe it.  

As soon as I got home, I fired off an email to StubHub explaining what happened [PART 1](https://imgur.com/CsPS7id) and [PART 2](https://imgur.com/xhxoupa).  This morning, [I got the response which was basically a form letter](https://imgur.com/05E42wK) with some things changed in it.  They ask me to call them back so that they can further investigate.  I called them and the rep I spoke to had no idea why I was calling in, saying, “oh they already are looking into the seller.  They probably just wanted you to call to verify you received your refund.”  I knew I got my refund last night!  

I asked him if he at least saw the 20% discount on my account for my next purchase and he said, “No I don’t see it but I will make sure I add it right now.  It’s actually a 20% credit based on the purchase price of the tickets you already bought.”  At this point, whatever.  So he tells me based on the price of $356.00, my credit on my account will be $71.20.  Not nearly what I think I should get for what I missed but I know I’m not going to get anywhere with this guy.  He thanks me for using StubHub (!) and the call ends.

A couple of minutes later, [an email comes through showing the credit issued to my account](https://imgur.com/Wjryil1).  $17.80.  Only missed the mark by $53.   At this point, I am at a loss for words.  

I have sent off yet another email re-explaining everything and asking the questions:

* Why does the seller retain control over tickets that he sold and [received money for](https://imgur.com/AlpkvTh)?

* Why does StubHub not warn it’s buyers that you will not make it in to your event if the seller chooses to take his tickets back and resell them to someone else?

* Why was I never advised before I made it to the gate that I was not going to get in?  Had I been advised with enough time, I could have received my refund and still bought other tickets.  By the time I found out I wasn’t getting in and then waited on hold for 40 minutes, I missed my chance to get in.

- Why was the offer of equal or better seats never given to me at the time?  I would have been mad at missing the first quarter, but at least I would have seen the final three quarters.

* Why is there not some sort of seller feedback system to warn buyers of fraudulent sellers similar to eBay?  By their own representative’s admission, this seller was known to StubHub to be a potentially fraudulent seller.  Had I known this guy had issues, I obviously would have avoided the listing.

Here is StubHub’s guarantee [straight from their website](http://www.stubhub.com/fanprotect-update/):

**Summary of StubHub guarantee to Buyers:**

* *You will get your tickets in time for the event*

* *Your tickets will be valid for entry*

* *Your tickets will be the same as those you ordered*

*If any of these things do not occur and you comply with applicable policies and timelines, we will find you comparable or better tickets to the event, or offer you a refund or FanCode for future purchase*


I was never, at any point last night, offered comparable or better tickets.  Even though at that point, I would have been mad as I had already missed the first quarter.


I apologize for the exceptionally long post.  I want to warn people about StubHub and tell everyone that this company is no better than buying from some stranger on Craigslist.  I hope this gains some traction so that no one else has to go through something as bad as this.",nba

Toronto's Childrens Hospital is Sick Kids Hospital - https://www.sickkids.ca/

I've cross posted this to both /r/torontoraptors and /r/lakers as well to get more eyes on it.

FINAL EDIT: 

So this is a turn of events. Clippers got him. I honestly thought they weren't really in the running anymore and it was a toss up between Lakers and Raptors. As I've said in comments I never meant any disrespect to Clippers fans and congrats to them! When they were brought up I really didn't know how to do a 3 way deal between 2 cities. Now that here here though...

The spirit of the wager was the winning team donates to the other teams kids hospital. Clippes fans have wanted to be in this so much I'm hoping now they step up. I'd suggest donating to either city's kids hospital. You want to keep your donation local give to CHLA, want to show Toronto some love give to Sick Kids in Toronto. for Lakes and Raptors fans I'm suggesting they each give to the other charity. As a Raptors fan I'm still going to give to CHLA. There is no reason not to in my mind.

I'm glad my post could bring people together in a positive way and I know some good has come out of it.

290,290,People don't talk enough about how awful the Hornets are,"* One of only 6 teams in the NBA/NFL/MLB/NHL that's never even made a conference finals. They're the second oldest of those 6 teams behind the Clippers.

* They've only drafted 4 All-Stars that went on to play for them despite being around since 1988: Alonzo Mourning, Larry Johnson, Baron Davis, and Kemba Walker. And they've had the most chances to draft All-Stars too: the Hornets rank #1 with the lowest average draft spot in that time.

* Then-coach Steve Clifford wanted the Hornets to draft Donovan Mitchell in 2017, but Rich Cho overruled him and drafted Malik Monk instead.

* The Hornets were seriously looking to draft Pascal Siakam in 2016, but decided to trade their pick for Marco Belinelli who spent one year with the team before being traded to Atlanta in the Dwight Howard trade.

* The Hornets were offered three first-round picks by the Celtics for the #9 pick in 2015. Michael Jordan turned the offer down to pick Frank Kaminsky. Kaminsky was always in the coach's doghouse here, his family hated Charlotte, and Kaminsky signed with Phoenix this offseason.

* After having the worst record in NBA history in 2012, the Bobcats lost out on the #1 pick which was going to be Anthony Davis. They then selected Michael Kidd-Gilchrist with the #2 pick instead of Bradley Beal. In the same draft, they selected Jeffery Taylor with their 2nd round pick, just ahead of Draymond Green and Khris Middleton.

* They did select Kemba Walker in 2011, but they also gave Stephen Jackson, Shaun Livingston, and the pick that would turn into Tobias Harris so they could jump up and draft Bismack Biyombo. They selected Biyombo instead of the player that had been mocked to them in several mock drafts: Kawhi Leonard. They also had Klay Thompson on the board.

* The second best draft pick they've had since their 2004 rebirth has been Emeka Okafor.

* They haven't won a playoff series since April 2002 when LeBron was in high school, Zion was 1 year old, The Scorpion King was #1 at the box office, Ashanti had the #1 song in America, and Hollywood Hogan was WWE Champion. The closest they've come to winning a series since then was the Purple Shirt Guy game when they were up 3-2 vs. the Heat and had cut a 9 point Heat lead to 2 with 1:30 left. A Hornets fan known as Purple Shirt Guy started inexplicably jawing with Dwyane Wade who proceeded to drop a quick 5 points to tie the series up. The Hornets would go on to lose Game 7 in Miami by 27 points.

* Despite letting their best player ever walk for nothing, they're hard-capped at the moment. They'll be hard-capped this season with a starting 5 of Terry Rozier, Cody Zeller, Nic Batum, Dwayne Bacon, and Miles Bridges. Bismack Biyombo will be making $17 million off the bench, Marvin Williams will be making $15 million off the bench, and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist will be making $13 million off the bench. Nic Batum (who has turned into a completely worthless player) will be entering the 4th year of a 5 year deal (final year a player option) that will pay him $25.5 million. He'll almost certainly use that player option in 2020 and will be making $27.1 million.

* The Hornets hired a new radio play-by-play guy before the start of the 2018-19 season that grew up a Hornets fan and was a beloved radio host in Charlotte. He was fired in the middle of a week in March with no explanation and no explanation has come out since.

* Michael Jordan hasn't given an interview where he's discussed the Hornets in any detail (besides Kemba Walker) since 2014.

So as you bitch and complain about how your team hasn't done anything in a long time or how you only have one All-Star and you're disappointed you didn't get another, remember that things could always be worse.",nba

296,296,Rachel Nichols and the ESPN crew were extremely disrespectful last night,"I’m not sure if this has been posted by someone already, but I just wanted to say that the things they let Rachel Nichols and Woj say during the draft lottery were blatantly disrespectful to all of the teams, save for maybe the Knicks, to all of the other draft picks, and to the Pelicans. Not to mention the fact that everything they were saying was being blasted throughout the entire venue. 

First off, there were over a dozen teams in attendance last night. The only one that they chose to talk about: the Knicks. They talked unbelievably liberally about Zion going to NY, as if they had already won it. However, as I doubt any of them realized, the Knicks had the same chance of obtaining the #1 pick as the Cavs and the Suns, the latter of which I don’t even think was mentioned once on the broadcast.

Then, there was Zion. Rachel Nichols kept referring to the #1 pick as “who gets Zion.” Every time she said that or mentioned the kid, the camera would cut to the embarrassed 18 y/o who was just there to see what team picks where. There is no guarantee that Zion will go #1 overall. It is very very likely, but not guaranteed. Not to mention that they did this in front of a large number of draft prospects in attendance. What does all of this coverage and press mean to them if it’s only going to Zion?

And finally, the Pelicans. Woj made every team’s case for a possible AD trade that night. Whenever a team with chances of getting a top 10 pick was mentioned, Woj had to slip in that they may be looking to use that pick as an “asset” to trade for AD. I’m honestly very happy the Pelicans won because the disrespect they were receiving the whole night was greatly trumped when they won the first pick.

Now I get all of these things are said ten times over on any other sports news broadcast. However, as I said, Rachel Nichols audio was blasted for everyone at the event to hear, including the draft prospects and team representatives. After watching this, I asked my dad if there was ever a time where the media would be able to speak this liberally about sports in front of all of those people. He said “no.”

311,311,Why LeBron would sign with every NBA team,"**Atlanta Hawks**

LeBron is secretly a huge Twister fan. He will join the Hawks so he can film Twister 2 with their owner’s wife on their off days.

**Boston Celtics**

LeBron misses Kyrie. He wants to play basketball with his friend and that means playing for the Celtics.

OR

LeBron wants to troll Kyrie. He will go to Boston management and ask them to trade Kyrie back to Cleveland if they want him to join. Danny Ainge will agree because he has no heart.

**Brooklyn Nets**

LeBron loves NY. He will go to New York to sign with the Knicks to play in historic Madison Square Garden. However, during the drive to the stadium, his driver makes a wrong turn and they end up in Brooklyn. LeBron realizes the mistake, but shrugs his shoulders and signs with the Nets instead, because he will have the same results with either the Knicks or Nets.


**Charlotte Hornets**

LeBron wants to prove he’s better than Michael Jordan. He will sign with the Hornets to taunt MJ directly. He will win the Finals in 2019 with the Hornets and won’t let MJ touch the trophy. After the season, LeBron will buy out MJ’s shares and he will become majority owner. He will then trade himself to a better team because Dwight is too annoying and nobody will agree to LeBron’s trade proposals involving Dwight.

**Chicago Bulls**

LeBron wants to prove he’s better than Michael Jordan. He will sign with the Bulls so he can win 7 championships to pass what MJ did.


**Cleveland Cavaliers**

LeBron loves Cleveland as much as he hates moving. LeBron will re-sign with the Cavs, because it’s more convenient than moving to a different city.

**Dallas Mavericks**

LeBron is still haunted by the 2011 Finals. He will go to Dallas to learn from the true GOAT Dirk Nowitzki. There, LeBron will lead the Mavs all the way to the number 1 seed in the West, only to lose to the Warriors in the first round after KD leaves for India to re-join his snek charmer friend.

**Denver Nuggets**

LeBron loves chicken nuggets. He will sign with Denver, only to be disappointed. He then will retire and start his own chicken nugget company.

**Detroit Pistons**

LeBron will become the new Pistons President of Basketball Operations. His first act in his new role will be to sign himself as the head coach/starting SF. His second transaction will be to trade Blake Griffin to the Cavs for the 8th pick in the draft and salary filler, because LeBron will blackmail Dan Gilbert into doing it.

**Golden State Warriors**

LeBron wants all the ringz. He will sign with the Warriors for the veteran minimum so he can win not 1, not 2, not 3, not 4, not 5, not 6, not 7, not 8, not 9, but 10 championships.

**Houston Rockets**

LeBron loves space. He will sign with the Rockets so he can go to NASA and fly an actual rocket into space to find better competition on other planets. Mike Dan Tony will be confused why LeBron doesn’t show up to their games. Mike, he’s in space, deal with it.

**Indiana Pacers**

LeBron loves pace. He will sign with the Pacers so he can out-pace the other NBA players and win a championship. He will also become best friends with Lance Stephenson and the two will call out plays to each other by blowing in each other’s rear, I mean ear.

**LA Clippers**

LeBron wants to live in Hollywood, but doesn’t want to be under the shadow of Laker greats. If he can just lead the Clippers to the conference finals, they would rename their franchise LeBron’s Clippers.

**LA Lakers**

LeBron wants to live in Hollywood, but doesn’t want to be under the shadow of Clipper goods. He also wants to learn from the great Lavar Ball on how to play basketball as good as him.

**Memphis Grizzlies**

LeBron will not sign with the Memphis Grizzlies.

**Miami Heat**

LeBron will go back to Miami because he left his white headband there and wants it back.

**Milwaukee Bucks**

LeBron loves freaks. He will join the Greek Freak and sign with the Bucks. Then they will sign Rick James to preform every halftime so he can sing LeBron’s favorite song “Super Freak”

**Minnesota Timberwolves**

LeBron wants to learn from former MVP Derrick Rose. He also wants to torture his body and allow Coach Thibs to play him all 48 minutes for all 82 games.

**New Orleans Pelicans**

LeBron loves smoothies. He will join the Brow and sign with the Pelicans, so he can get unlimited smoothies at the Smoothie King Center.

**New York Knicks**

LeBron loves NY. He will go to New York to sign with the Knicks to play in historic Madison Square Garden. During the drive to the stadium, his driver makes the correct turn and they end up in MSG. LeBron realizes this and signs with the Knicks.

**OKC Thunder**

LeBron will sign with the Thunder so he can play with Russell Westbrook for one season, then leave after that and become an even better player.

**Orlando Magic**

LeBron will take his talents to Central Florida. He will sign with the Magic and lead them to another Finals lost.

**Philadelphia 76ers**

LeBron will sign with the 76ers because he trusts the process. LeBron will single handedly play bad for 3 seasons and tank so that the 76ers will get more draft picks to add to their squad. Then by age 37, LeBron will have what he needs to win another Eastern Conference Finals.

**Phoenix Suns**

LeBron loves hot-related teams. He will sign with the Suns and win 2 championships to prove to Pat Riley that he isn’t so special with his so called “Heat” for the “Suns” are the hottest thing in the universe.

**Portland Trail Blazers**

LeBron loves Nike. He will sign with the Blazers so that he can spend his off days at Nike headquarters creating new shoes.

**Sacramento Kings**

LeBron is the King. He will sign with the Kings, because that’s where he belongs.

**San Antonio Spurs**

LeBron loves Coach Pop. He will sign with the Spurs to learn from him, only to find out Coach Pop actually has no idea what he’s doing and is just really lucky. LeBron will use that luck to convince Kawhy? To stay and they will win a championship every other year in 2019, 2021, and 2023.

**Toronto Raptors**

LeBron will sign with the Raptors just to check up on them and make sure they are ok.

**Utah Jazz**

LeBron loves jazz. He will sign with Utah only to find out they don’t actually have jazz. He will then force a trade to New Orleans to be close to real jazz and because he remembered that he loves smoothies.

**Washington Wizards**

LeBron loves politics. He will sign with the Wizards so he can play basketball and also become the next president of the United States in 2020.

Because DeSean’s post was a quote attributed to Hitler, it cannot be debated that it wasn’t anti-Semitic and thus I don’t see any possible errors with the title. PLEASE leave this up for discussion. We need some kind of discourse.

I’m amazed and shocked by this. For those who don’t know, [DeSean Jackson posted a quote from Hitler](https://imgur.com/gallery/gSb7eyd) (edit- now said to be Farrakhan but written as Hitler) last night on his Instagram. Stephen Jackson replied with [this video today](https://streamable.com/yk2vur) about the whole situation, saying Jackson was “speaking the truth” and trying to get educated. The comments of the post also encourage the same “Jews control everything” hate that have fueled terrors of the past, with [Stephen Jackson even replying to one of them.](https://imgur.com/a/7YFggCE?fbclid=IwAR325lH10U5judJVIOxr3o3Ay-OUV6k7muLRgMCYMTzQxkoNVZPS58Cy-uI)

I’m extremely disappointed by Stephen Jackson (who has been a face of BLM) as well as this not getting traction in the media yet and even getting removed here. We say we are anti-hate but we can’t have double standards when we do so.

**EDIT-** Stephen Jackson deleted the video and has posted [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCXdZpzlVEf/), basically doubling down on his comments with a follow-up just as infuriating as the first post. He has seen a bit of backlash on IG (and some praise) but this should really be a bigger story given his platform and following. **How is it getting almost no traction in the NBA world?** The majority of the responses to this thread here have been really encouraging to see, and to the people commenting “Well, Jews do run everything”… I urge you to read about how dangerous this notion has been in history, particularly in the context of the Holocaust.

315,315,I sold Josh Hart a Switch in 2017. And he still owes me. (Repost from /Lakers),"#UPDATE: http://imgur.com/gallery/c8btRei

Justice is served! Josh reach out and sent me this.
Thank you everyone for you help and turning this into a success story!!!!!

Back in the summer of 2017, we drafted Josh Hart out of Villanova with the 30th pick. I loved the pick cause I knew the kid was a baller and gave us some nice depth.
He made a tweet that summer while he was in Vegas getting ready for the summer league, about wanting to buy a Nintendo Switch. My little brother jokingly replied to him without expecting a response, but to our surprise, he did.
The conversation went as follows:

 http://imgur.com/gallery/WkSFMJm

We agreed on 200 dollars, tickets to a future game and the chance to meet with him for a Switch and Zelda Breath of the Wild. I shipped it to him overnight. As a life long Laker fan (I have a tattoo so I'm not playing around) I was ecstatic at having some kind of connection to a Laker, let alone one I genuinely liked.

He did PayPal me the 200 right when he got it, and he did reach out to me about what tickets I wanted. I asked him for the December 18th game...which was Kobe Bryant's jersey retirement. I knew the odds of getting those tickets were slim, but of course I'm going to shoot my shot at that game.

That was the last I heard from him. I have reached out to him through my personal Twitter, and my brother has attempted to as well. He reads the message, but never replies. I have joined his Twitch live streams and tried to get his attention there too, and he seems to ignore me there too.

I have no ill will towards the man, I just want what we had agreed upon and not be ghosted. I feel waiting 2 seasons and still no tickets is pretty absurd at this point, and the lack of communication is the real ball buster.

So please Josh....just pay up bro.

“My girls and I want to thank the millions of people who’ve shown support and love during this horrific time. Thank you for all the prayers. We definitely need them. We are completely devastated by the sudden loss of my adoring husband, Kobe — the amazing father of our children; and my beautiful, sweet Gianna — a loving, thoughtful, and wonderful daughter, and amazing sister to Natalia, Bianka, and Capri. We are also devastated for the families who lost their loved ones on Sunday, and we share in their grief intimately. There aren’t enough words to describe our pain right now. I take comfort in knowing that Kobe and Gigi both knew that they were so deeply loved. We were so incredibly blessed to have them in our lives. I wish they were here with us forever. They were our beautiful blessings taken from us too soon. I’m not sure what our lives hold beyond today, and it’s impossible to imagine life without them. But we wake up each day, trying to keep pushing because Kobe, and our baby girl, Gigi, are shining on us to light the way. Our love for them is endless — and that’s to say, immeasurable. I just wish I could hug them, kiss them and bless them. Have them here with us, forever. Thank you for sharing your joy, your grief and your support with us. We ask that you grant us the respect and privacy we will need to navigate this new reality. To honor our Team Mamba family, the Mamba Sports Foundation has set up the MambaOnThree Fund to help support the other families affected by this tragedy. To donate, please go to MambaOnThree.org. To further Kobe and Gianna’s legacy in youth sports, please visit MambaSportsFoundation.org.

325,325,Antetokoumpo accidentally whips a ball at Harden then Ilyasova drains a triple - ESPN,,nba
326,326,The Outrage of NBA Fans is Disproportionate.,"I'd like to preface this by stating that what GSW part-owner Mark Stevens did in game 3 was unacceptable. He pushed Kyle Lowry and deserves to be fined and suspended from attending games.

&nbsp;

However, it is my opinion that the outcry has been wildly disproportionate to other acts of violence in the NBA.

&nbsp;

I realise that it was less about the fact that the 60 year old Silicon Valley venture capitalist might've hurt Lowry with his left handed push and was more just the fact that he laid his hands on a player in an unfriendly way. 

&nbsp;

The public outcry has been intense. People are calling for a lifetime ban and demanding that he be forced to sell his shares in the team. The incident is already written on his Wikipedia page.

&nbsp;

People are out for blood with Kyle Lowry leading the charge.

&nbsp;

>""A guy like that, showing his true class, and he shouldn't be a part of our league. There's just no place for that.""

&nbsp;

>""The support I've gotten from fellow players, the league, has been unbelievable. With that being said, I think more should be done.""

&nbsp;

>""I have 2 young children and being able to hold myself to a certain standard. Which I do. I hold myself to a high, high standard.""

&nbsp;

These are all quotes from Kyle Lowry. The same Kyle Lowry who in 2012 pled guilty to the battery of a female referee at a charity basketball game. 

&nbsp;

This was one of his quotes on that day:

&nbsp;

>""B****, meet me outside. I will kick your a**!""

&nbsp;

He then proceeded to throw a basketball at her for a second time, as hard as he could. He (potentially) received a fine of up to $1,000 and was suspended for 0 games. 500 times less than Mark Stevens got for his push. The fine was from a judge in a courtroom and not even from the league. The league did nothing. There is no mention of this on Lowry's wikipedia page. 

&nbsp;

If Lowry thinks $500,000 and a year ban is soft for Mark Stevens then I wonder what he thought about his $0, 0 game punishment for battery of a woman in 2012?

&nbsp;

In August of 2010, beloved NBA clown Lance Stephenson pushed his pregnant girlfriend down a staircase and then proceeded to bash her head against the stairs. 

&nbsp;

Two years prior to this he sexually assaulted a 17 year old girl at his high school.

&nbsp;

He went on to play over 500 NBA games and earn over $35 million dollars. 

&nbsp;

At the time of the staircase attack, he hadn't played a single NBA game. 9 years later, he's still in the league. 

&nbsp;

I was a fan of Lance but only because I'd never heard this mentioned in a single one of his games. I even paid actual money to buy his Charlotte Hornets jersey. I wore his name and number on my back. Call me old fashioned, but I think that the second you bash your pregnant girlfriend's head against some stairs, you should forfeit the privilege of playing NBA basketball.

&nbsp;

OJ Mayo and Tyreke Evans were both given 2 year bans for violating the NBA anti-drug program. The NBA is prohibited from disclosing what type of drugs they were found to have taken but reports suggest the violations were related to ""drugs of abuse"" which implies they were recreational and not performance enhancing.

&nbsp;

Jason Kidd was fined $200 (by a judge) for abusing his wife. He was suspended for 0 games.

&nbsp;

Darren Collison, Jason Kidd, Jason Richardson. The NBA has a history of letting abusers off lightly. All just because they're good at basketball.

&nbsp;

I'm a firm believer in forgiveness and giving people second chances but if Kyle Lowry and NBA fans think Mark Stevens should be banned for life then Kyle Lowry should've never become a Raptor, Jason Kidd should not be the league's highest paid assistant coach and Lance Stephenson should've never played a minute in the NBA.

Look bitch, I'm gonna cut it straight.  I don't have a fancy pitch like the rest of these teams.  I'm just gonna be real.  We're desperate dude. The troops are low on morale and I don't think they'll survive another winter like this.  I know we don't have much, but I'm gonna try to at least show you what we have.  Any help will do.  We'll even take Bronny Jr.  Right now.

1. **We've got young meat who will do literally whatever you say.** -  We've got a lot of talent, and absolutely no ego whatsoever. We're the South Central Louisiana State Mud Dogs of the NBA. You can make the rest of the team wash your feet between quarters and they'd do it.  This will be a drama free zone.  You're the king and they are your squires.  But like, please don't abuse this power and sell anyone into human trafficking rings or anything.  I know Evan's got a pretty mouth but don't okay

2.  **Orlando is a trash city just like Cleveland** - Look, you're an Ohio boy through and through.  You'd hate Los Angeles.  Buncha liberal hippies with their ""activated charcoal"" and their ""functioning state government"" and all that other PC nonsense.  You dont need that in your life.  Plus those taxes are you kidding me?  Nobody in Florida pays taxes.  If you can prove to the state that you're physically capable of tackling a gator, you don't have to pay state taxes.

3. **We're about as physically far away from Golden State as you can get.**
 
4. **...""But what about Miami?""** - Miami can eat my ass.  You've already been there Bron.  They're gonna expect 2010 Bron and when father time eventually catches up with you in 2050 they're gonna riot and start calling you names in spanish.  You don't want that kinda stress in your life.  Anybody who would call you names in spanish lives far away in Kissimmee.  We will protect you.

5. **The kids love Disney** - You're a family man now Bron.  Think about the kids.  I mean who wouldn't love all year access to Disney World?  Who doesn't love 10 dollar bottles of water and roaving hoardes of Brazilian teens yelling at birds and stuff?  It's great for the whole family.

398,398,Carmelo Anthony was never a top 5 player. Not even once.,"I was in the ""538 Hates Melo"" thread, about to reply to someone arguing ""Melo actually used to be top 5,"" then I decided, fuck it. I've *always* hated melo's game. 

What follows is me trying to illustrate that not only was Melo not a top 5 player *of his era*, he was never a top 5 player at all.  Not even fucking once. I'm doing this for me.

### Melo, at a glance
* only twice made it out of the first round
* 215th all-time in ws/48, tied with Corey Maggette
* not in top 250 for career TS%
* not in top 250 for career Offensive Rating
* made up for this relative inefficiency by not passing much or trying on defense
* [tried to combat questions about work ethic by posting video of himself jogging](https://www.instagram.com/p/BWCHXsYDoXx/?utm_source=ig_embed)
* [this entire article](http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/11904296/new-york-knicks-forward-carmelo-anthony-wants-bulletproof-reputation)

#### The Most Overated Player of his Era

Anthony has made 10 all-star games, and was often cited  as a top 5 player.

Carmelo's net offensive and defensive rating are the exactly the same (108). That means he's giving up a lot of what he gives you. And 108, as mentioned above, isn't anything special.  [Here is the full list of players who have made at least 3 all-star games with Carmelo's defensive rating or worse, capped at Melo's offensive rating.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&match=combined&type=totals&per_minute_base=36&per_poss_base=100&season_start=1&season_end=-1&lg_id=NBA&age_min=0&age_max=99&is_playoffs=N&height_min=0&height_max=99&birth_country_is=Y&as_comp=gt&as_val=3&pos_is_g=Y&pos_is_gf=Y&pos_is_f=Y&pos_is_fg=Y&pos_is_fc=Y&pos_is_c=Y&pos_is_cf=Y&c1stat=def_rtg&c1comp=gt&c1val=108&c2stat=off_rtg&c2comp=lt&c2val=108&order_by=ws)

###Melo in Denver 
""Melo was actually good in denver!"" Sure!  ""Melo was a top 5 player in denver!"" [No.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DCJXYbBB7w) While more dynamic than his plodding, interminably jab-stepping, Knicks iteration, he was never actually a top 5 player. He only made it out of the first round once.
 
####First: Melo has never been better than LeBron. 
Lebron was born on December 30th, 1984. He was immediately better than Carmelo. Every second since that moment, LeBron has been increasing the distance between them. They came into the league at the same moment: one committed to perpetual improvement, the other, Carmelo Anthony. Twin spaceships traveling at different velocities. To calculate the distance between them now, you'd have to figure out some way to make Melo's spaceship actually start going in reverse and then explode. I'm too dumb to figure that out, so we're moving on.

####Second: Denver Melo was  *never* better than Kobe or Dirk
From 2005-2012, there wasnt a single season he was better than Kobe or Dirk. Melo *never* finishes above these guys in all-nba over this period. Not once. More importantly, with the benefit of retrospect, we can see these two (along with LeBron) were great every season, always healthy, and whenever they had *any* talent around them, contended for titles/MVPs. They got everything out of their team, year after year. There's not a single season you wouldn't trade Melo for one of these three and improve Denver.  (To preemptively shut down the idea Melo was better than Dirk in 2009, when he beat the Mavs in the second round: Dirk averaged 34/12/4 on 53/38/92 shooting in that series--if you put Dirk on that Nuggets team, they would've been even better. Dirk was also 1st team All-Nba to Melo's 3rd. Melo also didn't even make the all-star team.)

So: Melo is at best, the 4th best player any season from 2005-2012. I now just have to establish that there were at least *2* other guys who were better each season during that period, and I can knock Denver Melo out of the top 5 rankings.

#### Numbers 4, 5, 6 
Here i'm going to list three players (in any order), that I think were conclusively better than Melo in each corresponding season. Why three, when I only need two? Because fuck Melo. Honestly, in a lot of these seasons I could list ~10+ players. Finally, just because someone like Nash or Duncan drops out doesnt necessarily mean I think they're no longer better than Melo--they probably are--it's just that there are 3 more inarguable players. 

##### 2005-2011
2005 | 2006 | 2007| 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2011

Nash | Nash | Nash | Dwight | Dwight | Dwight | Rose
Duncan | Duncan | Duncan | CP3 | CP3 | Durant | Durant
Shaq | Wade | Wade | Garnett | Wade | Wade | Wade



### Melo in New York
Unlike his team USA compatriots, Melo was uninterested in forming a superteam, instead taking the money and forcing his way to the Knicks. While not as athletic as Denver Melo, it was in NYC where Anthony peaked as a shooter. It's also here where he gained more weight and started missing lots of games. He won *one* playoff series in his entire time with the Knicks. In the east, guys.

And then it got worse. Knicks Melo never made the playoffs, let alone an all-nba team after 2013, so we can pretty much throw all those years out for top 5 purposes. Just because people still *thought* he was good, I went all the way to 2015, where became pretty clear he's wasnt even top 15 anymore. Kobe and Dirk start declining here, so I expanded it to **4** players besides LeBron. Still wasnt very hard. Durant basically slots in for Dirk as the new non-Lebron forward always clearly ahead of Melo.

As a sidenote: the Denver Nuggets won more games than the Knicks in 3 of the next 4 seasons (including 57 in 2012), and only finished behind in 2014 by 1 game (37 to 36).

Kobe | Duncan | Steph | Steph |
Durant | Durant | Durant | Durant |
CP3 | CP3 | CP3 | Westbrook | 
Dwight | M.Gasol | Harden | Harden |

##### 2013: The year Melo might have been top 5
Ok, even I have to admit this. In 2013, Melo has a decent case for his only top 5 season. He leads the league in scoring, shoots a good percentage, and even wins a playoff series. It's by far his best season as a Knick, and likely, the best season of his career. He has a career high in ws/48, with .184, and finishes 9th overall in offensive win shares (really high for him).

Melo also finishes 3rd in MVP voting, and while I think this is partially because of his exaggerated reputation at the time (and being in NYC), he did have a great year. 

Still though: LeBron, Durant, clearly better. CP3 has far better advanced stats and won more games in a harder conference.  Tim Duncan makes 1st team all-nba, and is the best player on the Spurs team that goes to the finals. Marc Gasol wins Defensive player of the year, wins more games, and goes to the western conference finals. He finishes *3rd* in VoRP behind LeBron and Durant. It's counter-intuitive, but Gasol has a really strong argument. That's 5, but we also have Harden and Curry starting to push their way into the conversation, and honestly, I'd take either of them over Melo in 2013. That's 7. 

Maybe I'm wrong there. Maybe Melo was top 5 in 2013. But that would be his *one* year as a top 5 player. One very debatable season. The next year he misses the playoffs and falls out of the conversation forever.

425,425,[OC] Taco Tuesdays have eaten into LeBron’s productivity and I have the data to prove it.,"One of the most unappetizing developments in the NBA is LeBron James’ recent obsession with Taco Tuesdays[.](https://imgur.com/a/TzuaeHS) And I’m not talking about the broader issue of [cultural appropriation](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2019/11/12/20940959/lebron-james-taco-tuesday-videos-lakers-problem) or his sad [attempt to trademark](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2851790-lebron-james-files-to-trademark-taco-tuesday-after-viral-social-media-posts) the phrase. I’m talking about how the King’s curious obsession with eating tacos on Tuesdays, has led to him eating Ls on the box score.

Almost every culture has a kind of taco. The Greeks have gyros. The French have crepes. Italians have calzones. Americans have Taco Bell. Folding dough around a medley of meat and veggies is a food concept as old as time. And while everyone enjoys tacos, some of us are more fanatic than others…

Enter [El Reye](https://www.elreytaqueria.com/), LeBron James.

<[LeBron James Taco Tuesday Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRDVaW1qA4)\>

The man’s awkward passion for Taco Tuesday tends to evoke mixed reactions: anywhere between smiling at the heartwarming dad vibes and a literal whole-body cringe. And I won’t deny, as a proper Houstonian who takes his tacos very seriously, I was suspicious when I first heard grumblings of the [Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_Hispanic_and_Latino_population)\-native’s weekly affair. So, I looked to the numbers to see if there is more to this meat-and-cheese filled story.

# “It’s just like Taco Tuesdays. It’s a (expletive) thing.”

Before biting into the data, I needed to pinpoint the origins of James’ taco-bsession (taco-obsession, hehe). After an exhaustive multi-minute googling sesh, the earliest observance I could find is this [Instagram story](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=507218733062687) from August 2018.

Just a few weeks later we got further confirmation of LeBron’s enthusiasm for weekday alliteration-themed occasions during a post-practice Q&A. His fervent response to the media’s questions about his “[White Boy Wednesdays](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/lakers/2018/09/26/lebron-lakers-eminem-white-boy-wednesday/1437137002/)” playlist gave it all away:

>*“It’s a universal thing, right?’’ he asked reporters, with a smile. “It’s just like taco Tuesdays. It’s a (expletive) thing.”*

*It’s a (expletive) thing.* Profound words with profound implications. It’s at this point we can confidently presume Taco Tuesday is a staple in the James house. His videos would increase in frequency and social media buzz throughout the 2018-19 season before reaching a zeitgeist level of furor with this May ‘19 [insta-story](https://twitter.com/BleacherReport/status/1133586182720430080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1133586182720430080%7Ctwgr%5E&ref_url=about%3Ablank).

Thus, we can split LeBron’s career is into two distinct periods:

* **Pre-Taco Tuesday Era**: 2003-04 – 2017-18 seasons
* **Taco Tuesday Era**: 2018-19 – 2019-20 seasons

With a reliable taco timeline established, it’s time to count the beans.

# The Taco-nalysis

I began by compiling LeBron’s career game logs (the population) and identifying the day of the week each game was played on. Next, I pulled in his Season Averages (the control group) and selected the following 10 stat categories to get a comprehensive picture of his performance: [Game Score](https://www.nba.com/resources/static/team/v2/thunder/statlab-gamescore-191201.pdf), Points, Field Goal %, 3-Point %, Free Throw %, Total Rebounds, Assists, Steals, Blocks, and Turnovers. For each of these stats, I compared his average performance for each day of the week to his overall average for the corresponding season.

Example: for the 2003-04 NBA season, LeBron averaged 20.9 Points per game. On Sundays that season, he averaged 26.6 Points per game. So, for Sunday during the ‘03-04 season, LeBron had a Points per game variance of +27.3%. This calculation is repeated for each day of the week for each of the 10 stat categories for each of LeBron’s seasons in the league.

<[Example of Analysis](https://imgur.com/r1tNBxo)\>

A 5% variance threshold was used to clearly delineate between good and bad performances. Meaning, daily stat averages greater than +5% of the season average are considered “Positive” (green), variances less than -5% are considered “Negative” (red) and variances within those bounds are considered “Neutral” (yellow). This threshold divided the data points into the three stratums equally.

# Pre-Taco Tuesday Era

This analysis examined 1,050 total data points from the period before LeBron discovered tacos (10 stats x 7 days per week x 15 seasons) and found an unambiguous trend: The King played better on [*Tuesdays*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaA9EBPgdQI).

<[Pre-Taco Tuesday Era - % of Variances by Day of Week](https://imgur.com/lweNvDu)\>

Since LeBron entered the league, his Tuesday night performances had registered the lowest rate of Negative variances and the highest rate of Positive variances. Meaning, Tuesday is the day he was *least* likely to perform *worse* than his season average, and the day he was *most* likely to perform *better* than his season average.

When looking at the stat variances cumulatively, his Tuesday performance stands out even more!

<[Pre-Taco Tuesday Era - Cumulative Avg Stat Variances by Day of Week](https://imgur.com/ZLRuKu2)\>

Tuesdays had a Total Average Variance of 2.4%. Meaning, in the pre-Taco Tuesday era, LeBron posted an average stat line +2.4% better than his season average on Tuesday nights.

And with LeBron being undoubtedly the best player on his teams, we’d expect that Tuesday performance bump to be reflected in the Win/Loss column… It was.

<[Pre Taco-Tuesday Era - Win % by Day of Week](https://imgur.com/OYsznFX)\>

He came out victorious in 71% of his Tuesday outings in the pre-Taco Tuesday era - more than 4% better than his overall win rate for the same period.

This is where things get bleak. LeBron-stans, now would be the time to log off.

# Oh, How the Tacos have Turned

Everyone thought LeBron’s biggest weakness was his hairline. Turns out, it’s tacos.

Prior to his weekly taco tradition, LeBron’s Tuesday performance had the lowest rate of negative variances and the highest rate of positive variances. In the first two seasons of the Taco Tuesday era, James’ sacred day saw an +11% uptick in negative variances and a -17% drop in positive variances.

<[Taco Tuesday Era - % of Variances by Day of Week](https://imgur.com/9U52kqx)\>

Looking at the stats in aggregate we get an even better sense for his drop in Tuesday performance. LeBron is suddenly performing notably worse than his season average in most of the key stats! A complete reversal of the trend from the days before his taco titillations.

<[Taco Tuesday Era - Cumulative Avg Stat Variances by Day of Week](https://imgur.com/7yqOxme)\>

Suffice it to say, LeBron’s average Tuesday performance has fallen flatter than Casa Ole’s® velveeta-covered tostada. For those of you residing outside the great state of Texas, allow this trip advisor review to enlighten you on our state’s worst Mexican chain.

<[Casa Ole Review](https://imgur.com/gsPK5cA)\>

Similar to how Montezuma’s revenge transforms local cuisines into violent bowel movements, we’d expect LeBron’s *shitty* Tuesday performance to translate to the Win/Loss column… it did.

<[Taco Tuesday Era - Win % by Day of Week](https://imgur.com/5CW6EPT)\>

Since the weekday shenanigans began, LeBron’s Tuesday Win % has lagged his overall Win % by -2%.

To put all these numbers into perspective, here’s a few Taco-mparisons for you to consider.

These graphs give a sense of just how different LeBron’s Tuesday nights were in the two eras.

# Ta co-nclude

It’s becoming difficult to separate LeBron’s on-court performance from his escalating taco mania. Whether he’s [sending taco trucks](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/lakers/2019/10/29/lebron-james-sends-taco-truck-feed-first-responders-california-wildfires/2501709001/) to the California firefighters, leading the Staples Center in an [arena-wide taco chant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5xC5OOgK4s), or his recent feature on Migos’ *Taco Tuesday* track – LeBron has progressively made the Latin street food a part of his identity.

<[*Taco Tuesday* track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3aDutHedqM)\>

After examining 17 seasons of data the findings are clear: LeBron James’ Tuesday performance has gotten measurably worse since his Taco Tuesday antics began.

So, what does this mean for LeBron and the Lakers?

Well, in the short run, they don’t have too much to worry about. The NBA curiously scheduled no Tuesday night matchups for the Lakers in the bubble restart. I don’t mean to stoke the r/nba conspiracy flames but if that sus pattern holds for the playoff schedule, we’ll need an official response from Adam Silver.

<[Lakers Bubble Schedule](https://imgur.com/a/AKPAKSr)\>

*Note: the author* [*contacted the*](https://imgur.com/a/1ofjV3y) *the NBA League Office for comment but they did not respond prior to posting on reddit.*

Looking past the current season, however, should Jeanie Buss and the Lakers consider intervening?

On the one hand, LeBron should face the mariachi music and acknowledge the way he’s let down his teammates, coaches and fans these past two taco-slowed seasons.

On the other hand, despite his Tuesday distraction and the performance decline it’s wrought, LeBron had an MVP-caliber season and led his team to the #1 seed in the Western conference[.](https://media.giphy.com/media/26Fxuue3LMkwbs3Sg/giphy.gif)

What his teammates, coaches and fans deserve most is an unencumbered LeBron. An on-court LeBron who’s fully present *every* time he suits up; undistracted by the allure of alliteration themed dinner nights. And, an off-court LeBron who can freely indulge his primal taco impulses each and every Tuesday night. A LeBron so fully self-actualized it’d make Michael stop crying.

Thus, the data offers but one solution: **Taco Load Management**

Frank Vogel should rest LeBron on Tuesday nights so he can pursue his conflicting passions uninhibited.

in hopes that sweet upvotes soon would be there,

The Canadians were nestled all snug at Tim Hortons, visions of Nav dancing, they cried out “oh Board Man” 

And Magic in LA and Ballmer there too,
They’d just calmed the hell down, which was long over due.

When all of a sudden there arose a new tweet, 
People sprang to hit new, to see who had who beat. 

Away to their phones they flew like a flash
They smashed on f5, and prayed the whole internet didn’t crash.

Lebron sees his chance of a new superteam grow, 
But ask him if it is one and I’m sure he’ll say no,

When what to our wondering eyes should appear,
Why a brand new post right there in the clear,

With a little bold writer, so lively and quick,
I knew in that moment a woj bomb I did click,

More rapid than raptors his words they came,
And he stayed very silent, his sources he never names,

Now SIMMONS, now SHAMS, now SKIP and SHANNON, 
on RDA, on Masai, on Windhorst and JALEN,

To the top of the window! To the Top of r/all!
The excitement’s so palpable there’s sweat on my balls. 

As band wagoners that before a big trade trade fly,
When someone calls out their flair switch, they say “bye bitch, bye.”

False alarm?! Yes sadly, Woj did have some news,
about the Greek freak?!... YES! but just about his new shoes,

They sprang to their helicopter, the cameramen they did go, 
And away they all flew to a car, #tbt to that white bronco.

448,448,I sold Josh Hart a Nintendo Switch in 2017. And he has paid me back,"A few months ago I posted about my situation with now former Los Angeles Lakers Guard, Josh Hart. If your not familiar with the story, [here it is](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/brvala/i_sold_josh_hart_a_switch_in_2017_and_he_still/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).

I never expected it to get the kind of attention it did. My plan was to share a pretty unique story with people, hopefully get Josh's attention and just get some tickets. Comments were hilarious and people's opinions are always good to read. I was pretty taken back with the kind of support people where willing to give me, one person going as far as to wanting to start a GoFundMe to get some tickets. So just a quick shout out to the people of Reddit, you guys are amazing.

July 6th, the Lakers acquired Anthony Davis. The Woj Bomb hit my phone and when I came across Josh Hart's name in the trade, I couldn't help but laugh. My friends hitting me up about it and even some Redditors taking some jabs at me. [Sacrifices had to be made I suppose.](https://np.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/c134ht/some_sacrifices_had_to_be_made_for_anthony_davis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) Josh and I actually contacted each other a few times over Twitter after the trade. He assured me that he was still going to take care of me, and I wasn't in any kind of rush. The kid just got traded, and I imagine for a young player that can be pretty hectic.

[He sent me a box in the mail.](https://imgur.com/a/gvtdKou) A pair of Nike Lakers Shorts, a Lakers warm up shirt, a Lakers long sleeve shirt, 2 hats and a bag. But the cherry on top...a pair of signed game worn Kobe's, and a signed game worn number 5 rookie Josh Hart jersey. I have never owned anything game worn before, so I was floored. The smile this put on my face made me realize, I am completely happy with what I got.

Being a life long Lakers fan, I jumped at the opportunity to sell a Laker something just to have a cool story out of it. At the end of the day, I have a better story than I could have imagined. Am I going to get tickets? I don't know, and I'm not expecting them. I can always buy tickets, (as expensive as they may be) but this story and what I got in the end is worth more to me than tickets.

If there is anything more that I could ask for I guess, would be to meet Josh in person and have a laugh about all of this. That, and maybe a few rounds of Smash Bros. 4 stock, no items, Final Destination. I play a pretty mean Snake.

Edit: Apologies if I came off as asking for more. That was not my intention whatsoever. I could've made a better choice of words, but I don't expect anymore. I could've done without the smash Bros comment, but I wasn't asking for more. I got more than I asked for.",nba

>Ribbing, in fact, became an essential part of the Golden State program. In his upcoming memoir, The Sixth Man, Warriors forward Andre Iguodala recalls a team-building exercise in which players were asked to recall the moments in a game during which they felt the highest. “When Klay’s turn came, we all assumed he was going to say that his highest moment was the the day he scored 37 points in a quarter against Sacramento,” Iguodala writes. “I mean, that was an NBA record! But he didn’t. Instead he said, ‘My best moment was one night I caught a pass and I was like fifty feet from the basket and I was about to shoot it. And all of a sudden, I hear Andre being like, ‘What the fuck, Klay? You’re fifty feet out.’ And I thought about it for a second and shot it anyway.

556,556,"[Bishop] Laura Ingraham says LeBron James should ""shut up and dribble"" and leave political comments to people who didn't leave high school a year early.","&nbsp;

[**Laura Ingraham of Fox News says LeBron James and Kevin Durant should just ""shut up and dribble""**](https://streamable.com/tdw2q)

---

**Transcript:**

>**I'm numb to this commentary, like! Must they run their mouths like that? Unfortunately, a lot of kids and some adults take these ignorant comments seriously. Look, there might be a cautionary lesson in LeBron for kids. This is what happens when you attempt to leave high school a year early to join the NBA. And it's always unwise to seek political advice from someone who gets paid a hundred million dollars a year to bounce a ball. Oh and LeBron and Kevin? You're great players but no one voted for you. Millions elected Trump to be their coach. So keep the political commentary to yourself, or as someone once said, ""shut up and dribble"".**

**[Bonus](https://streamable.com/7syqn) (she continued after returning from break):**

>**I'm still trying to get over the fact that Kevin Durant said, ""I feel like our country is not *ran* by a great coach."" Does that mean I should go for a *ran* tomorrow morning before my radio show? Oh my goodness.**

573,573,"Not enough is made of the fact that LeBron got Kevin Love to join him in Cleveland and commit long-term, but then LeBron himself didn't commit long-term and routinely undercut Love in one way or another. And through all that Love never complained once and appreciated everything.","Kevin Love changed his game more than anyone to adapt to playing with LeBron. He also bore the brunt of LeBron's frustrations during his Cavs tenure with indirect jabs and rumors of trades involving Love.

This is a summary of how Brian Windhorst described it on The Lowe Post:

> Kyrie Irving ""opted out of what Love is dealing with,"" Windhorst said. ""Love deals with the persecution of being a LeBron teammate, of being blamed, of dealing with his social-media undercutting, of being the fall guy, as he's called himself.""

> He added: ""There have been so many days and nights where Kevin Love has walked out of a building feeling beleaguered or beaten down either directly because of LeBron"" or indirectly.

> But Windhorst says Love insists that it's all worth it because playing with James also means playing late into the season and competing for championships.

> ""I have to give Kevin a real major hat tip for being a professional and being an adult about it,"" Windhorst said. ""He has always seen the big picture ... He has always maintained that this is all worth it, that playing in these late games — I mean, this is a guy who played for six years, whatever it was, never sniffed the playoffs. He's like: 'This is where I'm at right now. This is the charge for playing with [James].'"" 

For fuck's sake, Kevin Love literally developed anxiety and stress to the point of having panic attacks and you have to think some of that was due to the pressure of playing with LeBron.

Despite all that LeBron to the very end never seemed to appreciate what Love went through for him. When he signed with the Lakers, Love found out from a notification and HE called LeBron to tell him he loved him.

Man, I just really admire Kevin Love and his strength and big heart in the face of what he puts up with.

Also, I had to dig pretty deep so some of the players are recently retired or are currently in the D-League.

If Doctor J, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Kareem, Bill Russell and those guys could play every night in crappy shoes, fly commercial, and make $100,000 a year, a guy making $40-$50 million a year don’t need ‘Load Management’.

Barkley remembers those days well. As a rookie with the Sixers, he felt compelled to assist his family and his boys from Leeds financially. But as the years went on, accommodating everyone who had a hand out became a burden, a distraction -- and a trigger for stress.

677,677,The NBA should apologize to Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf,"Watching the season restart last night with all of the mentions of Black Lives Matter, messages on jerseys, and kneeling for the anthem was amazing. But it reminded me how far the league has come since 1996 when Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf decided to stop standing for the national anthem in protest. The next year he found himself out of the league at 29 years old. He played overseas and came back for one more year but never got much of a chance.

With the way the NBA is handling these protests now I really think Adam Silver should make a gesture of apology to him and use it as a moment to show how far we have come. He wasn't a huge NBA figure but he was way ahead of his time to protest during a time where the most famous player in the league was apolitical at best. What do you guys think? How could the NBA apologize/honor him? This moment just feels like the right time to me.

683,683,Is having Lebron really worth the trouble?,"People were interested in seeing how I came up with the value Lebron brings to the Cavs, Dan Gilbert, and Downtown Cleveland as a whole. I've decided to make this thread so those that were interested could see how I arrived at the valuation.

A few days ago an interesting thread arose accusing Lebron of handicapping the Cavs this offseason. Because of his contract demands for his friends, the Cavs could not make many offseason moves. Further, they're having to pay tens of millions in luxury tax just to make this man happy. This prompted u/jushin33 to ask:
> Has anyone looked at how much value Cavs would lose if Lebron left vs the tax savings? 

Why is Dan Gilbert so willing to pay out the nose in luxury taxes rather than let Lebron walk and pocket the savings? Surely he's not worth it at this point, right? 

Let’s begin by looking at attendance before we get into the financial aspect. How many more faces travel to Quicken Loans Arena to see the King?

> Attendance prior to return: 17,329
> Return: 20,562
> 2017: 20,562

Given 41 home games, this is 132,553 more people coming in yearly compared to the most recent season without him.

With playoffs that is at LEAST another 164,496 people whose offseason has not come early provided there is a minimum 8 playoff home games. To get this number I accounted for the fact that QLA would have a patronage of 0 because the team has not made the playoffs without Lebron in the last 20 years, so each home game is an increase by 20,562. 

Interesting to note, Quicken Loans Arena max capacity is, you’ve guessed it, 20,562 people. The arena has been sold out every game since Lebron’s return. 
 
Now let's look at revenue:
> Year before: $145M
> Return: $149M
> 2017: $233M

I’m going to say 2015 was an outlier year. Lebron announced his return in July, 3 months before the NBA season began. The organization may have needed time to adjust to the sudden good fortune. In 2016, after having Lebron for a full regular and offseason, the team took advantage of his prowess, posting a revenue of $191M.

A lot of people asked about playoff revenue. The Cavaliers make an average of $81 per fan at full capacity during the regular season. Assuming a sweep each round, we get 8 hosted home games per post season. **This gives us $13,324,176 a year in revenue brought in** **SOLELY FROM HAVING LEBRON ON THE TEAM**. He’s been a lock to make the finals every year and, for a team that suffered four straight years of zero playoff games, this is literally money they would not see without him.

The Cavaliers had an operating loss of 40m in the 2017 season. I should note that this is the only loss the team has seen since drafting Lebron. This is wholly attributed to the dramatic increase in player expenses this year. In 2016 the team spent 87M on players. In 2017, this number rose to a whopping $131M. Before that, the Cavaliers went from an average operating income of $10m a year without Lebron, to $22.5M a year between 2015-2016. This is interesting to note because, given these figures, the team’s actual operating hit from adding Lebron drops to around $16M. 

Mr. Gilbert has suffered a net loss from re-signing Lebron of $16M…so far. Let’s see if he makes it back into the black. 


The Cavalier’s player expense hit is a sight to behold. Luxury tax ain’t no joke. However, after this season, the Cavaliers have a lot of salaries coming off the books and will only have $80-90M in owed player expenses. Were Dan Gilbert to resign Lebron, find cheaper talent, and maintain a revenue stream of, let’s say $200M to be conservative, he would make out like a bandit. Lebron would demand a salary higher than Curry’s and Harden’s, yes, but the team also has multiple deals coming in that would offset this. Goodyear, I believe, just signed on a $10m/year logo placement and the local tv deal of ten years at $26m a year ended this past season and is expected to at least double when the new deal is signed. All of that is in the future, however. Let’s look at what Lebron has already brought him.
> **Edit: Some people are taking issue with his impact on the valuation of the team as a whole. Whether it be the Clippers sale or revenue sharing. It was just a quick thing I noticed while putting this together and thought it would be interesting to add. Has no effect on the amount of revenue Lebron generates yearly. Dude brings in bank. I'll still leave it below, though.** 
> 
> Cavs value year before return: 515M
> Year of: 915M
> 2017: $1.2B
> 
> Wow. Dan Gilbert’s networth is $5.1B. The team he purchased at $375M has ballooned to become an asset worth $1.2B. ~~Lebron is literally responsible for $825M of his net worth from basketball operations alone.~~

Basketball operations alone? Donajello, are you saying that Lebron has generated even MORE wealth for Dan Gilbert? Short answer: yes. Long answer: …you should probably sit down for this.

With foot traffic in downtown Cleveland skyrocketing with everyone coming to watch Lebron play, it is only natural that local businesses would reap the rewards. Dan Gilbert is the largest solo investor into the downtown Cleveland economy. He has invested more than $1B into the area and is the owner of 12 local businesses. This includes clubs, bars, and restaurants – all things people look for after a high-octane game. Bar owners in the area, ranging from small to large, have seen an increase in revenue of 30-200% on game nights. Demand for local hotel rooms have risen 8.6% since Lebron’s return. Lebron’s presence “increased the number of restaurants within 1 mile of a stadium by about 12.8% and the number of eating and drinking establishments by about 13.7%” to meet demand per a Harvard study. Employment in the hospitality industry in increased 9.9% upon the King’s return.

How much is all this worth? A study funded by the city of Cleveland along with the Cavaliers that was conducted by The Plain Dealer estimated in 2010 that Lebron James was key to bringing $135 per additional person downtown to see a home game. This includes parking, dinners, occasional hotels, and other expenses. That’s about $600k a night and $18,265,500 a year. The study also estimated that the downtown area sees an increase in foot traffic of 105,000 during playoffs. That gives us $113,400,000 over 8 home games. Note: the original estimate in the study of $180 included ticket prices. I’ve removed the $45 average ticket price because we are solely looking at revenue outside of the stadium. Their number did NOT include concession spending. 

**TL;DR: Dan Gilbert suffered a $40m loss, $27m of that coming from luxury taxes last season. Lebron increased team revenue by $88M from the highest grossing year without him to today. Outside of the stadium Lebron is responsible for $18,265,500 in spending during the season in downtown Cleveland, and $113,400,000 during playoffs. Dan Gilbert owns the Cavaliers and is the largest investor into downtown Cleveland to the tune of over $1B and 12 businesses.**

**Lebron has brought in about $219,665,500 a year just by coming back home.**

**Why would Dan Gilbert and the organization hop, jump, and skip to please Lebron, even to the point of paying exorbitant luxury taxes to sign his friends? Well, the proof is in the numbers. No king has been this profitable since Midas.**  

Edit 2: Lebron has even brought me gold. Is there anything this man cannot do? Seriously, thank you kind stranger.

Going to quickly clarify a few common questions. (Like 100 folks asked the same things)

1. The City of Cleveland reported an increase in traffic to the downtown area of 105,000 PER DAY A HOME PLAYOFF GAME WAS PLAYED. $135 * (105,000*8) for the lowest estimate.

2. $135 doesnt mean every person literally spent $135 per night. The city took their increased revenue and divided by the increased traffic on game nights.

3. No Dan Gilbert doesn't make every penny of the 131M/year Lebron brings to the downtown area... However, businesses saw an average yearly increase in revenue ranging from 30% to 200% depending on their size, much of this coming during the period of playoffs. Gilbert owns billions worth of businesses in the area, revenue of those businesses increased as a direct result of the increased spending.

4. The Clippers sold for $2B. Thanks, I get it. Lebron isn't responsible for ALL of the 1.2B valuation, but he does add to it. However, that has ZERO impact on the revenue he brings in from people who come to see him play, which is my main concern. No one travels to Cleveland because they heard the Clippers were sold. C'mon now. ",nba

Edit: I'm actually being serious about this.  What if we got a ton of people to email someone inside the Hawks organization?  They might not actually care, but if enough people said something about it then maybe they would tell him to stop just to shut everyone else up.",nba
701,701,Kukoc got done dirty in this doc. Had less mentions in whole doc than Steve Kerr for example.,"In episode 9 when they were talking about game 7 against Pacers, you had whole segment where they had Reggie mentioning some Steve Kerr's shot, then Steve Kerr talking about the game, then showing 2 threes made by Kerr that game. Meanwhile all they had from that game about Kukoc is him being scored on twice.

 But in reality Kerr had 11 pts that game on 3/7 FGA, while Kukoc had 21 pts with 7/11 FGA. 3/4 threes made. Kukoc made 14pts on 5/5 FGA in third quarter and kept Bulls in game. But had no mention.

 Then it comes big segment about game 5 against Jazz in the finals and again not a single mention of Kukoc who had 30pts that game on a RIDICULOUS EFFICIENCY with 11/13 FGA. 4/6 from threes and was only starter in +. MJ for example had 28 points on 9/26 FGA.Pippen had 6pts from 2/16 FGA. Kukoc's shooting was what made that game tight.

 They didn't mention that Phil Jackson drew the last shot FOR KUKOC because he was amazing that game which could have made Bulls win that game that MJ literally stole from Kukoc to airball it himself. Ridiculous shit if you ask me.

 Doc was pretty entertaining and good, but I don't know, it is a puff piece for Jordan and I didn't expect that Kukoc and Harper combined would get less recognition than Kerr in whole doc series lol.",nba

As someone that's had depression for years and never sought professional help, hearing that someone as successful as DeMar struggles with depression really hit home to me that depression can affect anyone. I recently decided to get help, and learning that an NBA star faces the same struggles I do helped me realise that I can't solve this alone. 

Thank you DeMar DeRozan. Your season may not have ended the way you wanted it to on the court, but it's still memorable for the dialogue you opened off the court. ",nba

And it's free, with no microtransactions or other gimmicks","I'm back again for my annual ""tell people about [Basketball GM](https://basketball-gm.com/) during the dead of the NBA offseason"" post! First of all, if you've never played Basketball GM, [give it a try](https://basketball-gm.com/), I think you might like it. It's a video game where you get to be the general manager of a pro basketball team, kind of like Football Manager or franchise mode in 2k. You sign players, draft players, make trades, manage the finances, and try not to get fired.

Most importantly: it's free. Actually free. That means no microtransactions or ""free to play"" or any kind of horrible corrupting nonsense like that.

If you've played Basketball GM before... listen, I'm not gonna lie to you. At its core, it's the same game it was a year ago. If you didn't like it then, you probably won't like it now. But if you did like it before, it's even better now! There have been a ton of small improvements, such as:

* More customization options in God Mode. [Add/remove teams](https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/cafqfp/in_god_mode_the_edit_team_info_page_has_been/), [don't allow your players to refuse to re-sign](https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/bxcca8/new_in_v201906060088_a_god_mode_option_to_disable/), [edit relatives of players](https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/btqh8w/more_minor_new_stuff_edit_relatives_when/), [use the new or old lottery odds](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2019/05/draft-lottery-updates/), [set hard/soft cap and playoff byes](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2018/11/new-options-hard-soft-cap-and-playoff-byes/), [edit playoff series lengths](https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/9i47ul/playoff_series_length_is_now_customizable/), and [load draft classes way into the future](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2019/07/far-future-draft-classes/).

* More depth, such as ways to view [family trees, tragic deaths, roster continuity, and the best players who never made the playoffs](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2019/05/frivolities/), [more realistic contracts and draft history in new leagues](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2018/11/more-realistic-new-leagues/), and [more](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2018/09/a-few-recent-minor-improvements/).

* A ton of UI improvements, like [""untouchable"" players and picks in trades](https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/9o9v7g/untouchable_players_and_picks_in_trades/), [dark mode](https://gfycat.com/distortedspottedcopepod), [play/pause/next buttons in live games](https://gfycat.com/idealcleveriberianmidwifetoad), [a sexy new playoffs UI](https://imgur.com/JCOkIai), [a ""Play > Until end of round"" menu item in the playoffs](https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/9e17bb/minor_new_feature_play_until_end_of_round_in_the/), and [a ""Download Spreadsheet"" button on nearly every table](https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/9s8r8p/download_spreadsheet_button_on_nearly_every_table/).

* Continued awesome work from the community on making [realistic rosters](https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/cc62sj/20192020_nba_roster_v_04_westbrook_to_rockets/) for [the current NBA and past seasons](https://nicidob.github.io/rosters/), running [multiplayer leagues](https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/wiki/basketball_gm_multiplayer_league_list), and [much more](https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2b9him/best_of_rbasketballgm/).

* Either the biggest or smallest news, depending on your perspective... [a brand new football version of the game](https://play.football-gm.com/).

Also since posting to /r/nba is where I got my initial userbase from, and Basketball GM has had such a huge positive impact on my life, I am very grateful for this community. Thank you. You are more than just copypasta! Although I do enjoy the pasta too.

I get to brag about my team once a decade, fuck off.)*

The Orlando Magic have come off the blocks hotter than a raccoon in a tin garbage can in the middle of June.  Whether it lasts will remain to be seen but as of right now they're knocking off heavyweights like the Cavs and Spurs like they're D-League teams and **bitch I am shook**.  We've been hot garbage ever since that tall ass pedophile dude left so ion even know what to do with myself right now.  Tried touching myself but I'm not gonna be able to get a nut off till we get that ring.  Blue ballin for the boys in blue.    

**THE TEAM**

We've got a scrappy squad of a bunch of young dick touchers coached by main man Frank the tank Vogel.  He's a cute guy for real.

**A-God** - This a real ass man right here.  He's young but he's got a big boy game now. Big dick shit only. Averaging 23 and 9 right now.  Please don't take him LA.  I swear to god.

**Vucci Mane** - This white boy right here is the truth.  We gotta make sure we get him in the racial draft next year before the race war.  Protect the Vooch

**The french dude** - I was low key mad when we traded away Dipo to give Fournier more minutes but imma take the L on that one cause my boy came through.  Also, Evan Fournier will fuck your girl.  And make you watch.  

*(Full disclosure:  I ate an edible like an hour and a half ago and that shit just hit me like a ton of bricks and I no longer have the energy to do the rest of the team.  You know the rest of them fools, just go with it)*


**THE CITY**

Orlando is mostly known as a vacation destination for people who think Olive Garden is fancy and Brazilian pickpockets.  Our two biggest celebrities of the past 10 years have been Casey Anthony and George Zimmerman.  [We are trash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6BKGpPIi58) and honestly North Korea should just nuke us.  We'd thank them.  

You ever wanted to go to a 2 story Sizzler?  You ever wanted to see a guy smoke crack in the middle of a highway?  Well this is your kinda place then.  We're close to Miami so we got pretty good drugs, but beyond that we're trash as hell.

Which is why the Magic not being trash is so vital to our life.  When you live in the **tackiest city in the country** you gotta do waht you gotta do.  Orlando is what most philosophers call a ""Garbage city"".  As in, its garbage, the people are garbage, there's garbage everywhere, crackheads will piss on your car, everyone is like 57% suicidal, just don't ever come here.

Now some of you are saying that since Jay's narration was [""pretty close to being word for word""](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/j46o1k/espn_is_showing_the_same_lakers_defense_analysis/g7gvvxc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) what I wrote, ESPN [must have been stealing my work](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/j46o1k/espn_is_showing_the_same_lakers_defense_analysis/g7gw044?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [they're trash](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/j46o1k/espn_is_showing_the_same_lakers_defense_analysis/g7gw25z?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for doing it/not giving me credit.

Here's my take: I honestly don't think it matters.

If it's a coincidence - and to clarify, I think it is - that we broke down the same play, that's dope! Jay Will sure as hell knows more about basketball than I do, and if he and I are watching and noticing the same things, that just means I'm doing something right.

If they actually did find inspiration from my post, that's awesome too. My purpose for making all of these posts has always been to share plays and strategies that I thought were cool/interesting with others so they could appreciate them too. Who cares if I'm the one sharing it or if ESPN is? We're all enjoying the beautiful game of basketball together.

""Westbrook is teaming with celebrated documentary filmmaker Stanley Nelson and “Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez” producer Blackfin for a series on the Tulsa race massacre of 1921, titled “Terror In Tulsa: The Rise And Fall of Black Wall Street.” The series is described as both an exploration of America’s past, and also a “urgent, sobering look at the social, economic and political lines that continue to divide the country.” It will inter-weave both past and present-day narratives in order to investigate the tragic event and its continuing impact.

“Spending 11 years in Oklahoma opened my eyes to the rich and sordid history of the state,” added Westbrook, referencing his stint as a player for the Oklahoma City Thunder. “When I learned about the heartbreaking events that happened in Tulsa nearly 100 years ago, I knew this was a story I wanted to tell. It’s upsetting that the atrocities that transpired then, are still so relevant today. It’s important we uncover the buried stories of African Americans in this country. We must amplify them now more than ever if we want to create change moving forward.”

854,854,"I found Maurice Harkless’s wallet, and this is what happened.","Picture evidence: https://imgur.com/gallery/I1gvBHx

I know this is more of a prime off-season post, however I believe I should post this here:

In the summer of 2018, I was a manager at my local movie theater (Central Florida area). I was 20 years old at the time, and I’ve always been a major fan of sports associations such as the NFL and NBA. For more context, I would consider myself someone with above-average knowledge on topics NBA-related. Anyways, one morning I was opening the building, and the janitor turned in a lost wallet that was found from the previous night. This was no ordinary wallet, as it was a checkered Louis Vuitton design with engraved initials. I tried looking to see if there was any contact information from the wallet, and I immediately spotted his name (If I ever lost my wallet, I would like if the person who found it contacted me).  I still can’t believe that he lost his wallet at this random movie theater outside of Orlando, FL during the off-season (The odds of the person knowing who he is and finding his wallet are probably wild). Continuing on, I was shocked and immediately tried to find ways to contact him on social media. I tried contacting Harkless and his manager on multiple platforms, until I finally received a response on Instagram (Picture #1). After talking back and forth via direct messages, I ended up sending out the wallet to his address, including a small letter displaying how much of a fan I was (I’m a magic fan and supported him when he was on the team). After he received the package, it took several days for a response, however he replied by telling me next time the trail blazers come in town to play the Magic, he will hook me up with two tickets as well as post game passes. I was so excited and ecstatic for something like this because I’m a huge fan of the Magic and I love to watch the blazers! I told all my family and friends what happened, and my girlfriend and I called out of work for that day so we could enjoy ourselves. Long story short, he ghosted me, and I never got those tickets. (Picture #3-#5).

Let me preface by saying that I don’t mind that he didn’t send anything in return for sending back his wallet. What I do mind is that he promised me something that he never went through with. Both me and my girl called out of work for this and I was so excited to go to the game and see what the post-game passes were all about. I’m a fan and this was a genuine let-down for me.

I’m still a fan of Maurice Harkless, and I’m glad to see he’s on a championship contender this year, however I am still extremely disappointed and upset in how he completely lied to me/ghosted me once he got the wallet (that I paid priority shipping for). 

TL;DR – Found Moe Harkless’ wallet and sent it back to him in the mail. He promised me tickets and post-game passes, however once he received the wallet in the mail, he ghosted me.

EDIT #1 : I was very cringey and perhaps a bit excessive with my messages, however I don’t apologize for trying to get his attention. 

EDIT #2 : I can see if he reads a message, and all of those final messages weren’t read. The only reason I sent those messages were basically to bump up our conversation.

EDIT #3 : bro!

EDIT #4 : thanks to those of you that are kind, i appreciate it! Several people are attacking me for “expecting a return” when the only reason I’m expecting something in return is because he said he would reward me. I’ve returned plenty of lost items before without a reward, but anyone would be disappointed if they were promised something that they didn’t receive.",nba

KD tore his *right* Achilles... 

Kobe tore his left Achilles. DeMarcus Cousins? Left. Wes Matthews? Left. Rudy Gay? Left. ~~Brandon Jennings? Left.~~ Chauncey Billups? Left. Elton Brand? Left.

Dominique Wilkins... right.

I know it doesn't matter as much as one's dominant shooting hand, but it still affects which leg he takes off from when driving to his dominant side, etc. 

Granted, Dominique's game wasn't the EXACT same; he lost a decent bit of athleticism but he was so good he was able to adapt his game and still be an elite player. He didn't go above the rim as much and started shooting a lot more. KD doesn't rely exclusively on his athleticism; obviously his first step matters a lot and he's a great finisher, but KD should have a far easier time adapting if he loses some athleticism as his primary strengths are his scoring touch and shooting ability. He's still a 7 footer who can get off a shot from anywhere.

Regardless, I felt like this was pretty interesting.

I tried to turn him into Jack Sikma, told him I was going to teach you how to play on the elbow, go on the wing, face up. It was confusing for him. It really didn’t fit his style of play.

>""The real truth as to why i started doing this early 5th grade, it was a cloaking device for me. During the summer of my 5th grade year I was around more family. Some that names will be left alone I was around more. I was sexually harassed, raped, abused, I even got accustomed to it because being at that age you don’t know what is what. I was a gullible curious kid that didn’t know what the real world was. I had a mindset that my hair was something that I can control. My hair was what I can make and create and be mine. And it gave my confidence. As of recently I wasn’t at my best. Previous History popping up in my head and it sucked mentally “demons”..... because of this virus, I began to truly look at myself in the mirror and see who I truly was even behind closed doors. Long story short I have found peace and internal happiness through this journey god willingly. I forgave everyone even the people that don’t deserve it why? Because it’s dead weight. Time doesn’t wait on anyone so why should I waste my time on it ? Me cutting my hair was more than a cut. My hair was a mask of me hiding the insecurity’s that I felt the world wasn’t ready for. But now better then ever. Out with old. In with the new. I have shed my skin mentally, emotionally, physically, and spiritually. Life will always be hard. Gotta play with the cards your dealt with and try and make a winning hand. And if you lose. It’s never a lost. It’s a lesson 🙏🏾. I’m gonna be off this for awhile still growing through this. Just know I love each and everyone one of y’all. Peace love and happiness 💕🙏🏾""

If they truly want to stop being the little brothers to the lakers and maybe get Kawhi in the process, they should just move back to San Diego. Kawhi already owns a house there.

After being bounced rather early in the playoffs it’s gonna be extremely awkward for Giannis in receiving the award. Also, it’s a regular season award, and the NBA needs to announce it right after the playoffs since it’s almost impossible to not factor in playoff performances when you announce the award so late.",nbadiscussion

997,2,Something about Jordan that is never brought up,"Deloris Jordan, sister of Michael Jordan, accuses her father of rape and nobody talks about it.

Excerpt from her book:

""Ending eight years after it first began and five years after losing my virginity to my father, it scares me to think how much longer the abuse would have went on had I not spit out the dreadful truth to my mother during one of our many heated disagreements.  Disagreements that were sometimes anything but pleasant and often featured no indication of love between the two of us.

So as she ranted and raved about how no slutty daughter of hers better get pregnant and bring any bastard children into her house.  I finally heard myself saying: “If I am so much of a slut, why don’t you keep your husband out of my bed?”

When I finally found the courage to let my father’s deeds tumble from my lips, I did not know what to expect, but I never in a million years would have guessed that my mother would turn on me. Her words of betrayals did far more damage to me than my father’s deeds. They spoke volumes to the fact that she really did not care about me, which my father obviously knew. It is because she was so expressive with her dislike for me that probably made my father know he could get away with violating me.

My father confessed his actions on the same day that I disclosed them to my mother. And on that frightful day of admission, I watched my mother, looking for a sign, any sign that she cared about me.

The memory of my father whispering in my ear during the wee hours of the night about the beauty of my body has played over and over in my head for many years. And as if that has not been incapacitating enough by itself, having to comprehend the fact that more often than not, he had just gotten out of the bed he shared with my mother to find his way to my bedroom has just added to the realization of the painful situation.""

For some as famous as Michael Jordan, I'm very surprised at learning about this recently. I researched the guy a ton of times in my life and never heard of this. I happened to find this when googling his family and noticing he had a sister almost never mentioned. You would think this would be huge news.",nbadiscussion

999,4,Hall of Fame guard Steve Nash has signed a four-year contract to become the next coach of the Brooklyn Nets,"Woj tweet: https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1301515827783573504

>Hall of Fame guard Steve Nash has signed a four-year contract to become the next coach of the Brooklyn Nets, sources tell ESPN.

Super out of left field for me personally, did anyone hear any rumors or anything?

Looking forward to see what Steve can provide for the nets, was always a favourite player of mine, do you think he'll be able to wrangle KD and Kyrie? Very interested to see what kind of offence he will be implementing, maybe some iteration of 7 Seconds or Less?",nbadiscussion
1000,5,Eric Spoelstra brilliantly waited until the last play to swarm LeBron.,"On TV former coach Jeff Van Gundy was pleading with Spoelstra to get it out of LeBron's hands the last five minutes of the game.  Spoelstra stubbornly stayed with his regular defense, until he didn't.  On the last play *all five* of the Heat players swarmed LeBron, and LeBron passed it to Green.

The surprise factor was important.  LeBron's pass was off because it wasn't what he planned to do.  Green's shot was off because he wasn't expecting to shoot.  The rest of the Lakers had no idea what to do next because they had been watching LeBron take over for the last five minutes of the game.

Imagine the confidence it took for Spoelstra to hold off on that tactic until the very last play, despite LeBron seemingly scoring at will.  It reminds me of Michael Jordan's last game in a Bulls uniform, when he waited until the very last defensive play of the game to double team Karl Malone in the post and steal the ball.  Sometimes you hold your fire until it matters most.",nbadiscussion
1001,6,"Klay Thompson, will you please rise up to the occasion?!","1. 2015, GSW goes down 1-2 against Memphis. Klay numbers in the next 3 games for GSW to close the series: **18,6 PPG, 45 FG%, 61 3p%**
2. 2016, Steph Curry goes down game one against Houston and he is out until game 4 against Portland. In the meantime Klay leads GSW to 4-1 win vs Rockets and 2-1 lead vs Portland while averaging: **28,5 PPG, 48 FG%, 43 3P%** 
3. 2016, GSW goes down 3-1 against OKC. Klay numbers in the next three games for his team to make a comeback: **29,6 PPG, 40 FG%,  45 3P%** 
4. 2018, Curry is out for the first round against San Antonio and game 1 vs New Orleans. Klay numbers: in those 6 games: **23.3 PPG,  52 FG%, 48 3P%**
5. 2018, GSW goes down 2-3 against Rockets. Klay numbers in the next two games for his team to make a comeback: **27 PPG,  59 FG%, 53 3P%**
6. 2019, Kevin Durant goes down against Houston game 5, series being tied 2-2. Klay numbers in the closing two games: **27 PPG, 52 FG%, 52 3P%**
7. 2019, Klay numbers in the Finals: **26 PPG,  55 FG%, 59 3P%**

During GSW 5 straight NBA Finals they were either down a star player(Durant, Curry) or being behind in the series for total 8 times. If we exclude one occasion(2015 Finals game 4,5,6). Klay Thompson numbers in those 7/8 situations are:

**25,71 PPG,  50 FG%,  51 3P%**

These are during the most high pressure/ highest stakes a player can face. His lowest playoff moments are when his team is dominating and he is not forcing himself over the team flow to boost his numbers. Do people realize how important is this quality for a star player? You can see how ridicules is that some consider Klay ""just a role player"", ""not being able to lead"", ""never getting critisized"", ""hidding behind Curry or Durant"". 

IMO players like Booker, Beal, Oladipo, Butler shouldn't be put in the same category as Klay. Even someone like Paul George hardly has a case to be taken over him. Bottom line - a player's impact for winning is the most important stat that you can have. It doesn't matter if you get it while being 2nd, 3rd option or not dribbling the ball much. What Klay Thompson brings to the table is ""success"" in a way many of us can't imagine.",nbadiscussion
1002,7,Dennis Rodman won 7 straight rebounding titles in the 90's. During that time he had more offensive rebounds than field goals attempted.,"From the 1991-92 to the 1997-98 season, Dennis Rodman was the NBA's leading rebound each year. He averaged 16.7 rebounds per game during that time, including 5.8 offensive rebounds. He also averaged only 5.4 field goals attempted per game. For those 7 seasons, Rodman grabbed 2,714 offensive rebounds (over 600 more than Mutombo who was 2nd in that time despite playing 82 more games than Rodman), and took just 2,546 shot attempts (192 players took more shots in that time including guys like Popeye Jones, Dino Radja, and Bison Dele)",nbadiscussion
1003,8,What takeaways can we take from the Lakers-Heat series?,"So these are my takeaways from the finals. 

1. Almost all role players are now shooters on virtually every team. It's extremely noticeable WHEN a role player is a non shooter.
2. Passing out of layups to get 3s will continue. All these long and cross court passes often result in a ton of miscues and transition offense. 
3. As virtually every team has invested in shooting, winning will come down to the question of what you can do WITHIN THE ARC in clutch, when the shooters are hitting their shots. Stars don't necessarily NEED to shoot threes if they possess transcendent skills to get their team over the hump. 
4. More 3 point shots mean there will be more long rebounds. Rebounding and boxing out from the guard positions proved essential and was a big difference between the Lakers and Heat. 
5. Attacking the rim is still the most important skill a player can possess. 
6. 5s that lack skills will continue to be liabilities. 
7. Jimmy Butler is and has been a superstar.
8. Bam needs help on the boards.
9. Anthony Davis is a transcendent defensive player.
10. Both squads will likely get better without doing very much adding to the team. 
11. Game 5 was a classic.
12. Kyle Kuzma is a huge disappointment.",nbadiscussion
1004,9,I feel like people are downplaying the severity of KD's achilles injury.,"When reading people's projections about the 2020-2021 Nets, I've seen quite a lot of people say that KD's achilles rupture will have little effect on KD, with some people even saying ""It will have no effect at all"" because his game relies mainly on skill, not athleticism, and that Cousins and KD are similar in height and play style. 

People underestimate how important athleticism is in regards to muscle memory. LeBron in his prime had a 44 inch vertical for example. If an injury took it down to 38 instantly, he'd still be very athletic, but that's now 6 inches off of his layups, jump shots, fadeaways etc that he has to adjust for in relatively speaking, what is a short amount of time. So even if post injury he's still athletic relative to the rest of the league, it would still be a big change for him personally. It's not like athleticism and skill are used separately when playing, it's a continuum in which every player finds themselves relying on both.

In regards to KD, yes he's a 6'11 small forward, but now he's a 6'11 small forward that's going to get less lift, not be able to blow by people as quickly, get less separation with his handle, have trouble accelerating and decelerating etc. His height is still advantageous, but it's not like KD is as good as he was JUST because of his height, he had the guard like quickness and agility to accompany it. So saying he's going to be exactly the same after an achilles rupture is just incredibly wishful thinking to me. 

Equating him to Cousins also seems inaccurate. Cousins is a big man, KD is a wing, and whilst he can play a small ball 4 their styles are still different. Quick off the dribble mid range J's weren't exactly Boogies bread and butter like with KD. His game relied on positioning and strength, and even when he drived from the perimeter in the half court, he didn't need to get much if any separation from his man and could just use his muscle, unlike KD.

Furthermore, people seem to be just forgetting that this isn't his first injury. He's previously suffered a Jones fracture, and and an ankle injury. So we'll be getting a 32 year old KD coming off of his 3rd injury. It's not like I want KD to fail either btw, I wish he could come back 100%, the man plays beautiful basketball, but there's just not a historic precedent for such optimism I feel. Elgin Baylor, Chauncey Billups, Isiah Thomas, Kobe, Cousins, Rudy Gay, Verejao, Wesley Mathews, Brandon Jennings etc, none of em looked the same after their injuries. So I find it unlikely KD will be much different.",nbadiscussion
1005,10,Is the 94-95 Rockets championship the most underrated in recent history?,"When people talk about ""hard"" rings and which championships are ""worth the most"", the default answer is usually the 2011 Mavericks who won with only 1 star and a bunch of smart veterans all playing their part.

I feel like one of the more forgotten championships is the 1994-1995 Houston Rockets, who may have taken the hardest possible path to a ring in recent memory. Maybe it's because it fell into Jordan's gap year, but when you look at what the Rockets accomplished in that year it's pretty remarkable.

Their starting lineup was Hakeem Olajuwon, Kenny Smith, Vernon Maxwell, Robert Horry and Clyde Drexler (who they traded for at the deadline, great move). Hakeem makes 3rd team All-NBA behind Shaquille O'Neal on the 2nd team and MVP David Robinson on the 1st team.

The Rockets had won the championship the year before, yet they finished as the 6th seed in the West with only a 47-35 record, 11 games worse than the year before. 29-17 before the All-Star break and a break even of 18-18 post ASB, even after acquiring Drexler. They are the lowest-seeded team to ever win the championship.

Then you look at the teams they beat to get to the finals:

First round they defeat the 3rd seeded 60-22 Utah Jazz in 5 games (best of 5), winning the deciding game in Utah. Hakeem and Clyde combine for 60/15/8/3/3 averages on elite efficiency to upset the Jazz. Malone was great while Stockton was arguably beaten by Kenny Smith, with Kenny averaging 18 points on 81% TS while (presumably) defended by Stockton.

In the second round they come up against the 2nd seed 59-23 Phoenix Suns. Drexler was good, not great, but Hakeem was excellent and did a relatively good job defending Barkley. It was actually Kevin Johnson doing most of the damage for Phoenix (including a 46 point game in game 7) and was the best player in the series. In the end, Houston vanquished them, beating them in 7 and coming back from a 3-1 deficit to do it. 

The Western Conference Finals were the 6th seeded Houston Rockets against the 1st seeded 62-20 San Antonio Spurs. Hakeem vs The Admiral was an obvious dream mathcup for the WCF, but it wasn't that close of a matchup. Hakeem outperformed the MVP quite handily, averaging 35/13/5/1/4 on 59% TS. The Rockets beat the top-seeded Spurs against the league MVP in 6 games to make the NBA Finals again.

The Finals were against Shaquille O'Neal's Orlando Magic who were the 1st seed in the east with a 59-23 record. It becomes a 2v2 matchup between Hakeem and Clyde vs Shaq and Anfernee Hardaway. All four players have excellent playoff series, but it ultimately doesn't matter as the Rockets simply sweep the Magic in 4. Hakeem wins Finals MVP against Shaq, avergaing 33/12/6/2/2.

The Rockets finished as the 6th seed and won on-the-road playoff series against all four literal best teams in the league, playing against four MVP calibre players, pushing every western conference round to the edge to do so. 

I feel like this should be considered an all-time great run and I think it gets overlooked a bit in the big picture.",nbadiscussion
1006,11,Soft Calls will wreck the NBA,"As a big fan of the game I have been looking forward to watching notable match-ups in the first round of the Playoffs. Kawhi VS Luka, LeBron VS Lillard etc. I believe that the referees are calling fouls way too soft for no apparent reason. I understand they are human, and this is not an attack, but I think that some of the weak fouls being called at the moment could have a big impact on Playoff results and the NBA's ratings. Its just not fun to watch.

Porzingis' cheap ejection for example. The refereeing right now is impacting games in many ways:

* hard defense cannot be played for a reasonable duration without fouls being called which is leading to low quality defence - higher scoring games
* in many games ive watched, there wouldn't be more than 10 seconds of play without a call
* game lengths are dragging on with the excessive free throws being shot
* players points aren't a true resemblance of the game - for anyone just reading points, Anthony Davis' 28pts sounds pretty decent - but he only shot 33% from the field, getting 17 free throw attempts (some were fair but many were super soft)
* the excitement of play is staggered and its hard to get into the competitive mood when its just watching a free throw shoot out
* player flopping is getting even worse 

The start of the Lakers Blazers game today was exciting because the refs were letting some contact go, and players (LeBron) actually had decent contact on layups. Because of this, players scoring points was quite impressive as they had to finish through contact, rather than just getting bailed out by the refs. These are grown men, who are apart of the most athletic and strongest athletes in sport, the NBA needs to reconsider its officiating so that we as fans can enjoy high quality, competitive games that don't stop every 15 seconds. 

This is what I have taken from the playoffs so far. I would love to hear your thoughts on this.",nbadiscussion

1008,13,Simmons would be an amazing fit for Minnesota and they should be trying to trade the #1 pick and other assets to get him,"Offensively, Simmons + KAT is far more terrifying than Simmons + Embiid. The Wolves could run a 5 out offense, which is where Simmons is at his absolute best. Simmons would dominate in transition. The Wolves could run a fast paced 5 out offense the way the Sixers did when Embiid was injured during Simmons’ rookie year and they went on a 15 game winning streak. 

In the half court, they have tons of options with that core. Simmons lack of shooting isn’t a concern when KAT can spot up and they can run the DLo-Simmons PnR with great effectiveness. They have multiple options who can score in half court, with DLo being able to create his own shot effectively and KAT being elite both in the post and on the perimeter. 
Even Simmons would destroy teams in this half court offense. They could clear out KAT and DLo and have Simmons go to work. He’d blow by slower players and eat up smaller guards in the post. 

I’ve always said that Simmons doesn’t need a jumper to dominate, and Russ’s success this year only proves that. If Simmons developed a post game and learned how to use his physical tools to consistently dominate smaller defenders 1-on-1, he could legitimately be a top 5 player in such an offense given his elite 2-way impact. 

Simmons is also a DPOY-tier perimeter defender, which would be huge for this team. If they drafted Edwards or LaMelo instead, their defense would probably be complete garbage.  Simmons gives them an elite defender who can guard 1-4 and even some 5s in today’s NBA. With his versatility, they could have him guard 4s and play DLo/Okogie/Beasley/Simmons/KAT. They’d have a young team that would tear up teams on offense while holding their own on defense. 

His age also fits this team better than a lotto pick would. He’s a young star entering his prime, just like DLo and KAT. Hes not going to need a year or two to develop and hit his stride. 

Also, this draft is very tricky; the Wolves have an inexperienced FO and the franchise has a history of making terrible choices in the draft. Edwards could easily be Wiggins 2.0 with the questions about his motor. LaMelo could never hit his defensive potential. There’s tons of questions surrounding these other players. This isn’t a particularly strong draft with a clear #1 either. If the Wolves could take a Simmons clone with the #1 pick, they’d more than happily do it - why not exchange the pick for Simmons instead?

One issue is whether or not the Sixers would be as enthusiastic about such a trade. Embiid is in his prime, and bringing in a rookie that needs years to develop or potentially bust could end up wasting Embiid’s prime years when he should be contending. I think the more likely scenario for this exchange is if they do a **3-way trade** with a team like the Wizards. 

**Example: (trade would likely also include other pieces, this is just the backbone)**

*Wolves receive*: Ben Simmons

*Wizards receive*: #1 pick + other assets

*Philly receives*: Bradley Beal

**Why would each team do this?**

Minnesota gets a **2-way star who fits perfectly with DLo and KAT**. I’ve already explained why in the rest of this post. 

The Wizards could **rebuild completely with the #1 and #9 pick**. [Tommy Sheppard has talked about trading up using their #9 and #37 pick](https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/idqp1g/hughes_gm_tommy_sheppard_mentions_possibly/), so it sounds like they want a big prospect this year. I know they said they want to keep Beal, but we all know that means nothing in today’s NBA. Even if Wall comes back somewhat healthy and Beal continues to produce at a high level, this is a 4-5 seed in the East at best and they’d have zero shot at a title. Why not start from scratch with multiple young prospects instead? For example, LaMelo could come in and play in a fast-paced offense with multiple weapons while learning from an elite distributor in Wall. He’d have elite spacing with guys like Bertans, and has a serviceable big in Bryant. 

Philly gets a **young offensive star who fits better with Embiid**. Beal is still young and can compete with Embiid while still being part of Philly’s core for the future. The only issue I see here is that Philly would want a distributor to set up both of these guys. If the Thunder gets swiftly knocked out of the playoffs and decide to sell high, Philly could trade Horford + picks/assets for CP3, giving them a lineup of **CP3/Beal/Richardson/Harris/Embiid**. They would be immediate contenders, and if the rest of their team ages they’ll still have prime Beal/Embiid for another 3-4 years.",nbadiscussion

1010,15,"CP3 was a perfect fit for Morey Ball, Russ is better fit for D'Antoni ball.","IMO when people talk about how good a fit CP3 was in Houston and Russ won't be the same, they're missing the important fact that the offense changed completely with CP3 there. They went from one of the fastest teams in the league for most of D'Antoni's early tenure to at one point the second slowest team in the league after the 2018 all star break. And D'Antoni wasnt even necessarily happy about it:
  
  
“We’d like to play a little faster,” D’Antoni said. “We’ll talk about it. We need to get it up there. We’re turning into a defensive team and it’s really ticking me off.
  
“I can’t speed them up. Every great player has his own speed. That’s how we play.  We try to inch it up a little bit, but Chris Paul is going to play like Chris Paul. He’s a Hall of Fame player. Why change it? James is going to be James. There’ll be times where we push it and times when we don’t. You just get a feel for how you want to play and you do it.”
  
So basically there D'Antoni is admitting that the CP3 era wasnt how he wanted to play, but he went with it to placate Chris. In terms of what we saw the last two years, yes, Chris is an infinitely better fit. The constant isos were something Chris was a master at. But the original D'Antoni system is about getting downhill and then kicking out if the defense collapses. The PnR spam version of the D'Antoni offense is perfect for Russ, the ISO Morey version we got the last two years is not. 
  
Also, in terms of the difference it shooting, while clear that Paul is miles better, D'Antoni's offense has always had negative shooters that they still asked to shoot. A guy like Shawn Marion shot way below league average every year. D'Antoni will have to help Russell with shot selection but it's not a requirement that you be a knock-out shooter. IMO for D'Antoni's system, Russ' skillset works as a guy with the athleticism to catch lobs, run in transition while also being able to make every angle pass on the PnR. It really just comes down to buy in on his part to get rid of the bad habits and move as the system requires. But every when we talk about Paul ""fitting into D'Antoni's system"", he really didn't. D'Antoni just changed the system to fit him instead.",nbadiscussion
1011,16,"Michael Jordan's ""The Shot"" (May 7, 1989) was the only buzzer-beater ever that ended a series AND if it had missed would have ended the series the other way","The first-round series in 1989 between the 3-seeded Cavs and 6-seeded Bulls was supposed to be an easy Cleveland win. They swept Chicago 6-0 during the regular season, and they were considered a *team* while the Bulls were still just MJ and 4 guys who had an up-close seat to watch him score 40. 

Well the first 4 games were all tight, and the winner flip-flopped each one, starting with Chicago ([series scores & stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/1989-nba-eastern-conference-first-round-bulls-vs-cavaliers.html)). Game 5 was the final game since that's how long first-round series went back then, and it was the tightest one yet. Cleveland held a slim lead through 3-and-a-half quarters, but the Bulls fought back in the 4th to take the lead with a few minutes left, and then the two teams traded 1-point leads multiple times in the last 2 minutes ([video of the last few minutes - well worth watching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g2z1dLzTcM)), including a Jordan pull-up jumper with 6 seconds left to go up 99-98, then Craig Ehlo downing an acrobatic drive with 3 seconds left to re-take the lead for the Cavs 100-99. The home Cleveland crowd went wild. And then....

You already know what took place next, and I can't explain it better than it happened. After a timeout to get the ball at halfcourt, Jordan hit ""The Shot"" over an out-stretched, twisting Ehlo. The Bulls won, and eventually went all the way to the ECF where they lost to the Pistons, but it finally let fans know the Bulls could win. 

But the most-noteworthy part of the shot that you almost never hear is that it made this **THE ONLY SERIES TO EVER END ON A MADE BUZZER BEATER THAT WOULD HAVE ENDED THE OTHER WAY WITH A MISS.** It was ALL riding on that last shot. It goes in & the Bulls *immediately win the series*. It misses & the Cavs *immediately win the series*. No overtime, no split seconds left on the clock for a final attempt, no next game, no nothing. It went in, making this the only true all-or-nothing buzzer beater in NBA playoffs history.",nbadiscussion

1014,19,Let’s talk about Jimmy Butler,"I just read an article on the Athletic, and it ended with if the heat manage to win 4 more games Butler will never be questioned again. The point of this article was saying that Jimmy Butler has been right about every franchise he’s been apart of in the past, and all that s*it he caused along the way to Miami. All I can think is that the bulls have been bad since he left, the wolves are a “punchline” again once Butler left, and that Philly isn’t as competitive without Jimmy, and now he’s headed to the nba finals with arguably his least star studded team. So why should we question Jimmy at all?

Edit 1: 1st. I do need to make it clear I was just quoting an article up there, That wasn’t my actual Jimmy Take.
2nd. Thanks for some of the awards it’s really cool.
3rd. My personal take on Jimmy Butler is I see him as the worst superstar, because he has a tremendous impact on the court like a Lebron James but to a LESSER DEGREE, just had to make it very clear he doesn’t have the exact same impact. But I mean this year Jimmy Only averaged 19.9ppg 6.7rpg and 6.0apg, which is a stat line you would not think a superstar would average, but there’s things that he does that doesn’t show up on the box score and I think it was game 2 of the ECF where he poked the ball loose from Jaylen Brown then had the saving it from out of bounds pass to Tyler Herro, he just all hustle all the time.

1015,20,"Kawhi Leonard signs with the Los Angeles Clippers; Paul George traded to the Clippers for Gallinari/SGA/many picks. Earth-shaking ramifications for the Clippers, Lakers, and Raptors.","**Raptors**

This has the simultaneous effect of weakening the Raptors and the Lakers. With the Raptors losing both Kawhi and Danny Green and replacing them with no one, along with the further aging of their already old core (Lowry, Gasol, Ibaka), I personally see them having a tough time getting through Giannis next year, barring an incredible leap from Siakam. He's already made numerous leaps forward, so it wouldn't be a great surprise, but the Bucks and the 76ers are quite formidable next year. This is still a quality team, but I foresee them descending in the playoff pack to hang out with the new-look Celtics and the Nets (sans Durant). I hope they prove me wrong.

Note: Weakening the Raptors means the East is now more of a two-horse race (Bucks/76ers) than last season and their road just got easier.

**Lakers**

Of course, this also brings us back to the Lakers. LeBron and AD aren't getting that third max player they wanted. With all the talk about it potentially being Kemba (who was linked to Boston almost immediately), Kyrie (nope), Paul George all the way back a season ago, and obviously, Kawhi, surely the Lakers are disappointed they struck out here. Now they'll have to spend $32M on free agents who evidently won't be worth as much as Kawhi would have meant to the team. Since the Clippers are now out of cap, the Lakers are pretty much the only team left with money to throw around. Danny Green, Marcus Morris, KCP, Rondo, McGee, and others should be snapped up pretty soon, assuming they accept those offers. ([A few other teams have some cap left](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/cap/), like Hawks, Knicks, Suns, Pacers, but not in any quantity near what the Lakers can offer. Also doesn't include available exceptions.)

Pickings are slim now that free agency has gone on for so long, but they took a risk and it didn't work out. Shit happens, and Kawhi has shown us that he is a player worth waiting for. That said, they still have LeBron and AD, who can make something happen. Surround LeBron with shooters, let AD do his thing, and there's sufficient reason to expect success for that roster.

**Clippers**

As for the Cliippers, they still have a decent group of players post-trade, since they gave up their future capital to the Thunder. Gallinari was probably mostly to match salaries, and I'm sure the Thunder are excited about SGA, but four unprotected first-rounders is wild.  They now have three defensive powerhouses in Patrick Beverley, Kawhi, and PG13, to go with Shamet, 6MOTY Lou, ""6MOTY x2"" Trez, Zubac, and others. That's a rotation that I'm comfortable with at least six players deep in the playoffs, and I might trust Zubac, McGruder, and Harkless to play enough defense to let Kawhi and PG13 do most of the offensive work. They have a couple of roster spots that need filling (11 players for now), so they should also be in play for a few of the free agents available, though they will be capped out. They have yet to use their room exception, so I would expect to see that soon.

Note: The Gallinari ($22.6M) + SGA ($3.95M) salaries BARELY matched with PG's $33M.

Note 2: All the stealth tampering done by the Clippers during the season was certainly super sketchy and shouldn't be forgotten in the wake of this signing.

------------------

**The Wild Wild West** 

To most of us I'm sure, these acquisitions automatically vault the Clippers into championship contention. The West was already simultaneously wide open and a bloodbath, and this just makes it even harder for the other teams in the West. Teams that moved into win-now mode (e.g. Lakers, Jazz) now have to deal with a second team that features multiple top 10 players (as if the Warriors weren't already enough last year) and has more players than the Lakers. (Only saying that because it's hard to make a full evaluation of the Lakers roster if Jared Dudley is their 4th player.

It seemed to be pretty universally agreed upon that there were 5 clear playoff teams in the West (Warriors, Lakers, Nuggets, Jazz, Trail Blazers, and Rockets) and Clippers makes a 6th, while weakening another possible playoff team in OKC. This will create an interesting race for the 7th and 8th seeds, though those teams will have the unfortunate circumstance of going against a strong contender. Virtually every other team not yet named will be going for those spots.

----------------

**Thunder**

Of course, this discussion wouldn't be complete without the Thunder. Reports said that PG demanded out once recruited by Kawhi. This after a 49-33 season with the Thunder that ended in a 5 game loss to the Trail Blazers in the playoff. That said, the Thunder had some staggering contracts to deal with (Westbrook, PG, Adams, Schroder, etc.) and had no upward mobility. They were destined for ~50-win seasons (but early playoff exits) for the foreseeable future. 

This move makes it so that the Thunder move directly into a graceful rebuild. Getting two first-rounders every year gives the franchise that drafted Westbrook, Durant, and Harden ([among others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder_draft_history)) multiple shots at getting quality players on cheap contracts. If they can unload their other bad contracts as those become expirings (most come off the books by 2021, including the recently acquired Gallinari's), they'll have a really young team full of guys on rookie contracts. 

They will definitely be mediocre to bad for a little while, but I think considering their cap situation, this type of move was going to be inevitable. It was either going to be hold on to your max guys and wait until 2021 for Schroder and Adams to come off the books before you get some cap relief, or make the move and see what happens. Getting Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was nice, though. He looked a little uncomfortable at the beginning of the season, but he showed up in the playoffs and his ceiling is really high, given his height/length/skills.

1016,21,The refs have way too much influence on how games turn out compared to other sports.,"Seriously. Part of the reason the Raptors - Celtics OT was so good is because of the 3 or 4 possessions where they were trading shots with no whistles blown. It was so refreshing not to hear the whistle and have the game momentum stopped and have them bitch to the refs and have them go to the line for shots. The last minute of a close game is usually always decided with a ref's decision (drawing fouls, flopping, etc.).

Now compare that to other sports. Soccer used to be easily influenced by refs due to questionable penalties but now that they have VAR so whenever a challenge in the box is debatable they usually just go check the VAR. And they do this as many times as needed in a single game because unlike in the NBA, soccer coaches don't have challenges because the refs know to check VAR. For example in game 2 (I think) when Smart ran into Siakam and flopped in the first half, refs called a foul on Siakam and Nurse had to challenge it. Oops looks like there goes Nurse's challenge due to ref incompetence, and when a refs call in the last 2 minutes of the game can decide everything that's a huge disadvantage for the Raptors just because they missed a flop.

It's frustrating how they can barely go 2 possessions in a row without a foul call or the ref blowing the whistle and stopping the game momentum. I know fouls are a big part of the game but it's ridiculous to me, like why even contest a shot anymore if 90% of the time it's going to end in a foul because you lightly brushed the shooters elbow after the shot?

Do you think the NBA should change the game somehow? Make it harder to foul someone? It's silly to me that in hockey you glide around with knives on your feet and check the shit out of people and literally fight but in the NBA if you barely touch someone the wrong way it's a foul.",nbadiscussion

1024,29,I can’t help but to feel like the coverage of whether LeBron James was or was not in attendance of the Kobe Bryant Memorial is a new low in the era of tabloid-esque NBA coverage. Does anyone else think this has gone too far?,"I can’t help but to feel like the coverage of whether LeBron James was or was not in attendance of the Kobe Bryant Memorial is a new low in the era of tabloid-esque NBA coverage. Does anyone else think this has gone too far?

It feels like this story straight out of one of those crappy magazines that they sell at the counters of a supermarket. Like why are legitimate NBA reporters in analysis trying to make a story out of this? Even Skip Bayless, who certainly can be trash at times, should know way better than this.

When a story like this still gets this crazy amount of attention that it has, it makes me think that the NBA media is not trying to sell a sports product but a more soap opera drama type product, which gives me some major concerns about the future of the league.

Does anyone else feel this way??? Am I alone in my overreaction? I just feel like we are really losing sight of the joys of what happens on the court and instead really trying to get some salacious drama for cheap thrills",nbadiscussion
1025,30,So... What's DeMar DeRozan been up to lately?,"We've always known him as Toronto's beloved midrange-happy All-Star guard/forward who shares Ben Simmons's aversion to the 3-point shot, but since the fateful 2018 Kawhi Leonard trade that sent him to San Antonio, DeMar DeRozan has faded from the spotlight somewhat as the Spurs now face an annual struggle to make the playoffs in a brutal Western Conference. 

**So, how's he been faring in his second year donning the black and silver?**

- - - 

**1)** The first thing you probably notice about 2020 DeMar DeRozan is that this is easily the ***most efficient version*** of him we've ever seen - he's averaged **23.3 points and 5.9 assists per 75** on 53% shooting from the field and **60 TS%**, 3.3 points higher than league-average efficiency (i.e. **+3.3 rTS%**). His previous most efficient volume-scoring output was in 2015-16, where he scored 25.3 points per 75 on +0.9 efficiency (55 TS%). 

DeMar's shooting percentage at the rim has been incredible for his position - **[70.7 FG% in the restricted area](https://stats.nba.com/player/201942/shooting/)**, which is similar at-rim efficiency to someone like LeBron James (69 FG%) or Anthony Davis (73 FG%) - on far fewer attempts, of course, but still highly impressive.

---

**2)** The second thing you might is that ***this season has been a tale of two DeMars***. Including and prior to 12-22-2019, a 25-point loss to the Clippers, DeRozan averaged 20.7 points and 4.7 assists on 56 TS% (-0.4 rTS%). *Since that date, over 33 games, he's averaged 23.4 points and 6.3 assists on blistering hot efficiency, 55/27/87 splits, or 63 TS% (+6.3 rTS%)*. As a result, DeMar DeRozan now holds the record for the [**longest streak of 20+ points and >50 FG% by guards in NBA history**](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/eqbirf/demar_derozan_holds_the_record_for_longest_streak/). Cool stuff! 

- This wasn't a random change, though. [Coach Pop made two key changes after that horrific Clippers loss](https://www.spurstalk.com/demar-derozan-san-antonio-spurs-cracked-code/). First, he **moved DeMar to Power Forward**, to reduce Rudy Gay's playing time and veer away from having LaMarcus Aldridge and non-shooting center Jakob Poeltl share the court, to try and improve spacing. Second, he **moved LMA to the 3-point line and implored LMA to shart shooting 3s.** 

- The effect was near-instantaneous - all of a sudden, with LMA bombing away from 3 (4.2 3PA, 42 3P% in 23 games since 12/23/19), DeRozan has had more driving lanes to work with, abusing more mismatches and drawing more fouls (5.8➡️7.3 FTA/G), having more midrange real-estate to find clearer looks and also finishing more cleanly at the rim (49.9➡️55.0 FG%), and attracting more defensive attention as a result to facilitate the Spurs offense (4.7➡️6.3 assists/game). **The Spurs are once again a decent overall offensive unit (111.9 ORTG, +1.5 rORTG).**

---

**3)** The third thing you might realize is that ***DeMar is still a mediocre defender***. The Spurs are a [**whopping 5.9 points better on defense with DeMar off the court**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/derozde01/on-off/2020), and most available defensive metrics available all paint DeMar as a bottom 10th-15th percentile defender - D-PIPM (17th-worst), D-RAPM (449th), D-RAPTOR (226th out of 250), D-RPM (469th). He consistently ranks near the bottom of the league in [hustle stats](https://stats.nba.com/players/hustle/?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*DeMar%20DeRozan&Season=2019-20&SeasonType=Regular%20Season), is terrible at fighting over screens, is a non-factor in transition defense (he has a penchant for complaining over missed calls), is inconsistent in closing out to shooters, strikes out when gambling for steals, has questionable decision-making and often finds himself a step or two behind opponent plays, stuck in no-mans-land, making him a poor team defender. 

For some **positives**: He's not terrible at man defense, and the move to power forward [actually helped his defense somewhat](http://www.82games.com/1920/19SAS9.HTM#bypos), as opponent PFs only have a 15.1 PER (around league average) when facing DeRozan, whereas opponent SFs have an excellent 19.7 PER with DeMar as the primary defender (PER is an objectively terrible stat, but it at least broadly captures player performance so you'll forgive its use here). 

**Now, not all of San Antonio's defensive woes can be attributed to DeMar. The team as a whole is ranked 25th in defense, with a -3.3 rDRTG, and objectively poor overall defense like this is a systemic issue rather than due to any single player.**  

The Spurs are in a **constant state of defensive flux** - a dearth of shooting forces Popovich to often play proven floor-spacer but **absolute defensive sieve Bryn Forbes**, while inconsistent shooting and offensive production limit perhaps the Spurs' best all-round defender, Dejounte Murray's, court time. A lack of spacing also stops excellent rim protector Jakob Poeltl from earning consistent minutes as lineups pairing him and LMA have been subpar on offense. 

---

**4)** The fourth and final thing, perhaps, is that the ***situation in San Antonio is very tenuous*** for both DeMar and the team alike. The tireless Spurs machine is currently stuck between eras, trying to churn out winning seasons and maintain their streak of 22 consecutive playoff appearances by playing veterans like DeMar, LMA, and Gay significant minutes, while simultaneously trying to develop younger promising players like Murray, White, Lonnie Walker, Lyles, and Poeltl. This has, understandably, yielded mixed results this season, because of spacing issues and more importantly, inconsistent defense. Meanwhile, DeMar is on the wrong side of 30 and has a possible contract extension looming ($150M, 4 years, if I'm not mistaken). Some fans say he'll leave, while others say a potential cap-drop resulting from COVID-19 could convince him to opt-in. Either way, this season is a turning point of sorts, for both the San Antonio Spurs and for DeMar DeRozan.",nbadiscussion
1026,31,"Over the past 50 years, almost 90% of NBA championship teams had at least one all-NBA defender.","The all-NBA defensive teams started with the 1968-69 season. Since then only 6 teams have won a title without an all-NBA defender from that season:

|Year|Champion|Best Defender|
:--|:--|:--|
|2016|Cleveland Cavaliers|LeBron James|
|2006|Miami Heat|Alonzo Mourning*|
|1995|Houston Rockets|Hakeem Olajuwon*|
|1981|Boston Celtics|Robert Parish|
|1978|Washington Bullets|Elvin Hayes|
|1975|Golden State Warriors|Jamaal Wilkes|

*Hakeem was 3rd in DPOY voting in '95 and Mourning was 8th in '06

You'll notice that even these 6 teams had at least one superb defender with all of these players except for Parish having been an all-NBA defender at some point in their career. If you count the Rockets and Heat as having an all-NBA defender when they won the title (both had top 10 defenders that season at a stacked position), then 47 out of the past 51 champions (92%) have had an all-NBA defender on their team.",nbadiscussion
1027,32,How LeBron James Ruined My Life: Revisiting the 2006 Playoff Match-up Between Cleveland and Washington,"A lot of people don’t realize this — Washington fans hated LeBron James first. Before he would take his talents to South Beach, before he would vibe out to *California Love*, before he would breathe and ESPN would have a 20-minute analysis regarding it, he was the kid from Ohio attempting to bring glory to Cleveland. Despite the world understanding his greatness, there was still skepticism. His first play-off series would have to wait until 2006.  


Dan Gilbert, seeing the opportunity he had with LeBron James, had to make changes. He would bring on a new general manager and new head coach—Danny Ferry and Mike Brown. The team would also bring in Larry Hughes, Zydrunas Ilgauskas into the thick of things that would help provide support for the young superstar. 


LeBron James would have his best points-per-game season that would last his entire career—scoring 31.4 points per game on 23.1 field goals per game and 10.3 free throw attempts. Big Z and Anderson Varejao would split minutes at the 5 and were critical in spacing the paint—or crowded the paint and simply out-manning their opponents for rebounds. Ronald Murray and Larry Hughes would provide spacing and Eric Snow would pass the ball to LeBron.


This was the year where it felt like the world was bracing itself for LeBron to introduce himself as a force to be reckoned with. They would finish with a record of 50-32, finish 2nd in the central division. They would have the 5th highest attendance. It was showtime.


LeBron’s first play-off opponent would be against the Washington Wizards. The three of Gilbert Arenas, Antawn Jamison and Caron Butler would attempt to utilize the Eddie Jordan Princeton Offense. Not only did the style not take advantage of the talent on that team, it limited its star player—who would effectively not abide by the system’s principles and do his own him. Yet, it got them to a 5th seed in the play-offs in a weak conference.


Truly, everyone was ready for the spectacle that would be LeBron versus Gilbert. In the previous season, Arenas wasn’t the man we all knew and loved — he would split opportunities with Jamison, Larry Hughes. Now, it was different. He wanted to make a point. 


The regular season went 3-1 in the favor of Washington. The only game that went into the favor of Cleveland was their first match-up—an emotional game for Larry Hughes who left the franchise the summer prior because Washington low-balled him on a contract. Gilbert would have an off-night after putting up 34 on San Antonio the game prior. Washington would win the next 3 — two of which, featured poor performances from James and the final game being James’ first game back from injury. 


Analysts would predict Cleveland to win the series easy but there were still some concerns. *We hadn't seen LeBron on the biggest stage, he was good but his team wasn't.*
---


Game 1 would take place in Cleveland. We would see the signature powder toss to start the game, the crowd was excited to see play-off basketball for the first time in sometime. And more importantly, it was a must-win game to set the tone for the series. 


Eddie Jordan would come out of the gates with a 2-3 zone however it would not stop LeBron. LeBron would have 13 points, 4 assists and 3 rebounds in the first quarter. Like Fury coming out strong against Wilder, it wasn’t expected that LeBron could keep up the pace against the zone and, more importantly, Gilbert wouldn’t allow it to happen. But the Wizards wouldn’t make an appearance until the fourth quarter and by then, it was too late. 


LeBron James would record a triple-double in his first play-off game and the Cave would take Game 1 with ease.


Game 2, suddenly became a must win game for the Washington Wizards. 


The Wizards again, would have a slow start but fortunately, so did LeBron James. Drew Gooden’s impact on the boards would account for 8 points, LeBron James would have 11 to start the game but the team would only be up two. Caron Butler would bail out the slumping Antawn Jamison, going 5 for 9 from the field, accounting for 10 1st quarter points and keeping the game at least close. The combo of Gilbert and Caron would keep the Wizards afloat—going on a 22-to-2 run just by themselves during the 1st half.


As time ticked and the close remained extremely close, LeBron James’s inexperience would show. His 10 turnovers—6 in the second half—were free points for a Gilbert Arenas that seemingly wouldn’t let the team lose. Antawn Jamison would score 19 points in the second half—21 for the night—finally making an appearance in the play-offs.


And then Caron Butler fouled out. An eight point lead that felt like it would seal the game didn’t matter.

With 19.6 seconds left, the Wizards would only have a 3-point lead. But Butler’s substitution—Billy Thomas—would have a chance to seal the deal at the line. Of course he didn’t seal the deal, it wouldn’t make for good television or a good story. And of course, LeBron James got the rebound. 


He would lead the ball up the court down three. Varejao would set a high screen but Jamison would provide the help defense to stop the potential shot. Instead, it would lead to Anderson rolling and seemingly have an open quick bucket in the paint, only to be ruined by Agent Zero poking it out of his hands to save the game. 


Gilbert wasn’t losing Game 2. 


Eddie Jordan slowly made adjustments to the Wizards offense with the realization that the Princeton Offense was not working. The floor became slowly more spread out and Gilbert would see a lot more isolation opportunities. Meanwhile, Mike Brown didn’t do sh** because why would he? He had LeBron James.


Washington would start off their first home game hot and more importantly, LeBron James wouldn’t. Once again Caron Butler would start the game off strong going 4-for-6 from the field and surprisingly, Antawn Jamison wouldn’t suck to start a game. The 26-19 lead to start the first quarter, LeBron James possibly falling under the pressure of play-offs, it felt like the story most expected.


LeBron would proceed to score 16 points in the second quarter only to be matched by four Wizards scoring 21 points. LeBron was roaring but the Wizards were keeping a safe distance. And 8 point lead felt like enough. 


Caron Butler returning to earth in the 3rd quarter didn’t help. 2-for-8 from the field was not good. More importantly, Brendan Haywood would rack-up 3 fouls and Eddie Jordan would push Jamison to the five. A total of  34 points would be scored in the third quarter and the game would be tied. [LeBron would also have a ridiculous pass that I still don’t know how he was able to pull it off](https://youtu.be/RpiMtLxh7NA?t=360). Also, Big Z travelled on that play and it doesn't get talked about enough. 


The 4th quarter would feature the match-up we all were expecting — Gilbert versus LeBron. Eddie Jordan’s shift to a man defense wasn’t much of a basketball decision as it was a respect decision. Mike Brown, still didn’t do sh** to adjust. 


For the next 12 minutes, no one else on the court seemed to matter. The Wizards would set-up the half court for Arenas to do his thing, the Cavs would stick to their already spaced system and give the ball to LeBron to do this thing. Arenas’s 17 and LeBron’s 14 points was  battle of greatness that would bring the game down to the wire once again.


The final 45 seconds went like this:


LeBron would bring the ball up and immediately draw Jared Jeffries to the left side of the court. Jeffries would look over his shoulder to realize he was all alone, like he was back in Indiana. Attempting to force LeBron into a help defense situation, he would succeed as LeBron went right. The help defense would come, LeBron would crow step —even though childhood me remembers him pushing off and a travel—and LeBron would finish at the rim.


95-93, Cavs.


Gilbert would get the ball and draw the defense to the right. Pushing the pace, he wanted the quick bucket but more importantly, Anderson Varejao was standing at the top of the key in ’No Man’s Land.’ LeBron would panic to stop the drive, instead committing a blocking foul, and Arenas would get the and-one. 


96-95, Wizards. 23.4 on the clock.


James again would bring up the ball and Jeffries would follow him up the court. Seeing the iso situation once again, Gilbert would fake the threat of a double-team—when in reality, he appeared to have been telling Antonio Daniels, to switch with him. Daniels did not. LeBron would get the high screen and Jeffries would switch with guess who, Antonio Daniels. 


Drive down the middle, fake left, Daniels eats the pum, go right, Michael Ruffin cannot defend. It doesn’t get easier. 


97-96, LeBron. 


With 5.7 seconds left, an actual brilliant play was drawn up by Jordan and staff. Gilbert would take out the ball. Jeffries would start from the low post but flash to the wing. Gilbert would inbounds and based off the situation—could wrap around to the basket for a contested lay-up or pop out for the jumper. Hughes would stumble attempting to guard Arenas and Agent Zero had the look outside. All of the space in the world, feet set, it would lip out. Jamison would fight for the rebound but couldn’t get it. 


It wasn’t a good start to the weekend.


Game 4 was once again a must-win game for Washington. Gilbert didn't help—starting 1-for-9 in the first half. Down 57 to 46 in the first half, things needed to change. Arenas would change his outfit—literally his shoes, shirt, jersey, shorts, tights—and Eddie Jordan simply said that he would not call any plays and just let his players play. 


It worked.


The Wizards would outscore Cleveland 60 to 39 in the second half. LeBron would have 7 turnovers, 4 offensive fouls and complain about the officiating post-game, commenting on how he felt his aggressive play was being taken away. What he didn’t know was Eddie Jordan had spoken to the refs about LeBron’s aggressiveness during the off-day. 


LeBron would have his first frustrated play-off experience with his team, as they would be unable to take advantage of the Wizards crowding LeBron on defense. Gilbert's 28 points in the second half, 20 points in the 4th quarter would bring the series even but the wraith of LeBron James was coming.


And Gilbert was still Gilbert, quoting the infamous Nike ads in post-game interviews: “This is LeBron's show, you know. We're just all witnesses.”


Returning back to Cleveland, everyone knew a war was coming. Whoever would win this game would more than likely win the series. And of course, it would have to go to overtime.


Arenas and James were matching each other bucket for bucket. When it wasn’t in their hands, you f**ked up as a teammate. With 33 seconds left in overtime, Arenas would strip the ball from Larry Hughes and get to the basket for a contested yet an easy lay-up, giving the Wizards a 1 point lead. With 30 seconds left, LeBron would bring the ball-up the court, this time on the right side, and while attempting to push by Caron Butler, he would draw the blocking foul. 


No one wanted LeBron on the line in the final seconds. Winning by free throws was bogus. He would hit both of them, one point lead in their favor.


Arenas’s turn, he would draw Hughes as far from the perimeter as possible, searching for the opportunity to trip off Hughes once again. Hitting him with a crossover and seeing an opportunity to go left, Arenas brought him to the paint only for Varejao to step in for a blocking foul.


No one wanted the game to end by free throws. Wizards go up 1 with 3.6 seconds left.


It wouldn’t end by free throws.


[LeBron James would would get the ball baseline](https://youtu.be/O_VRySsuR9E?t=63). The Wizards immediately collapse on the 21 year-old. They knew he would take the shot. Some how managing to push around Jamison and stay in bounds, he would lay it in.


“The Lay-Up."" 


Arenas’s 44 didn’t matter, Antawn’s quiet 32 didn’t matter. LeBron had 45 and the only bucket that mattered. 


Back to Washington, Gilbert and LeBron were ready for one final duel. Walking into the arena strapped, Arenas and Caron Butler would match Cleveland’s total for the first quarter while others accounted for 7 additional points. Donyell Marshall and LeBron James would respond with 18 points in the second, leading reducing their deficit to 1 entering the half. 


Despite a cold third quarter from LeBron and Larry Hughes,  27 points from both teams in the third quarter would set the table for the 4th quarter match-up we were all expecting: Flip Murray and Donnell Marshall versus Antonio Daniels and others. 


Yet during the 2 minutes of the fourth, the broadcast would return to its expected program of LeBron and Gilbert fighting to the death. 


1:35 to go, Wizards up 4.


LeBron gets Gilbert Arenas into an isolation match-up on the left side of the court. Gilbert, being the elite defender that he is, fails to make LeBron go right following a jab-step and LeBron gets the easy 2 over the smaller defender.


Missed free throws from Jeffries, missed lay-up from Butler, Antawn getting blocked were met by  Ronald Murray 4 points in two possessions, along with trading free throws and Eric snow making free throws to give the Cavs a 3 point lead with 5 seconds to go.


With the ball in their half court, everyone knew Gilbert was getting the ball. [No one was expecting him to get the ball 28-feet away from the basket and drilling it](https://youtu.be/DgVM5VOWozM?t=420). 


There would only be 13 points made in overtime: 5 points from LeBron James, 4 from Caron Butler, 2 from Gilbert Arenas.


With the Wizards holding a one-point lead and 15.1 seconds left, the Cavs had to foul. They would have to foul Gilbert Arenas. Gilbert had already missed two free throws this game but was having a reality nice night — 36 points, 51.9% from the field, 11 assists. An 80.3% free throw percentage and the mindset of a Greek God, he would make this a three point game…Right?


[He would miss the first one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nfeSlgjKSw). Short. A common practice of Arenas and of those that get little movement from the legs in their form.


LeBron James would approach him, tapping his left shoulder as he prepared his routine. Arenas looked surprised—surprised that the young star would do this or surprised that the refs let this happen. LeBron would mutter the words that would shake his mental, something along the lines of, “If you miss this, you’re going home.” He would miss his second free throw.


The Wizards would still be up one with 14.6 seconds to go. Gilbert would pick-up LeBron but LeBron wouldn’t be the one to take the final shot. One pass to Hughes, one pass to Damon Jones, alone in the corner. He would make the final 2 points of that game. Arenas would push the ball up the court, kick it out to an open Caron Butler but it would not go. 

---

The duel would happen two additional times, making it a back-to-back-to-back match-up in the playoffs— all of which went the Cavs way. The rivalry that was established by Larry Hughes would last because of the battle between two of the best. 


Doing my best Nick Young impression, [LeBron James ruined my life](https://youtu.be/fQwPKlflonQ?t=133). The rivalry that would mold my impression of the King will be remembered as him managing to out-duel the man that loved a good shootout. A rivalry sometimes forgotten by most would shape both teams — how LeBron James would approach his archetypal team and how the Washington Wizards would view building out the team in the next few years, only for it to never come to fruition.",nbadiscussion
1028,33,Kemba Walker Might Have a Shoe Problem,"Last year, I used to have the habit of making the two hour drive from Raleigh to Charlotte to watch the Hornets play basketball on Friday nights. They weren't the best team but were entertaining in a sense. Plus, I got to watch Kemba Walker play. His story in Charlotte was always intriguing -- a franchise guard with the potential to bring the Hornets to new heights never really came to fruition. Now, both parties appear to be on their separate paths to success--Kemba on a championship contender in Boston and the Hornets with a sneaky good young core. 


But Kemba hasn't necessarily been the same player. 


Its kind of weird -- better coaching, better teammates, same opportunities, just not as good. He isn't necessarily hurting the Celtics line-up -- although statistically speaking, they perform marginally worse with him in the line-up. He's scoring 5 less points per game on 5 less attempts, his FG% has dropped a point, he has one less assist per game but his three point percentage has improved and so has his turnover per game. 


There's also one noticeable change he has made -- his shoes. 


Your shoe game on the court matters. [Zion Williamson learned this the hard way when his PG 2.5 broke on national television in his game against North Carolina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqwnpJeXT04&ab_channel=SportsTrending).  Depending on your game or your style, different shoes work for different people. For example, you may not expect a 5'2'' shooting guard that shoots only threes to wear Ewings, an incredibly bulky shoe that provides an incredible amount of ankle support but also can weigh a player down. 


Finding the right shoe can be difficult and creating the right shoe is even harder. For example, a population of players returned to the Kobe Protro line -- a shoe consider to have a lot of 'old school' features with 'new school' shoe technology. Its actually the most popular shoe in the NBA at the moment. Newer releases from Nike have also  generated a lot of player interest-- Giannis' Zoom Freak 1, KD 12, Kyrie 5, PG 3.


But the Jordan brand returned to the fray, releasing the Jordan 34, their latest performance shoe. Its been their most well received performance release in sometime -- gaining respect due to how good the shoe feels. Its the lightest basketball shoe ever created by Jordan yet is still able to provide cushion with Zoom technology. It  has been suggested by users that new technology in the shoe with an eclipse plate plus Zoom cushion combination makes it seem as if you are jumping higher. The shoe has been questioned for the materials used, the fit and the durability but for sponsored athletes, this isn't a problem, because you can just get a new pair for free. 


Its been tagged as a 'shoe for slashers' because of the bounce you get from the shoe. Its great for athletes that want to show off their genetic dominance while also being great for basketball. The shoe has become a staple in the rotations of Williamson, Hachimura, Conley, Tatum and Kemba Walker. 


It is a tad bit interesting that Walker jumped to the shoe, as he was a previous user of the Jordan X -- an incredibly comfortable basketball shoe with a much different traction and material approach. Two completely different shoes. Even if he wasn't wearing the Jordan X, he would rock a Jordan SuperFly 4 -- which was known for really tight traction and solid cushion. 


It impacts you in different ways that you learn to just accept. They have specific traction patterns that even when they wear down, the overall feel remains the same. The comfort remains the same -- you just get used to it. Even when the shoe feels broken into, you still have the technology that impacts your experience.


For Kemba Walker, its impacted his footwork.


Statistically speaking, this is incredibly difficult to track. But we can see changes in certain behaviors. For example, his pull-up jump shot has gone down since joining the Celtics-- going from 44.1%  from the field to 41.8%. His shooting percentage on 'running' shots has also gone down on the Celtics, he's also been taking a lot more running shots compared to his set-foot scoring, which he's statistically performs better at.. In the regular season, he committed 53 shooting fouls in 56 games--compared to his 64 shooting fouls in 82 games last season. And for the first time in his career, he has more turnovers by losing the ball versus committing a turnover via bad pass. And even with these statistics, you could even make the case that the shooting dip is associated with his movement to taking more three point shots--going from 43.4% of his attempts from deep to 53.2%.


So we must turn to the tape. 


[Against the Heat, he's been shuffling his feet a lot more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBZL_E8vUFo&ab_channel=NF) -- an interesting habit for a player that usually relies on straight forward footwork and incredible handles. His precision with his movement has taken a step back and has forced an extra move to regain his composure. Or if he doesn't, and transitions into a shot, he's less likely to make said shot. 


It has also been weird to watch him kick when shooting from deep, something he didn't do as much on the Hornets. The strategy of 'kicking' when taking a jump shot is to balance out the upper body from twisted but when it is simply a jump shot off the dribble, its a reaction to how your feet are set when entering a shot. 


Maybe the biggest concern is how much he's sliding on the defensive end. Its why the amount of fouls he's had is important -- [he's getting beat on the defensive end and has to adjust](https://youtu.be/AV-3_ftNajs?t=121).While historically Kemba Walker has not been a zone guy, his basketball IQ hasn't necessarily been a defensive problem. Kemba has also been changing his shoes more frequently after losses -- a superstitious habit but also one that can affect your performance given how comfortable a shoe can be or how long it can take to break in a shoe. Despite playing in the same model, small differences still appear in the shoes.

 
The overall point is that the move to the Jordan 34 doesn't make sense for the new Kemba Walker. His development into a more perimeter centric guard doesn't align with his decision to wear a shoe meant to improve athletic performances. It also doesn't seem like he's found that comfort even with his shot in his new shoes -- often tinkering with his motions or his kicks to find the right rhythm or feel. There's something holding him back. 


Different strokes work for different folks but it is incredibly interesting to watch his change and his minor regression in his impact on the Celtics, combined with his shoe change. Brad Stevens offense doesn't necessarily create 3-point Point Guards yet Kemba Walker find himself as a different type of guard. A lot of small movement changes and changes in mechanics are starting to catch-up with him and have meant for some questionable moments in the bubble. 


And I can't help but think its with his footwork and his shoes.",nbadiscussion
1029,34,More needs to be said about Jokic's DEFENSE in Game 7,"Jokic's playmaking was incredible. His offensive rebounding was great. But something that hasn't been getting fan fare is just how absurdly good Jokic was ***defensively***. Or more specifcally, how good he was ***at protecting the rim***.

Jokic got 3 blocks. More importantly he prevented easy layups and/or dunks ***7 times***. Those are ***the most valuable*** defensive plays and Jokic essentially gave the rim protection equivalent of 10-14 points scored those plays alone. Anthony Davis would be extremely happy with that kind of production. So would Giannis, but Jokic, whose biggest issue arguably is that he can't protect the rim from a position where rim protection is vital?

&#x200B;

Now, it's dubious whether this holds up to hyper-dominant interior scorers like AD or Giannis whose apex is higher than kawhi or pg, but that said, it was an incredible performance with Jokic being the best defensive player on either team ***by far***. 

Not as important, but it is worth noting jokic made plays on the perimiter, even foiling a couple kawhi drives. Since harris has come back, jokic has looked decent, but that game 7 was an unusally dominant performance and one even top tier rim protectors would be satisfied with. Give credit where credit's due.",nbadiscussion
1030,35,What a typical NBA game plan looks like (full process in comments),,nbadiscussion
1031,36,"CMV: Kyle Lowry should be an all-star starter over Kemba. Despite only averaging 1.7 less points, he averages more rebounds, assists, and steals on a higher TS%. He is also leading the Raptors to a nearly identical record as the Celtics despite having to deal with a slew of injuries.","Kyle Lowry: 20.8/**5.0**/**7.6**/**1.2** on **60.0 TS%**

Kemba Walker: **22.5**/3.9/5.2/0.9 on 58.4 TS%

Lowry is a better defender as well. The Raptors have Siakam, Powell, Gasol, and more injured, but he is still leading the Raptors to multiple wins over .500 teams. Some notable wins include the 30 point comeback vs Dallas and the win yesterday vs Boston where basically all our bigs fouled out. Despite losing Kawhi and Danny Green in the offseason, having our best player injured, and numerous other injuries, the Raptors are still a top 4 seed and only 1 game behind the Celtics.

The Celtics have missed Hayward for part of the season, but Kemba still has a healthy Jaylen Brown, Tatum, etc. Kemba is a great player and should be an All-Star but Lowry has clearly outplayed him this season.

1032,37,“The Last Dance” is not The Last Dance,"I had really high hopes for this documentary when it was teased last summer. I got really excited when the pandemic forced an early release. But since it’s started and we’re near the finish line, I’ve been underwhelmed to put it perfectly. 

We were promised never before seen footage of the last Bulls championship season and a camera crew following that team around. What was left out of commercials and what the majority of the film is actually about is the history of Michael Jordan and the players that surrounded him. We were taken to multiple flashbacks of the 70s and 80s, with episodes talking about how Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, and Phil Jackson came to be. It’s downed Jerry Krause every chance it gets, and you really only get a one-sided perspective unless Reinsdorf is backing him up. 

The majority of episodes have been flashbacks that we’ve seen many times before (Dream Team, Jordan’s “shot”, Jordan’s performance against Boston, baseball, etc). And then you say, “well they’re trying to appeal to the non-basketball fan crowd too”, but you’re also not fulfilling the purpose of the documentary that’s also the title. They’ve skipped around the 1998 season so much because of the flashbacks, that we really don’t have that much more of an understanding than we already had. It’s Jordan being a competitive leader to teammates and that’s honestly it. 

And now tomorrow are the final two episodes. We really don’t have any great insight into that 1998 team because the majority of the documentary was detailing how players/coaches got to Chicago, and to me that’s disappointing. Sure you get all the players and people interviewed, but it’s modern and nothing special.  I expected ten episodes that showed the 98 squad behind the scenes, not detailing flashbacks. But instead we got an oral history of the Bulls and a documentary used to put MJ on a pedestal of his own. 

This show has gotten huge ratings and rave reviews, so my opinion is probably unpopular, but “The Last Dance” didn’t really set out what it was teased to do in my opinion. It wasn’t really about the Last Dance, as much as it was about the history of Michael Jordan and how he influenced his role guys. I’ll take a lot of 30 for 30s over this show.",nbadiscussion

1035,40,The greatness of Bill Russell can be summed up in his last NBA Finals.,"By the '69 Finals, Bill already had 10 rings, but one more couldn't hurt right? The NBA had just created the all-defensive teams, and despite being 34 years old, it wasn't a mistake Russell found himself on the 1st team by season's end. Russell was in his 3rd year as the Celtics head coach, but the team wasn't as dominant as usual, and finished the regular season with a record of 48-34 (Russell's worst career record as a player). 

After winning with relative ease in their first two playoff series, the Celtics faced one of the toughest opponents in Russell's tenure with the team, the Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers had 3 guys you've probably heard of: Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West, and Elgin Baylor. Outside of Russell himself, and Oscar Robertson, the Lakers' trio were the top players of the 60's and Wilt was the only one with a ring. To say this Lakers team was hungry to win is an understatement. 

But that didn't matter for Russell's Celtics. Despite West averaging nearly 38 points per game, Baylor averaging 18/10, and Wilt averaging 11/25, it wasn't enough to win. The Lakers pushed the Celtics to 7 games, and nearly had a 15 point comeback in the 4th quarter, but the Celtics still won. Again.

What did Russell do that series? Well he had already taken a backseat in scoring, so 9.1 points per game wasn't a surprise. He was his dominant self on the boards, averaging 21.1 rebounds per game. For the first time in his career though he was without a HOF PG in Bob Cousy or KC Jones. Russell's response? He led the team in assists during the Finals, and played every minute of the series, refusing to allow Coach Russell to cut into Player Russell's playing time. 

Oh and he won his 11th ring of his career. Enough to have one on every finger, and an extra to keep in his pocket.",nbadiscussion
1036,41,The Defensive 3 Second Rule should be abolished,"It's the last vestige of ""illegal defense"" rules and it needs to go. Free up defenses to play however they want without arbitrary restriction.

*But it's gonna be boring, they'll just camp a 7 footer in the paint!*

Really? In 2020, the era of versatility and switchability, you think that would be an effective strat?

If someone does that, the offense is just gonna shoot. Everyone can shoot now. If your offense can't counter such a simple trick, then your offense is *bad*, and shouldn't be bailed out.

A welcome consequence of this would be increased activity in the mid-range. If the defending center is camping out under the basket, a natural counter will be to pop the 10-15 footer (if not a 3). Voila, this will pull the center out from the paint, and if it doesn't, you keep getting free middies.

Important to note that most plays would remain untouched, because usually there's an offensive player within arms length anyway. I don't buy that this would just turn every game into a shootout, because it wouldn't be an appreciable difference in most instances.

*Defense needs a buff.* This isn't world-altering, but it's a start. Allow teams to play how they want, able to leverage whatever advantages they believe they have, and allow the free market of basketball ideas to dictate the outcome. 3 in the key is a vague rule that's inconsistently enforced, and isn't necessary in the modern game.

The end result would be:

* more severe punishment of bad offenses

* a buff for high IQ, mobile rim protectors (who wouldn't have to worry about some random 5 second long ""3 second"" clock)

* increased midrange frequency

* decreased vagueness of the rules and enforcement (a big complaint regarding NBA officiating)",nbadiscussion
1037,42,What do people see in Zion Williamson that make them believe he will be this transcendent generational player?,"I'll be completely blunt and honest. I think he'll top out as a Blake Griffin kind of guy. This isn't a bad thing at all as BG is a great player and very under rated in my opinion. 

But outside of his athleticism, what other elite traits does he have?

He's undersized for his position and relies heavily on his athleticism and strength at the moment.

He doesn't really have any perimeter game. His handle is good for a PF, but he's more of a line drive slasher then someone who can break down the defense, shoot off the dribble, etc.

So what else do people see that i'm not about him that makes him look so great?

Also, i'm not bashing him at all. Just genuinely curious",nbadiscussion
1038,43,Are point guards modern basketball’s next victim?,"I read this article (https://www.insidehook.com/article/sports/nba-2020-season-after-coronavirus-shutdown) and most of it is pretty standard NBA blog material, but the last section of it is about the future of the point guard position--mainly the idea that point guards might suffer the same fate that centers recently have. 

Here's the relevant passage: ""To be sure, point guards are too offensively significant to ever be totally disregarded, but it’s becoming obvious that, in the playoffs at least, small defenders will be ceaselessly targeted until they either acquit themselves well or get benched. Whereas point guards who are switchable (think: Kyle Lowry and his video-vixen butt) or pyromaniac scorers (think: Damian Lillard or Steph Curry) will always have their place, the value of the position’s upper-middle-class might require a total recalibration. Brad Stevens will have to conjure defensive schemes that adequately hide Kemba Walker; the Clippers have already resigned themselves to the fact that Lou Williams will be utterly unplayable in the fourth quarter in the playoffs; the Hawks’ ceiling is capped until Trae Young provides more defense than a colander in a flood. As such, every point guard must confront a common question: Can you produce enough offensive value to justify your defensive weakness?""



Centers have famously been marginalized by small-ball, but small-ball isn't really totally accurate. It's been less of a down-sizing than a same-sizing. There's been a new wave of big playmakers (Luka, Ben Simmons) and the few drafts will have a lot of big guards and playmakers too (Lamelo, Killian Hayes, Cade Cunningham, Ty Haliburton, etc). Do you think all this will change how we look at traditional point guards?",nbadiscussion
1039,44,The next generation taking over the NBA," Doncic is doing legendary GOAT type shit.

The pre prime and early prime groups are very strong and deep. There are only three guys who are 33 and older that made my top 40 next year. Interestingly there is not a single top 40 guy who will be 33 as of January 1st of next year. There is at least one of every single age from 20-36 besides 33. 

The late prime guys are an amazing group, and they are still playing at a very high level. As of today it is still their league, that could change these playoffs, or next year.  The transfer of power in the leauge will occur over the next 2-3 years at the latest as the late prime group cross over into their post prime, and the young guys enter their early and mid primes.

It was surprising seeing how relatively weak the group of mid prime players are. Especially if you consider Kawhi and Irving more as late prime guys due to chronic injury issues.

It is also worth noting that besides the current draft class which looks to be historically bad, the next few drafts look fantastic. 2021 is loaded with top tier prospects led by Cunningham. 2022 has the best high school prospect in the nation with Bates, and 2023 has maybe the highest cieling prospect ever with super unicorn Wembanyma. Wembanyma is a 7-3 French kid who projects to be Gobert on defense, except he has a dynamic offensive game because he can dribble, pass, and shoot. Insane potential. The 2024 class will also be eligible in three years, as the NBA makes highschool kids eligible.

While LeBron, Harden, Curry and Kawhi might hold on to  the league for this season, and maybe even next, the future is coming fast, and I'm really excited for the next generation of guys.",nbadiscussion
1040,45,Who is the worst player to start all 82 games in a season?,"This was supposed to be a somewhat informative and lighthearted discussion about the worst players to play all 82 games. I was going to make a case for various players using some of easiest metrics possible. For what it's worth, here are the ""records"" held by players that played all 82 games in a season:

Fewest points- Chuck Hayes 2009-10 (358)

Fewest rebounds- John Paxson 1990-91 (91)

Fewest assists- Samuel Dalembert 2008-09 (18)

Fewest steals- Mark West 1992-93, and Robin Lopez 2015-16 (16)

Fewest blocks- Mark Jackson 2001-02 and Matt Maloney 1996-97 (1)

For the most part, these guys, as well as others that came close, fell into at least 1 of 3 categories. 

1. Bad player on a bad team

2. Decent player with a certain valuable skill-set

3. Young talent that the team played to see what they had

Some guys fell into multiple categories, but one that consistently showed up near the top of all these completely baffles me. 

Keith Bogans

Here are Bogans ranks among the all-time worst stats for a player that started all 82 games:

Fewest points- 2nd (359)

Fewest rebounds- 3rd (148)

Fewest assists- 56th (101)

Fewest steals- 20th (38)

Fewest blocks- 37th (9)

Here's one I didn't mention above. Fewest minutes- 1st (1,461)

Here are Bogans' averages that season (PPG/RPG/APG/SPG/BPG)- 4.4/1.8/1.2/.5/.1

Here's the most perplexing/infuriating part about Bogans. HE PLAYED FOR THE 62 WIN CHICAGO BULLS IN 2010-11.

That's right. Bogans played with an MVP, and Tom Thibodeau was coach of the year that season. What did the best coach in basketball that year decide to do with Bogans? Start him every game, then pretty much immediately bench him.

Bogans only played 17.8 minutes per game, and was 8th on the Bulls that year in total minutes. And what did he do with those minutes? Absolutely nothing. He was a decent 3 point shooter, but you know who else was that could have started every game instead? Only the guy who has the 10th best career 3 point shooting percentage of all-time: Kyle Korver.

Let's go through those categories again:

1. Bad player on a bad team

Not at all. Bogans was certainly bad, but the Bulls won 62 games that year, and were title favorites coming out of the East.

2. Decent player with a certain valuable skill-set

Nope. Bogans was far from decent, and his main skill set was shooting on a team that had one of the greatest 3 point shooters of all-time coming off the bench.

3. Young talent that the team played to see what they had

Not even close. Bogans was on his 7th team in his 8th season in the league at 30 years old. 

Now his coach Tom Thibodeau praised Bogans defense, and pointed to that as the reason why Bogan was starting. Want to know how valuable Thibodeau and the Bulls thought Bogans defense really was? The Bulls waived him minutes before their first practice of the 2011-12 season (he was set to have the 9th highest cap hit on the team that year at $1.73 million). 

There yah go. The worst player (by far in my opinion when considering their circumstance) to start all 82 games in a single season was Keith Bogans. If you have any reason to believe there was another player that should be bestowed this (dis)honor, please let me know, and may God have mercy on their basketball soul.",nbadiscussion
1041,46,Does the NBA putting all their eggs in the Zion basket give anyone else a bad feeling?,"Would love to hear some thoughts on this. 

The NBA has seemingly put a lot of eggs in the basket of Zion becoming the next big thing star. In the media too, everyone seems to be fighting to ride shotgun on the Zion train.

To me, that seems like an awful lot of pressure to put on a 19 year old who hasn't really proved anything yet. 

Yes, has was impressive in his games, but the hype started before his first game. 

It seems like they're putting a lot of pressure to be the best player going forward along with being the face of the league. 

Man, to me, this screams burnout by 23 and everyone jumping to take him down when he stumbles.",nbadiscussion
1042,47,I really like how each of the elite bigs in the league have their own strengths and weaknesses. No two unicorns are the same.,"#This post consists of me rambling about Embiid, Jokic, KAT, AD, Giannis, and Porzingis. (Be warned, it's pretty long.) 

Giannis, AD, and KP have primarily played PF this season, but they're still bigs.

#(EDIT: Added Bam and Siakam.)

By the way, why mention Porzingis, you might be thinking, since he hasn't been as good as the other players on the list this season? Well, I thought it would only be appropriate to include KP, as he was the OG ""Unicorn"" as crowned by KD in 2016, as a 7-footer who can shoot and defend at a high level:

>*""He can shoot, he can make the right plays, he can defend, he's a 7-footer that can shoot all the way out to the 3-point line,"" Durant said, according to ESPN's Royce Young. ""That's rare. And block shots -- that's like a unicorn in this league.""*

#For the purposes of this post, a ""unicorn"" is a tall player with All-NBA potential who spends a decent amount of time defending bigs and possesses a strong offensive skillset (hence someone like Rudy Gobert is omitted, as he's a defensive monster but has a more limited offensive skillset). 

Embiid is a borderline case with his more old-school, post-oriented offensive skillset, but he's at least a decent and willing shooter from midrange and 3, separating himself from the bigs of yore, and besides, he also makes for a nice contrast with some of the others on the list.

**Some terms I'll be using:**

**per 75** = per 75 possessions, i.e. points per 75 possessions = measure of a player's scoring rate. Each season and each team has a different pace, so adjusting for pace like this allows us to compare players' scoring more fairly than PPG. (Why 75 possessions? There isn't any grand reasoning- the average *(edit) high-usage modern NBA player simply uses roughly 75 possessions/game, so ""per 75"" stats are perhaps easier to intuitively understand for most people than ""per 100"" stats, which are available on Basketball Reference.)

**TS%** = true shooting percentage, i.e. a player's scoring efficiency, basically FG% but accounting for 3-pointers and free-throws

**rTS%** = relative true shooting percentage, i.e. how efficient a player's scoring is compared to league average scoring efficiency, which is 56.4 TS% in 2019-20 according to Basketball Reference
 
**ORTG** and **DRTG** are a team's offensive and defensive rating, respectively, with numbers taken from Basketball Reference.

**rORTG** = relative offensive rating, i.e. how good a team's offense is compared to league average offensive rating, which is 110.4 in 2019-20 according to Basketball Reference. 

**PnR** = Pick and roll, **DHO** = Dribble hand-off

#Joel Embiid | ""The Process"", ""Do-a-180""

**In a nutshell**: Philadephia 76ers C, 7-0, 250lb, All-Star. Basic stats: 23.4/11.8/3.1/0.9/1.3 with 3.1 TOVs on 47.4/34.8/81.4 splits (59.3 TS%), 44 games played. Advanced: 0.203 WS/48, 5.2 BPM. 

**The good:**


- - **Monster low-post scorer**: Embiid has an excellent scoring rate (~28 points per 75). He does most of his damage on offense by being the [most prolific post-scorer](https://stats.nba.com/players/playtype-post-up/) in the league (91st percentile in post scoring efficiency, 1st in frequency by a large margin), where Embiid's massive frame and Hakeem-esque post-game allow him to make opposing big men look helpless and draw fouls at a heady pace with his relentless bully ball.

- - **Decent scoring efficiency**: +3.0 rTS%, it mostly results from a monstrous free-throw rate (10.5 FTA per 75, 81.4 FT%) and elite scoring in the paint (72 FG% from 0-3 feet). His midrange shooting has improved to an acceptable 41% too, and his 3P shooting is a decent 35%. He's been slightly less efficient in the playoffs (56TS%, +1.1 rTS%), with the caveat being that he was afflicted by injury and that the Raptors had an all-time-great playoff defense and former DPOY Marc Gasol, who made his life a nightmare (18/9/3 on 53TS% that series).

- - **DPOY-level defender**: Embiid is an amazing defender, stemming from his elite rim protection (1.3bpg, Sixers defense improves by 7 points when he enters a game). His mammoth frame, length, and first-class shot-blocking instincts at the rim have given him a Gobert-like deterrent-effect on offenses, making opponents thinking twice about attacking the basket. The Sixers have 105.1 DRTG with Embiid on the floor, which would rank 3rd in the league. Even when he's having a bad day on offense, he can recover his impact on the other end - he was a *+84 over 7 games* against the Raptors last playoffs despite shooting poorly from the field, testament to his incredible defense.

**The not-as-good:**

- - **Heavy feet**: Embiid can be slightly lead-footed when switching onto perimeter players, and can be blown past on closeouts. He's still a decent perimeter defender overall, as his length and timing can allow him to recover well with strong contests from behind. 

- - **Spotty vision/passing**: JoJo has as many turnovers as assists. His decision-making falters somewhat under defensive pressure. His dribble is a bit loose, too, which doesn't help in this aspect. He can make basic passes out of double-teams, though more advanced reads are beyond him for now.

- - **3P-shooting has some room for improvement**: He came into the league shooting 37% in his rookie year, so he's regressed somewhat since then. He's shown marked improvement this season though, making 34.8% of his threes. Joel's next step will be attempting more 3s, since he currently takes fewer than 4 threes a game. His excellent FT% (81.4%) and passable midrange efficiency (41 FG%) bode well for future improvements in his 3P shooting.

- - **Durability**: Health will perhaps always be the biggest concern with Embiid- he's consistently missed an average of 20 games/year over his past 3 seasons. When he does see the court, he's generally been great.

- - - 

#Nikola Jokic | ""Joker"", ""Big Honey""

**In a nutshell**: Denver Nuggets C, 7-0, 253lb, weak MVP candidate. Basic stats: 20.2/10.2/6.9/1.2/0.7 with 3.1 TOVs on 52.8/31.4/81.3 splits (60.4 TS%), 65 games played. Advanced: 0.209 WS/48, 7.6 BPM. 


**The good:**

- - **Passing prodigy**: Best playmaking big in NBA history and one of the best passers in the league, period - Jokic's vision is reminiscent of a 7-foot Magic Johnson. He makes every single pass in the playbook quickly and accurately, never looking at his target in order to throw off defenders, adept at using his eyes to manipulate defenses. His [outlet passing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0CZ_4odpew) is the envy of any point guard - throwing [outlets like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De1OSDcb2fw) *mid-rebound* is unfair. Jokic runs Denver's offense from the high post, as the Nuggets' bevy of guards and wings whir around him for DHOs and PnRs. He rarely ever misses high-% layup-passes, and his otherworldly vision (helped by his 7ft frame allowing him to see over defenders) encourages his teammates to move and cut off the ball because he'll almost certainly get the ball to them the moment they make themselves open. Joker's height and wingspan allow him access to passing lanes not available to most guards and wings, deftly flicking it to teammates around the outstretched arms of defending bigs. Jokic can lob to his more athletic teammates, pitch bounce-passes to cutters through the tiniest of passing windows, no-look skip-passes to 3P-shooters, and is even capable of blending in passes with his shooting motion as he reads the help and rifles the ball neatly into a wide-open teammate's shooting/scoring pocket. For me, he's right up there as one of the finest passers in the game.

- - **Very good, efficient scorer**: 23.2 points per 75 on +4 rTS%, mostly stemming from his [versatile post game](https://stats.nba.com/players/playtype-post-up/) and decent midrange scoring (45 FG%). He's also got excellent touch around the rim, mixing in some floaters and hooks (elite 60.2 FG% from 3-10 ft), along with throwing his weight around in the post and pump-faking defenders into oblivion to get easy looks at the rim (elite 73 FG% from 0-3 ft). He also likes following his own/opponent misses- he has 3 offensive rebounds a game. Encouragingly, there exists some precedent for Joker elevating his offensive production when the team requires it - he put up 25/13/8 on +4.8 rTS% in 2019 playoffs, up from 20/11/7 on +2.9 rTS% in the 2019 regular season. 

- - **Not a bad team defender!** : Sound positioning and good hands(healthy steal rate for a big, ~2%) + his size and length allow him to retain good value on defense.  Denver's defensive rating actually *improves* by +1.6 points when he's on the court.

- - **Clutch play**: Jokic has been one of the most [clutch](https://stats.nba.com/players/clutch-traditional/?Season=2019-20&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&PerMode=Totals&sort=PTS&dir=-1) players in the league this season- he even had two game-winners against the Sixers and Wolves.  The Nuggets are ranked 5th in clutch-win% in the league (26-14 record in clutch situations) largely due to Jokic's play.

- - **Durability**: Jokic has always been highly durable, having yet to miss a game this season. He's missed a grand total of 20 games in his entire 5-year career.

**The not-as-good:**

- - **Paint-defense**: Jokic doesn't offer too much in the way of rim-protection (low block rate for a big, opponents shoot a pretty high 63 FG% in the paint when Jokic is the nearest defender). Although, as mentioned previously, his good positioning and size/length plus IQ/anticipation make him an adequate/decent team defender, often making smart rotations to stall opponent forays to the rim.  

- -  **Perimeter-defense**: He also suffers from some of the the same heavy-footedness that Embiid has when switched onto non-bigs, albeit to a higher degree. 

- - **3P-shooting**: Jokic's outside shooting has been poor/inconsistent (31.4% from 3), though with some flashes of potential (he shot 40% in 2018, 39% in 2019 playoffs). His solid shooting from the midrange (45%) and from the FT line (81%) bodes well for him stretching out more succesfully in the future.

- -  **Is perhaps too selfless on offense**: Especially compared to the other behemoths on this list, Joker could probably afford to call on his own number *slightly* more often when it comes to scoring. I doubt his coaches or teammates would *mind* him scoring more, given how efficient and unselfish he normally is, and given Jamal Murray is a much less efficient scorer (-0.5 rTS%) than Jokic despite taking more shot attempts than Nikola. Jokic is clearly *capable* of elevating his scoring, as mentioned earlier. Given that Denver's offense is generally quite good (+2.1 rORTG this season, +2.6 rORTG last season), I don't think Jokic will necessarily change what he's doing as it's been working decently so far. However, if he wants to run a truly elite offense or be considered one of the league's best offensive players (along with Steph, LeBron, Harden, Doncic etc.), he could think about starting to score more.

- - - 

#Karl-Anthony Towns | ""KAT""

**In a nutshell**: Minnesota Timberwolves C, 6-11, 248lb, All-Star level. Basic stats: 26.5/10.8/4.4/0.9/1.2 with 3.1 TOVs on 50.8/41.2/79.6 splits (64.2 TS%), 35 games played. Advanced: 0.205 WS/48, 7.8 BPM. 


**The good:**

- - **Elite, multi-level 3-point threat**: KAT is already probably the best 3-point shooting big in NBA history, taking into account volume and efficiency - he's shot 41.2% from 3 on 7.9 attempts per game this season. (For reference, Klay Thompson, from 2015-2019, averaged 42.3% from 3 on 7.7 attempts per game.) The only players to shoot more accurately than Towns on at least as many attempts this year were Duncan Robinson (44.5%, 8.4) and Dāvis Bertāns (42.4%, 8.7). KAT's shooting is is in rarefied air. He doesn't just stand in a corner and wait for Jeff Teague or DLo to pass him the ball, either. He shoots these off-the-dribble, catch-and-shoot, stepbacks, pick-and-pop, diving around screens like he's some oversized Reggie Miller. The spacing and gravity he provides the Minnesota offense with his shooting and off-ball movement is tremendous. He destroyed the Jazz once earlier this season by hitting 7 threes and pulling reigning DPOY Gobert all the way out to the 3-point line, pushing their paint-centric defensive scheme to the breaking point. The Wolves improve by *12* points on offense when he's on the court.

- - **Well-rounded, exceptionally-efficient scorer**: His offensive impact isn't limited to shooting, not by a long shot- close out on him too hard and he'll drive to the rim, where he's finishing at an elite 72 FG%. He barely takes any midrange shots- only 7% of his total shots come from there. His post game, however, is decently efficient (61st percentile), though he doesn't utilise it as much as Embiid or Jokic. Overall, due his incredible outside shooting, rim finishing, and decent foul drawing(8.8 FTA per 100, 79.6 FT%), his scoring output is extremely impressive- 27.2 points per 75 on amazing efficiency (*+8* rTS%).

- -  **Decent passer**: KAT's passing has come along this year (4.4 APG), making good reads when he's doubled in the perimeter or in the post and finding cutters with regularity. He has a passable AST/TO ratio for a big (1.4:1). 

- - **Good post-defense**: He's good at defending other post scorers (eg. Embiid, AD), where he can take advantage of his length and strength. 

**The not-as-good:**

- - **Not great at most other aspects of defense**: His blocks (1.2 bpg) are more the result of block-chasing than good positioning. He's poor at navigating pick-and-roll defense. He's possibly the most laterally-challenged of the bigs in this list, his transition defense is bad, and he often falls for pump fakes. He shows potential for becoming a good rim protector- when he does manage to get in front of his man and get his hands up in time, his opponent rim DFG% is pretty great (~50 FG%)! However, his motor and defensive-IQ aren't the best- he can be found ball-watching sometimes or falling behind opponent plays, losing track of cutters or getting stranded in no man's land. Overall, Minnesota are nearly +8 points better on defense with Towns *off* the court. (The usually defensively-challenged Wolves were a top 10 defense for a period when KAT missed 15 games earlier on in the season, thought that was also partly because his replacement Gorgui Dieng was a defensive god.)

- - **Some holes in passing game**: There's still room for improvement in this aspect. He's still relatively turnover-prone, and misses open high-% passes under the rim sometimes.

- - **Durability**: Prior to this season, this was one of Town's greatest *strengths*- he didn't miss a single game during his 1st 3 seasons and only 5 games his 4th season (last year), and that was only because he got into a car accident. This year, however, the script has changed- he's missed *30 games* with a sprained knee followed by a fractured wrist. 

- - - 

#Anthony Davis | ""AD"", ""The Brow""

**In a nutshell**: Los Angeles Lakers PF/C, 6-10, 253lb, weak MVP candidate. Basic stats: 26.7/9.4/3.1/1.5/2.4 with 2.5 TOVs on 51.1/33.5/84.5 splits (61.4 TS%), 55 games played. Advanced: 0.262 WS/48, 8.5 BPM. 

**The good**:

- - **Excellent all-round volume-scorer**: 27.8 points per 75, on ~ +5 rTS%. AD has a versatile scoring arsenal, capable of shifting his offensive game to fit cleanly within different offensive schemes (e.g. higher pace in NOLA vs. LeBron's more methodical half-court style). Possesses a [variety of post-moves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5AbcB4AkFM), hooks, spins, fakes, stepbacks, turnarounds, etc.; has a passable face-up game with a good handle, moves like a guard and capable of athletic finishes at the rim. This season he's been skilled at leaking out in transition to receive LeBron's outlet passes. His scoring has translated well to the playoffs- he's averaged 27.3 points per 75 on ~ +5 rTS% in his 3 playoff series.

- - **Vertical spacer**: All-time lob-finisher (75 FG% from 0-3 feet). Davis's catch-radius is one of the best in NBA history. Just throw it up in the general direction of the rim and he'll make it work somehow with his touch and athleticism. His addition to the Lakers is a major reason why LeBron's leading the league in assists (2.8 of LeBron's 10.6 assists/game go to AD). It's an underrated part of his game as it allows him to fit with a variety of teams and mesh well with ball-dominant stars.

- - **Decent passer**: This is mostly based on his last season at New Orleans, which was his peak year as a passer. In the 2019 season, with their starting PGs missing significant time due to injury, the Pelicans leaned on Jrue Holiday's versatile playmaking gifts more, but they also parked AD in the high post and ran offense through him from there, letting him weaponise his own threat to score by feeding cutters with neat interior pocket passes or spraying kickout passes to shooters when he got doubled. He averaged 4.4 assists and only 2.0 turnovers prior to his trade request, producing a very efficient 2.2:1 AST/TO ratio. However, AD's playmaking has regressed this season (only 3.3 APG, uninspiring AST/TO ratio of 1.25:1) as he's gone more off-ball than in 2019 with LeBron manning point full-time in LA.

- - **DPOY-level defender**: Highly likely to finish in the top-2 in voting this season. His weakside rim-protection is elite - the Lakers have had a top-3 defense due in no small part to his efforts. He's highly switchable, too, capable of jumping onto guards and wings as required and scaring them silly. His motor has been excellent and he closes out hard on shooters. He's handsy as well, with good defensive instincts- he has a good eye for anticipating plays and jumping passing lanes. His steal-rate is elite for a big, and he hasn't gambled *too* much this year, either. He often cleans up mistakes by teammates, allowing them the freedom to play aggressive defense on the perimeter because they know that he's always got a watchful eye out to pounce on any perpetrators who make it past them. Works well in tandem with the Lakers bigs (Dwight/McGee) so that if either of them gets beat, he is still there to protect the rim. Strangely enough, the Lakers' defensive rating actually improves when he sits, perhaps because Dwight/McGee are more than weaker opponent bench units can handle.

- - **Surprisingly healthy**: The opposite of KAT - durability is generally considered a weakness of AD's, but this season he's missed only 8 games. Good stuff!

**The not-as-good:**

- - **3P/Midrange Shooting**: Much like Embiid, AD's 33.5% 3-point shooting on 3.5 attempts/game isn't awful, but it isn't good enough to consistently garner defenders' respect either. His midrange efficiency isn't great, either, too, at about 38 FG%. The latter isn't too detrimental to his overall scoring game, however, as it at least allows him to keeps defender honest in the post. Regardless, his foul drawing (8.3 FTA per 100, 85 FT%) and elite rim finishing does allow him to  compensate for his relatively weaker jumper.

- - **Ability to run an offense**: It remains to be seen whether AD can run an efficient team offense as a *primary initiator*, like a slasher like Giannis/LeBron/Kawhi or a full-time high-post operator like Jokic in Denver or Kevin Garnett back in the day on the Wolves. Perhaps further improving his handle or his strength will allow him to do so, since he already proved he possesses decent playmaking vision in New Orleans last year. When LeBron's been off the court this season, his decision-making on-the-ball has been inconsistent at times. Even so, as things stand, the Lakers still have a good offense (+2.6 rORTG) with AD playing primarily off-ball, so I doubt that's going to change much in the foreseeable future. 

- - **Some areas for improvement on defense**: Ball-watches every so often, though greatly improved from last season. Quicker guards can still occasionally blow by him. Misses the odd help scenario. Gambles sporadically for steals, though it works out for him more often than not. The KAT's and Embiid's and Giannis's of the world have sometimes caused him trouble before, though he often holds his own too.

#Giannis Antetokounmpo | ""The Greek Freak""

**In a nutshell**: Milwaukee Bucks PF/C, 6-11, 242lb, strong MVP candidate. Basic stats: 29.6/13.7/5.8/1.0/1.0 with 3.7 TOVs on 54.7/30.6/63.3 splits (60.8 TS%), 57 games played. Advanced: 0.282 WS/48, 11.5 BPM. 

**The good:**

- - **All-time-level slasher and rim-finisher**: Elite drive-and-kick game that is the crux of Milwaukee's 7th-ranked offense. A monster in transition, and getting increasingly comfortable as a shooter in half-court situations. Has some post-moves too, with some basic fadeaways, flip shots, and hooks, made all the more dangerous with his incredible wingspan. Has started taking more midrange and three-point jumpshots off-the-dribble this season. 

- - **Elite volume scorer**: Giannis has the highest scoring rate in the league (yes, higher than James Harden), on good efficiency: 32.9 points per 75 on ~ +4.5 rTS%. He is the likely MVP, leading a historically good Bucks team while averaging only 30.9 minutes per game. There are some worries that elite playoff defenses (most famously, the Toronto Raptors in the 2019 ECF) can limit his scoring output (22/14/6 on 52 TS% that series), but it's really only the *very very best* of defenses, with ideal personnel and scheme, that have proven that they can slow him down. He mowed down Boston's 1st- and 7th-ranked defenses in consecutive postseasons, to the tune of 26/12/5 on 62 TS% in 2018, and 28/11/5 on 62 TS% in 2019. What the Raptors accomplished in 2019 isn't easily replicable.

- - **Transition terror**: The most prolific [transition scorer](https://stats.nba.com/players/transition/?sort=POSS&dir=1/) in the league, with his long, long strides, speed, length, and power/skill around the rim. Also, shoutout to his huge hands and underrated handle for letting to him to move as fast as he does with the ball.

- - **[DPOY-level defender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQgnY-ZA9tg)**: The favourite to win the award this season, he's a high-level rim-deterrent with his length, instincts, and athleticism. Opponents score an anemic 41% at the rim when Giannis is the closest defender, the best mark in the league. He's also a skilled perimeter defender. Milwaukee improve by +8.0 points on defense when he's on the court (they have a ridiculous 98.7 DRTG when Giannis plays), and he [rates very highly](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/gnd7ej/giannis_antetokounmpo_vs_anthony_davis_for_the/) on the majority of available defensive impact metrics. [2019-20 Milwaukee](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/few-teams-have-ever-defended-like-these-milwaukee-bucks/) are one of the [best defensive teams *ever*](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/g2w1i7/the_201920_bucks_have_been_one_of_the_best/), and Giannis is the best overall defender on the team. He's long, fast, twitchy, and strong, capable of switching 1-5 without batting an eye. With the Lopez twins walling off the rim, Giannis is free to roam and generally wreak havoc where needed, scaring shooters off the line, providing weakside rim-help as required, shadowing ball-handlers step-for-step and occasionally stamping their layups onto the glass with his huge paws or simply clouding their vision with his massive reach. When he *is* beat by a guard/wing on the perimeter, he doesn't chase blocks, instead staying grounded and disciplined, often funneling these slashers to the equally-long waiting arms of human fly-swatter Brook Lopez at the rim as the Bucks' game-plan decrees, while he stalks them from behind, helping effectively make the paint a no-fly zone. Much like AD, his condor wingspan shrinks passing lanes and deters high-leverage interior passes.

- - **Decent passer**: An adept and willing passer for a 7-foot human, gathering 5.8 APG this season. He's skilled at lasering kickouts to Milwaukee's armada of shooters if his initial penetration fails/draws help defenders, and has some success making tight interior passes near the rim. 

- - **Durability**: Giannis is rarely injured.


**The not-as-good:**

- - **Some areas to improve in terms of passing/vision**: Has room to improve in terms of interior passing, sometimes doesn't recognise open cutters or the passes themselves can be off-target etc.. Turnover-prone at times, has imperfect decision-making if he's under intense ball-pressure by elite defensive bigs/wings (guys like Bam, Embiid, Jonathan Isaac). Notably, the Raptors' [monster playoff defense](https://i.imgur.com/3LPH0UU.png) led by the [length and IQ of Kawhi/Gasol/Siakam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-EPx-v1XIY) greatly tested his passing ability and decision-making last playoffs, leading to him turning the ball over much more often than usual (5.5 assists : 4.2 turnovers). 

- - **Poor outside shooting**: Giannis has become much more comfortable *taking* these shots, attempting nearly 5 a game this season, but he's still not very good at *making* them (30.6 3P%). Defenses still heave a sigh of relief when they see him pulling up for 3. He's also shooting 38% from midrange, which isn't much better.

- - **Some areas for improvement on defense**: Has occasional lapses on off the ball, arriving late on help, whether due to motor/ball-watching or  not recognising plays until it's too late; can get blown past by quick guards due when he closes out sometimes (though his length/athleticism helps clean up some of his own errors); has trouble navigating screens sometimes because he's so large. Like AD, elite post-players can still overpower him on occasion, but luckily for Giannis there aren't that many elite post players any more.

- - **FT shooting**: This could be an aberration, but his FT-shooting has greatly regressed this season, at 63 FT%. This can limit his effectiveness on offense in clutch situations (notably, he shot a ghastly 58% from the line against the Raptors in last season's ECF), and put a cap on his overall scoring efficiency. Prior to 2020, he's shot 74% in the regular season, so he's certainly capable of being a decent FT-shooter.

#Kristaps Porzingis | ""KP"", ""Unicorn""

**In a nutshell**: Dallas Mavericks PF/C, 7-3, 240lb, Sub-All Star. Basic stats: 19.2/9.5/1.7/0.7/2.1 with 1.6 TOVs on 42.0/34.9/77.6 splits (54.0 TS%), 51 games played. Advanced: 0.129 WS/48, 1.5 BPM. 


**The good**: 

- - **Potential elite shooter**: Porzingis's offensive potential still lies mainly in his incredible shooting (40% from 3 in 2018), though he's yet to recover that elite form this season. However, he remains highly dangerous, taking a wide variety of threes at a very high rate (7.1 attempts per game) and hitting a decent enough percentage of them (35%) that defenders have to respect his shot. In his last 14 games, he averaged 37% on 9.1 attempts per game. Much like KAT, he's a dynamic shooter, shooting off movement, off-the-dribble, off-the-catch (& pick-and-pop), pulling up from well behind the 3-point line, etc., spacing the floor for Dallas's resident offensive genius Luka to go to work. 

- - **Good rim finisher**: He finishes very well at the rim (72 FG%).

- - **Elite paint defender**: Porzingis flashes All-Defensive value with his rim-protection (led the league in blk% in 2018, is 6th in blk% and has very good paint DFG% of 49.5% in 2020), and defensive instincts. The Mavs improve by 3.2 points on defense with Porzingis on the floor. His oft-maligned rebounding has greatly improved this season, too, snagging almost 10 boards a game, up from 6.6 in his last healthy season on the Knicks.

**The not-as-good**:

- - **Very limited playmaking**: KP's passing/vision remains his weakest suit (1.7 assists/game). He's actually improved slightly this season, being a more willing passer and participant in Dallas's dynamic offense, but his assist rate still lags in the single digits, at 8.6% (for reference, AD's is about 15%, KAT 23%, Jokic 34%), and he has almost as many turnovers as assists. 

- - **Scoring efficiency/shooting**: His poor shooting to start the season coming off a serious injury hurt his efficiency, which is currently 2 points below league average (-2 rTS%). He averaged an excellent 60TS% in his final 14 games, though, signs that he was rounding into form before the quarantine hit.

- - **Not a great perimeter defender, but still decent**: With his lanky 7'3'' frame, he's not the best at closing out to shooters (opposing players hit 40% of their threes when he's the closest defender), and while he can move his feet decently for a big and he's surprisingly athletic, his [fundamentals defending the perimeter](https://www.postingandtoasting.com/2018/7/23/17575076/can-kristaps-porzingis-defend-the-perimeter) and effort can seemingly be lacking sometimes: he's often ""flat-footed, erect"", and doesn't always have his hands up. 

- - **Durability**: KP has missed a season and a half prior to this one with a torn ACL, and missed 15 games *this* season too. His health remains a huge asterisk, though it's promising that he was healthy and playing games up until the quarantine hit - he played 20 of the Mavs' last 25 games.

That's it for today. Thanks for reading!

**JUST KIDDING, I FORGOT ABOUT BAM. 

#Bam Adebayo | ""Bam"", ""Bam Bam""

**In a nutshell**: Miami Heat PF/C, 6-9, 255lb, All-Star. Basic stats: 16.2/10.5/5.1/1.2/1.3 with 2.8 TOVs on 56.7/7.7/69.0 splits (60.6 TS%), 65 games played. Advanced: 0.175 WS/48, 3.6 BPM. 

**The good:**

- - **Versatile inside scorer**: 17.6 points per 75 on +4.2 rTS%. Bam was a revelation for the Heat this season, utilising his length and explosive athleticism well to finish at the rim (both from half-court and in transition), scoring at an elite rate (73.5 FG%) from 0-3ft. He's an adept lob-finisher from Miami's guards, with about 72% of his total baskets being assisted - for comparison's sake, AD, a similarly adept off-ball rim-finisher (albeit on better efficiency and much higher volume), has about 64% of his total baskets assisted. Similar to AD, Bam's far from a one-trick pony when it comes to scoring, often running pick-and-rolls and hand-offs with Miami's army of guards and wings (he has especially good chemistry with Duncan Robinson and Jimmy Butler) to find clean looks at the rim. He often employs his 7.1ft wingspan and athleticism to rebound team misses (including his own), with 2.5 offensive rebounds/game either resulting in tip-ins or neat passes to open teammates. He's got surprisingly deft touch further away from the rim, too, with little floaters, finger-rolls, and hooks in the paint (outside the painted area), finishing there at an impressive 45% rate (his hooks are especially efficient, going in 56% of the time). Outside of the paint, his short-midrange game is money, too, for a big, finishing 42% of his short midrange attempts. Going any further than that, though, yields diminishing returns for Bam - he shoots a woeful 19 FG% outside 16 feet. Fortunately for Miami, though, Bam sticks to his strengths, with only 7% of his total shot attempts coming from outside 16ft. 

- - **Elite passer for a big**: Outside of Jokic and Draymond, there isn't a better passing big in the game today. His 5.1 assists/game are impressive enough, but it's the way he goes about getting these dimes that stands out. Coach Spoelstra has effectively given him the keys to Miami's offense this season for a reason- his offensive IQ is excellent, and he routinely makes quick and smart decisions with the ball in his hands. As stated earlier, he's Miami's primary high post operator, with Bam's dribble handoffs (DHOs) and PnRs with their guards being one of the primary features of their offense. His low post passing is great, too, often setting up Miami's other bigs with adept interior bounce passes and lobs when the help commits to him, and he can drive-and-kick to the Heat's shooters as well, Giannis-style. In transition, he's fully capable of and willing to grab a defensive rebound and start the break on his own - he's got a really good handle for a big - either creating his own score with that elite paint finishing we talked about, or making quick kickouts to Duncan Robinson for transition 3s. If a transition score doesn't happen at first, he will push for a quick DHO with a guard, with Bam's elite screening and Miami's elite shooters meaning that said 3PA is highly likely to go in. [Bam is highly active on offense, too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Lmd7npeto), always either scoring, setting a screen, or orchestrating from the elbows.

- - **Elite, multi-positional defender**: In the words of [Zach Lowe's excellent piece on Bam](https://www.espn.com.au/nba/story/_/id/28678382/bam-adebayo-fiercest-best-nba-player-know), he is ""addicted"" to defense. Bam is an incredibly high-motor and versatile defender, and is already an All-Defensive lock in his first season as a starter. His steal rates (elite for a big) and block rates speak for themselves, but his [versatility](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/g6giib/before_the_breakout_rookiesophomore_bam_adebayo/) is what stands out the most - he's equally capable when switched onto [Stephen Curry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm9jXof-BKQ) as he is [Giannis Antetokounmpo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGJhN4M8Gms). Opponents shoot [worse from every spot on the floor](https://stats.nba.com/player/1628389/defense-dash/) when Bam is the closest defender (43 FG% overall), be it from 3 (33.8%) or in the paint (55.8%). Bam's footwork and fundamentals guarding the perimeter are impeccable, shuffling perfectly along with guards and wings as they try to dribble past, reminiscent of Draymond or KG, and his strength and wingspan allows him to bang down low with the behemoths of the league as well, despite standing at 'only' 6-8. He's a ferocious and competitive rebounder, too, a major contributor to Miami's 3rd-ranked defensive rebounding rate.

- - **Durability**: Bam has played in *every single game* for Miami the past two seasons.

- - - 

**The less good:**

- - **Some gaps in playmaking**: He's a bit *too* excitable sometimes, and can turn the ball over trying to squeeze the ball through tiny gaps between defenders' arms near the rim. I love his aggression and offensive ideas, though - these high percentage passes put a lot of pressure on opponent defenses. His AST/TO ratio of 1.8:1 is still fantastic for a player who's helping Jimmy Butler run a strong Miami offense (+2.3 rORTG) for the first time. He can miss the shooting pocket occasionally too, and his vision isn't perfect, missing open teammates on occasion. With more experience and once he becomes a more dangerous scorer, he will presumably become a better passer as the passing lanes become more open when he starts to command more defensive attention.
 
- - **Non-existent 3P shooting**: Bam is (correctly) completely ignored by defenders on the perimeter (once again, he shoots a horrendous 19 FG% outside 16 feet). The Heat's system masks these flaws, making great use of his physical gifts as a fantastic and physical screener and elite passing big in DHOs and PnRs. His shot selection helps issues, too, as the vast majority (93%) of his shot attempts come inside 16 feet. On other teams with fewer offensive weapons, his lack of spot up shooting would likely become a larger issue. 

- - **Lower scoring rate than peers**: Bam's scoring rate pales in comparison to some of the other guys in this list, and there will be a ways to go before he becomes a primary scoring option. His [post game](https://stats.nba.com/players/playtype-post-up/?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*adebayo) is below average (40th percentile), his [ISO-scoring](https://stats.nba.com/players/isolation/?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*adebayo) is only barely passable (50th percentile). In the PnR he's proficient as both a [roll-man](https://stats.nba.com/players/roll-man/?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*Adebayo) (67th percentile) and, amusingly, on *very* low volume, as a [ball-handler](https://stats.nba.com/players/ball-handler/#!?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*Adebayo) (84th percentile). Perhaps expanding his post-game will allow Miami to run more offense through him like Denver do with Jokic, or Philly with Embiid/Lakers with AD. Alternatively, he could practise and develop his outside shooting more.

- - **Some defensive flaws**: Bam's rim protection lags behind the best (Gobert, Giannis, AD, Brook Lopez, Embiid, Draymond, Jonathan Isaac etc.), and larger centers can still finish over him on occasion (his 6-8 frame probably comes into play here). While Bam's man defense is impeccable, his team defensive impact seems to lag behind slightly- he's possibly a touch slow on help rotations occasionally or ball-watches sometimes. Miami's defensive rating with Bam on the floor would rank around 12th in the league (109.6 DRTG, +0.8 rDRTG), and it ""only"" improves by +1.7 points when Bam enters the game. However, defense, of course, is a team effort- the Jazz's seemingly perpetual top 5 defense dropped to 11th this year, even though Gobert's arguably been better on that end than he's ever been from the eyetest - losing defensive stalwarts in Favors and Rubio probably contributed to that. In Miami's case, key starter Duncan Robinson isn't a great defender, and they lack good defensive bigs outside of Adebayo- there's only so much one man can do;  backup Cs Leonard and Olynyk (primarily shooters) are woeful rim protectors, and Jones Jr is decent but primarily plays SF. It's to Bam's and Butler's (and Spoelstra's) credit that the team has a positive defensive rating at all.

EDIT 2: Some exposition on per 75 by /u/pbcorporeal

>A modern NBA game has about 100 possessions (a little more actually). An important player will usually average about 34-35 minutes a game which is a little under 75% of the total minutes.

>So per 75 brings the stats roughly in line with what we're used to a player's stats being on a per game basis so recognising what a ""good"" level becomes more intuitive (like using per 36 instead of per 48).

1043,48,It is extremely disappointing how the Sixers are completely unable to get the ball to Embiid and execute in clutch possessions,"this got removed from /r/nba for whatever reason

This is a frequent concern that people bring up here. There are many times it’s exaggerated; after all we can’t expect him to just post up and dunk on everyone every single possession over a full game.

But there are situations where the announcers are 100% correct about this. Watching this game it’s so disappointing watching this Sixers offense in the clutch. With no Simmons the Sixers obviously take a huge step back on defense but the advantage is that there’s a lot more spacing and in theory more room for Embiid to work vs smaller players.

The Sixers went on a good run to get within 4 points with less than 2 minutes left. The next possession, Embiid stood in the left corner all possession. Theis bodied him up and was extremely physical. Embiid is bigger than him yet made zero attempt to outmuscle him and get in position to score. He just stood in the corner all possession.

The next possession as he’s coming down the Celtics switch off of him off a pick, leaving MARCUS SMART on Embiid. He made absolutely zero attempt to body up or even engage with Smart. He just sort of roamed around the perimeter. The Sixers ended up settling for a contested Tobias Harris fadeaway. It bricked and Embiid was under the paint but couldn’t get the board. Sixers foul, Celtics hit all their FTs, game over.

This was extremely disappointing and it really felt like the Sixers could have taken this one if they executed better in the clutch. Part of it is Brett Brown being horrible at that and part of it is Embiid being passive when he needs to step up as their best player and dominate on the most important possessions of the game.

1044,49,Main takeaways from the Finals: LeBron is still dominant force under the rim and AD had (one of) the best defensive performances in the Finals in recent years,"To start, here are two charts. 

The [1st chart](https://i.imgur.com/fqpw7Un.png) is related to the first ""topic"" and shows the efficiencies within the Restricted Area. The x-axis is the number of shots from that area, the y-axis is the efficiency. Data is from 1996-97 season up to current one. Data is from entire Playoffs.

On the [second chart](https://i.imgur.com/S2Lx01s.png) we have the number of allowed shots per game, and on the y-axis the efficiency of those shots (so here we measure the defensive efficiency, the lower the percentage the better). Data is from 2013-14 season up to current one.

LeBron is just as effective at 35 (almost 36) as he was a few years ago in Cleveland, but also when he was in his prime years in Miami. It was in Miami when he raised the level of his game in terms of attacking the basket from very good to elite. His efficiency is at the level of (or even better than) elite centers, such as Shaq in the Lakers, Dwight in his best days in Orlando or Amar’e in the Run and Gun Phoenix Suns. He scored much “faster” this year than in Cleveland. By that I mean that he scored a lot more through fast breaks and transitions, which was especially visible in the 6th match...

The amazing defensive performance of Anthony Davis in the finals. IMO his defense is a huge reason for the Lakers’ success, because after all, most of their offensive success is based on transition (as I mentioned before). Davis showed the full plethora of his defensive skills in this series. From guarding Adebayo, Heat's guards, shutting off handoffs on Hero/Robinson, great defense in pick and roll where his length allowed him to cover both ball handler and roll man, and in the end he showed phenomenal one-on-one defense on Butler. Butler shot 48% against Davis, while against all other players he shot 58%! So Davis ""reduced"" his shot percentage by as much as 10%...

In my opinion, this was perhaps the most impressive defensive performance in the last few years...

1045,50,"I'm pretty new to watching the NBA, or any american sport for that matter, how do you guys take the fact that 48 minutes of play are dragged over 150 minutes of mostly publicity, with so little actual game going on?","Hey guys, first I'd like to say that this is the point of view of a person who's hardly ever watched any ""american"" sports, or american broadcasts of any sport, such as NFL, NHL, NBA, MLB. If my viewings and opinions seem contrary or really different to yours, it's probably because they actually come from a different way of watching sports throughout my life.

I just can't wrap my head around the fact that a 48 minutes game can be dragged as long as two and a half hours. I used to mostly watch NBA highlights, which make it seem pretty exciting, so I thought I'd try watching ""the real thing"" and sit through the full-length games now that the playoffs have started, and let me tell you, I hate it. There'll be thirty seconds of play, timeout, commercial break. Game restarts, 10 seconds of play, foul. Oh, now they're reviewing it, I guess it's a good time to go to another break. They begin playing again, oh a 7-0 run, timeout again, commercial break. Maybe 20 minutes will have passed where you only watched 5 minutes of actual basketball, if you're lucky. It drives me mad.

The part I hate most, is the 4th quarter. It's supposed to be exciting whenever it's a close game, but it ends up being rather insufferable. The refs will call so many soft fouls that it feels like I'm watching a free throw competition, and of course there's a timeout every minute and a half, and they feel like they last FOREVER.

I guess what I'm trying to ask is the following: How do you take this? Do you watch 82 games of this every year, plus the playoffs? games nearing almost three hours day in and day out? I know that americans are kind of desensitized to all of this, because this is the way sports are consummed in your country, but let me tell you, as an outsider to that culture it just seems insane.

#Luka Dončić | ""Luka"", ""Wonderboy""
**In a nutshell**: 21 y/o, Dallas Mavericks PG/SG/SF, 6-7, 218lb, weak MVP candidate. **Stats:** 28.7/9.3/8.7/1.1/0.2 with 4.2 TOVs on 46.1/31.8/75.2 shooting splits (58.4 TS%), 54 games played. ***Nerd stats:*** *37.0% usage, +1.3 on/off, +4.87 PIPM ^((4th)^) , +6.6 RAPTOR ^((5th)^) , +6.9 BPM (Backpicks) ^((3rd)^) , +8.4 BPM (BBRef) ^((6th)^) , +3.72 RPM (ESPN) ^((11th)^)*.

#**The good**:

- 🟢 **Prolific volume-scorer** (31.3 points per 75, on +2.0 rTS%)

Dončić possesses the 3rd-highest scoring-rate in the league this season, bested only by Giannis and Harden. Luka is a high-level isolation-scorer  *^((1.03 PPP, 82nd percentile)^)* and a certifiable PnR maestro even as a sophomore *^((1.04 PPP, 91st percentile)^)*.

- 🟢 **Elite rim-finisher for a wing**

Despite often being touted as a behind-the-arc gunner, Luka is actually at his most potent in the **paint**,  scoring at an absurd  [72.8 FG%](https://stats.nba.com/player/1629029/shooting/?sort=FG_PCT&dir=1) in the Restricted Area, reminiscent of modern paint-titans like Giannis and AD (72.9 FG%). Luka's overall 2P% is 57%, a figure comparable to many bigs'.

Luka added strength to his frame in the 2019-20 offseason, allowing him to absorb contact better, and combined with his Harden-esque foul-drawing prowess, he's become a veritable Free-Throw Magnet (9.1 FTA/game, 5th in NBA). 

Luka is a counter-heavy player, constantly reading how the defense reacts and shifting seamlessly between moves to find a high-quality shot for himself and his teammates. His moves are methodical and shifty, faking defenders out of their shoes with pivots, feints, spins, and impeccable footwork. His first-step is decent but his deceleration is elite, often stopping and restarting his drives on a dime, blending change-of-pace brilliantly with strength and craft to consistently reach the rim, using his size and touch to finish in a variety of creative ways once he's there. 

Slightly further away from the rim, Dončić is capable of making shots in the non-restricted area of the paint ^((42 FG% there)^) as well, where he possesses good feel. Luka's floater is adequate and he employs it frequently ^((43 FG%, 134 attempts)^) , but his midrange diet is sparse, leaning into Moreyball principles of shot-selection - only 4.8% of his total attempts are from midrange ^((35fg%)^) .

- 🟢 **High-volume 3-point shooter**

Luka averages a colossal 9.1 3PA/game (6th in the NBA), stringing together several smooth dribble moves to create space for his **stepback-3**. He's attempted 236 of these this season, 2nd in the league behind James Harden, and he's shot a very respectable [34.7 3p%](https://stats.nba.com/player/1629029/shooting/?sort=FG3A&dir=1) on them.

While his efficiency on his 3s **overall** leaves much to be desired (31.8 3P%) owing to shot-selection and consistency issues, the threat of his stepback as well as his *reputation* as a competent and highly-willing shooter means that he can tug on defenses like a puppet-master, leveraging his shooting threat to fake and drive into the teeth of the paint, where he's devilishly effective as a high-level scorer and passer. 

- 🟢 **Elite playmaker**

The numbers speak for themselves - 1st in Box Creation(17.9), 3rd in AST%(45.3%), 4th in Assists/game(8.7), 7th in Backpicks Passer Rating(8.3) among players w/ 1500MP, 2.07 AST/TO-ratio. Team-wise, the Dallas offense laps the rest of the NBA *^((+6.3 rORTG, ~3 points better than 2nd-ranked Rockets' +3.4 rORTG)^)* and is [one of the best regular-season offenses *ever*](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/luka-doncic-and-the-mavs-are-pushing-the-limits-of-offensive-efficiency/), improving by +4.7 points when Luka enters the game.

Luka masterfully leverages his considerable scoring threat/'gravity' to earn teammates open looks. [Reading and manipulating defenses like a Jedi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zze-egsuBgE&t=5m21s), Dončić can fire perfectly-placed fastball bouncers and lobs from outside the arc to [rolling Dallas bigs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXxcR-LkZXg&t=1m9s) in the PnR, or whip highlight-reel worthy [cross-court skip-passes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?&v=wJ7TrS1jDdQ) to the Mavericks' armada of shooters. His anticipation is excellent, throwing precise passes into *open space*, out and in front of his teammates, where they can nab it before scrambling defenders do. Luka's [outlet passing](https://streamable.com/z6xej) is great too, and he's skilled at [blending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXxcR-LkZXg&t=3m21s) lobs and interior drop-offs with his dangerous drives to the rim, both in transition and half-court settings. With an offensive wizard at their helm and excellent [spacing](https://i.imgur.com/CCC8uFc.png) spreading opponent defenses thin, it's no wonder the Dallas offense is as fearsome as it's been.

- 🟢 **Uses size and intelligence on defense**

Luka can stay in front of most players with his size and footwork and his offensive IQ allows him to occasionally diagnose certain opponent offensive sets before they happen and even [blow them up completely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8RhyUzW3t0&t=8m). His large frame and good positioning let him add some value as a defensive rebounder as well (8.0 DRB/game, +1.1 team TRB% with Luka on court).

#**The not-as-good**:

- 🔴 **Slightly-negative defender overall**

Dallas have the 17th-ranked defense (+0.2 rDRTG) and are +3.4 points better on defense with Luka *off* the court.  Off-ball, Luka has frequent slips in awareness and can lose track of cutters; he doesn't often make constructive help rotations either. He can be prone to gambling at times, and while this pays off on occasion (1.0 steals/game), it results in open opponent shot attempts more often than not. He's not great at chasing players around the court either and his closeouts aren't always spiffy. On-ball, he's decent at keeping opponent wings in front of him, but he's not much of a shot-deterrent in general - opponents shoot 4.3% better than average on all 2-pointers when Dončić is the closest defender. Defensive metrics generally think of Luka as a slightly-negative defender. 

- 🔴 **Occasionally questionable shot-selection and passes**

Settles for too many long-3s off-the-dribble. His shot selection is vaguely Harden-esque, but he's not as good a shooter as Harden is yet.

Passing-wise, Luka tries a lot of highlight passes that end up missing their mark; he also misses a few advanced reads, though his arsenal is rapidly expanding.

Some of this showed up in the **clutch**, where he wasn't very good this season (-9 net rating, poor scoring efficiency (42ts%)). This was likely reflected in the Mavericks' [team-wide struggles](https://i.imgur.com/sz4FTZv.png)  in the clutch as well. Weirdly, he was better in the clutch during his rookie year (55ts%).

- 🔴 **Has lost some efficiency over the course of the season? (likely related to injuries?)**

Nothing serious, [just something to keep an eye on](https://i.imgur.com/2vz2y3z.png). 

- 🔴 **Maybe overly ball-dominant, questionable fit next to other high-usage stars?**

(Nitpicking.)

Dončić is an elite offensive quarterback, as previously mentioned, which definitely adds value when paired next to better teammates. However, his highly-limited catch-and-shoot game this season *^((1.3 C&S 3PA, 26.9 3P% on catch-and-shoot 3s)^)* and subpar defense put a cap on his **scaleability**.

Nonetheless, the Mavericks DO have one of the best offenses *ever* right now. Fitting next to other superstars becomes MUCH less of a concern when you already have a high-level floor-spacing secondary-scorer big-man PnR/PnP-partner in Kristaps Porzingis, and more importantly, when your team is already this dominant offensively. 

- 🔴 **Minor durability concerns**

Luka has had a [smattering](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/luka-doncic-player-injuries) of minor injuries over his NBA career so far, causing him to miss nearly a fifth of his games this season (13/67).

**In a nutshell**: 22 y/o, Boston Celtics PF/SF, 6-8, 204lb, All-NBA Candidate. **Stats:** 23.6/7.1/2.9/1.4/0.9 with 2.2 TOVs on 44.8/39.8/80.6 shooting splits (56.2 TS%), 59 games played. ***Nerd stats:*** *28.6% Usage, +11.5 On/Off, +4.4 PIPM ^((9th)^) , +5.2 RAPTOR ^((12th)^) , +3.0 BPM (Backpicks) ^((27th)^) , +3.9 BPM (BBRef) ^((19th)^) , +3.63 RPM ^((14th)^)* . 

#**The good**:

- 🟢 **Very solid scorer** (24.7 points per 75, on -0.2 rTS%), **who underwent a mid-season superstar scoring leap**

In the final 25-ish games before the NBA suspended its season, something happened that sent shockwaves throughout Celtics Nation and the rest of the Eastern Conference .... [Jayson Tatum's beard finally connected](https://twitter.com/jaytatum0/status/1243037828101128192). 

Something else also happened, though: Tatum significantly ramped up his scoring in his final 23 games, averaging **27.9 ppg on 61.1 TS%** **^((+4.7 rTS%, 49/46/75 splits)^)**, up from 20.8 ppg on 52.6 TS% ^((-3.8 rTS%)^) in his 36 games prior. 

The key to Tatum's rapid ascension lay in his decidedly-increased confidence and accuracy from the 3-point stripe ^((6.5 3PM, 35 FG% ➡️ 8.1 3PM, 45.4 FG%)^) , which opened up driving lanes for Tatum to attack the rim much more aggressively, finishing quite well there (59 Rim-FG%), often using his spin move and a combination of athleticism, long strides, and footwork to shake defenders. He's also [drawing many more fouls](https://i.imgur.com/82O2slk.png) as a result of his increased assertiveness in the paint ^((3.9 ➡️ 6.0 FTA)^) . 

[Relevant chart by The Ringer](https://i.imgur.com/ABft81H.png): Jayson's [ISO](https://stats.nba.com/players/isolation/) game is solid *^((0.99 PPP-73rd percentile efficiency, ranked 9th in volume)^)* and he's stunningly efficient in the [PnR](https://stats.nba.com/players/ball-handler/#!?sort=PERCENTILE&dir=1&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&CF=FGA*GE*250&PerMode=Totals) *^((5th in efficiency among high-volume PnR ball-handlers)^)* . 

Some regression is likely, and JT will still need to show whether he can maintain this type of production over a full season, as well in the playoffs, where he had a brilliant rookie campaign and a more uneven sophomore one, but early returns on Superstar Tatum have been highly promising.

- 🟢 **Elite volume-shooter**

*40 3P% overall, 45 3P% on over 8 3PA/game in final 23 games.*

Tatum's shot selection is a major driving force for his breakout this year. Veering away slightly from the long-twos he was perhaps overly-fond of last season (midrange attempts now comprise about 20% of his total shots, down from 30% last season), Jayson has started to nail 3-pointers this season at a deadly rate on inflated volume. 

Considering his accuracy, volume,   as well as the [type and difficulty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lcrPU4YsrY&t=1m56s) of 3s that he's taking ([side-steps, stepbacks,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVaqLd4TdCU) quick pullups, transition, shuffle-outs, using screens), Tatum is [one of the best](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&match=single&type=totals&per_minute_base=36&per_poss_base=100&season_start=1&season_end=-1&lg_id=NBA&age_min=0&age_max=99&is_playoffs=N&height_min=0&height_max=99&year_min=2020&year_max=2020&birth_country_is=Y&as_comp=gt&as_val=0&pos_is_g=Y&pos_is_gf=Y&pos_is_f=Y&pos_is_fg=Y&pos_is_fc=Y&pos_is_c=Y&pos_is_cf=Y&c1stat=g&c1comp=gt&c1val=30&c2stat=fg3a_per_g&c2comp=gt&c2val=7&c3stat=fg3_pct&c3comp=gt&c3val=38&order_by=fg3_pct) volume-shooters in the NBA. 

Jayson is comfortable either taking 3s in the flow of the Celtics' egalitarian offense *^((39 FG% on catch-and-shoot 3s, 2.5 3PA/game)^)*, or, when he's on the ball, blending several smooth dribble moves together (between-the-legs, crossovers) with stepbacks and sidesteps to create space for his lethal pullup-3 ^(*(****elite 40 FG% on pullup 3s,*** *4.5 3PA/game*)^) .

- 🟢  **Passable passer**

Averaging 3.1 assists per game in his final 23 games (1.4:1 AST/TO ratio, 4.1 Passer Rating, 5.6 Box Creation), Tatum is steadily gaining more experience reading the defense in the pick-and-roll this year- he's gotten better at bouncing/lobbing to the roll man and kicking out to open shooters when doubled. His relatively light playmaking load and decent ball-protection also mean that his turnovers are on the lower end for a high-usage star (2.2 turnovers/game).

- 🟢 **Excellent perimeter defender**

Switchable, moves his feet well, extremely active off-ball. Boston has a top-4 defense (-3.6 rDRTG), and is [+4.3 points better defensively](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/tatumja01/on-off/2020) with Tatum on the court. Prior to his superstar leap, he was [arguably more impactful on defense than offense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdr3h7YvkSE&t=6m10s). On ball, he's guarded [positions 1 through 4 at least 18.4% of the time each](https://i.imgur.com/ToPVjw8.png), with both the cat quickness and footwork to keep up with speedy guards like Westbrook and the size and length (6-8 with 6-11 wingspan) to guard larger wings/quicker bigs like Kawhi/AD. He uses his length and leg speed to bother shooters well on closeouts or in man situations. Players that Tatum defend shoot [almost 2% worse overall](https://stats.nba.com/player/1628369/defense-dash/). 

Off the ball, Tatum is highly disruptive and effective, with a knack for being in the right place at the right time. He has a gift for tracking ball-handlers' eyes, often helping off his man and straying into the paint to deter rim attempts (0.9 blocks/game) and play the passing lanes well (top 20 in steals and deflections). Tatum is especially destructive in the elbows and foul-line area, timing help rotations perfectly to force turnovers and being long enough to disrupt kickouts to shooters following his help.

- 🟢 **Durable**

Tatum has rarely been injured so far.

#**The not-as-good:**

- 🔴 **Subpar playmaker**

Tatum is still far from a high-level playmaker. He sometimes still has his blinders on when pursuing his own score, missing open teammates on occasion, an ailment that has plagued several talented scorers over the years. Considering his PnR scoring efficiency, he could maybe try to throw the skip pass to weakside shooters more often when their man helps off of them, or incorporate no-looks / use his eyes to manipulate defenders and create open looks for teammates. 

However, his shot selection and decision-making on the ball *has* improved markedly from his sophomore year - fewer midrange and more 3P attempts, for example, and he's fantastic at carrying out Brad Stevens' offensive scheme: the Celtics have the 5th-ranked offense (+2.5 rORTG), which improves by a lofty +7.2 points with Tatum on the court. 

Double-teams and traps will be sent at Jayson with increasing regularity as his scoring game gains more notoriety, though, so learning to pick apart defenses with his vision will be essential if JT wishes to become a top-10-level offensive player in the future.

- 🔴 **Some areas of scoring**

Despite his Kobe-esque reputation amongst certain fans, Jayson's [midrange scoring](https://stats.nba.com/player/1628369/shooting/) isn't particularly accurate at the moment. Amusingly, he's actually shooting better from 3-point territory *^((40 FG%, 420 attempts)^)* than from midrange *^((38 FG%, 181 attempts)^)*. His fadeaways *^((39.8 FG%, 103 attempts)^)*, while flashy, haven't been very efficient. 

Moreover, Tatum isn't especially effective in the non-restricted area of the paint *^((37.2 FG%, 157 attempts)^)* either -  his floaters, for example, aren't very accurate *^((36 FG%, 80 attempts)^)*. 

However, having a diverse arsenal like this still adds value to his overall scoring versatility, so it's important for Jayson to keep attempting and improving on these types of shots in order to keep defenses honest. Opportunities to take these shots in-game will become increasingly available to Tatum in the future as defenders will often try to run him off the line, wary of his superb 3-point stroke.

Finally, Tatum's finishing in the paint/restricted area is 'only' around league-average for a forward ^((59.3 FG%)^). He could add some bulk, perhaps, to score through contact better, which could also boost his foul-drawing rates. 

- 🔴 **Some areas of defense**

Jayson can be guilty of over-helping occasionally or striking out while playing the passing lanes and losing track of his man, leading to some open 3s or cuts to the rim. His closeouts aren't always the cleanest. His man defense also doesn't extend to 5s just yet ([spends only 7.2% of his possessions guarding centers](https://i.imgur.com/aNz1YKL.png)), as he lacks the mass required to bang with monsters in the post consistently, though he has the length and athleticism to hold his own in a pinch or on a switch. Tatum also doesn't have too much influence as a rim-protector at the moment. 

Take these with several pinches of salt, but advanced metrics' have varying mileage re: his overall defensive impact, ranging from elite to just very good: he's 8th in [defensive win-shares](http://bkref.com/tiny/4Qif2), 12th in LA-DRAPM, 26th in D-RPM, 38th in D-PIPM, 52nd in D-RAPTOR, and 55th in DBPM.

1047,52,Best All Star Game Ever,"This is the only time I've ever stayed awake through the entirety of the All Star game. The players want to win the game. Sure the first few quarters had the typical ole defense. But the intensity in the 4th was amazing. Seeing the best players in the world actually play like it's a playoff game is what I've been waiting to see. We got a little bit of everything: crazy awesome plays for 3 quarters, hard playoff style basketball to finish the game, minimal commercials, children's charities win no matter what, the half time show was awesome, the Kobe tributes were perfect. The only way it gets better is if they would open it with the national anthem (yikes). I love basketball. I loved this all star game. This is how you keep people interested. Good job NBA.",nbadiscussion
1048,53,"Which NBA Finals series, if the outcome changes, affects the history of the league most drastically?","To me, it’s the 2013 Finals by a pretty wide margin.

We were one Ray Allen miss away from....

- Duncan getting his sixth championship, likely elevates him to be considered by most to be a top 5 player all time. 

- LeBron James’ legacy would be severely impacted with a loss here his Finals record drops to 2-7. Consideration for him in the GOAT debate drops significantly. 

- Wade ends his career with 2 rings instead of 3.

- The Big 3 Heat era is probably remembered much differently by history. As they would’ve gone just 1-3 in Finals after vowing to win not five, not six, not seven, etc. 

- Pop goes 6-0 on his Finals record. 

- Kawhi adds another Finals win- giving him 3 rings now. 


What do you think is the NBA Finals series that would change history the most of the outcome was changed?",nbadiscussion
1049,54,"The Sixers have announced Shake Milton as their starting PG, sliding Ben Simmons at PF. Can anyone give an overview on Milton’s play style?","I’ve watched a full play clip on Milton’s game against the Lakers, and here are a few takeaways I’ve gotten:

- great catch and shoot
- doesn’t seem to be a natural point guard. makes easy reads such as mismatches and kick outs, but also prone to sloppy mistakes
- decent handles. doesn’t seem to be able to be relied on as a shot creator/isolation scorer.
- decent P&R point, not an insanely quick penetrator but quick enough to score off of defensive lapses
- strong finisher
 

Any thoughts?",nbadiscussion
1050,55,Lakers' wing Kyle Kuzma is shooting 44.4% from distance since the NBA restart. I went through the film and detailed key jump shot improvements potentially underlying that change.,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FFg0wbRMMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FFg0wbRMMs)

Hey everyone - in this 3 min video analysis, I took a deeper look at Lakers’ wing Kyle Kuzma’s jump shot since the NBA restart and key improvements that may underlie his shooting progress (44.4% from 3 since coming back). Thanks to the mods for letting me post.

Here’s a table of contents, header (sub-headings):

\- 0:00 Intro

\- 0:37 Example #1 (Body positioning, stable base, movement synergy, balanced landing)

\- 1:32 Example #2 (Rhythm & balance, step back, jump stop off the dribble, hop step on the catch)

\- 2:01 Example #3 (Shot form, set point, shot flow)

\- 2:33 Key movement science lesson

\- 3:06 Outro

For those at work or the hard of hearing, I've transcribed subtitles on YouTube so sound isn't required.

Summary: Kuz has hit 44.4% of his 3's since the NBA restart began and although a small sample size of 36 attempts, I attempted to look for key improvements/characteristics that he changed which may hint at sustained success. The first example is a clip coming off a double down screen to catch and shoot, the second example is multiple clips that show how he has improved his rhythm and balance especially by priming his jumper with different setup moves, the third example looks at his set point and shot flow compared to his rookie season and what he showed over the summer. Lastly, I briefly explained how Kuz's changes are a key lesson for the realities of movement science and how to teach/approach long-standing movement changes.

1051,56,I wrote a program that takes a single season from a particular player and finds the most statistically comparable season by another player. I've used it to look at how a few players have evolved over time.,"My methodology is, admittedly, pretty unscientific. I haven't yet refined the comparison process. Right now, the program takes the [per-game stats of every player in a given season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1980_per_game.html) from 1980 to 2020 (I started with the introduction of the three-point line). A single season by a particular player is selected, and a range of years in which the most comparable player is to be found is selected. The comparison is simply an average of the percent difference between all of the stats in that table for each player. So, for instance, if I ask for the most comparable season to Kawhi Leonard's 2019 campaign between 2000 and 2010, I get this output:

    Your Player:
    2019 season
    Kawhi Leonard - TOR - 27 - SF
    GP: 60, GS: 60, MPG: 34.0
    FG/G: 9.3, FGA/G: 18.8, FG%: 0.496
    3P/G: 1.9, 3PA/G: 5.0, 3P%: 0.371
    2P/G: 7.5, 2PA/G: 13.8, 2P%: 0.542
    eFG%: 0.546
    FT/G: 6.1, FTA/G: 7.1, FT%: 0.854
    ORB/G1.3, DRB/G: 6.0, TRB/G: 7.3
    AST/G: 3.3, STL/G: 1.8, BLK/G: 0.4
    TOV/G: 2.0, PF/G1.5
    PTS/G: 26.6
    Most similar player in specified year range:
    Average statistical deviation: 0.16473550470690823
    2007 season
    Vince Carter - NJN - 30 - SG
    GP: 82, GS: 82, MPG: 38.1
    FG/G: 8.9, FGA/G: 19.5, FG%: 0.454
    3P/G: 1.9, 3PA/G: 5.3, 3P%: 0.357
    2P/G: 7.0, 2PA/G: 14.2, 2P%: 0.491
    eFG%: 0.503
    FT/G: 5.6, FTA/G: 7.0, FT%: 0.802
    ORB/G1.4, DRB/G: 4.6, TRB/G: 6.0
    AST/G: 4.8, STL/G: 1.0, BLK/G: 0.4
    TOV/G: 2.6, PF/G3.2
    PTS/G: 25.2

Thus, on average, Kawhi Leonard's 2019 stats are about 16% different than Vince Carter's 2007 stats.

I have weighted all of the stats equally, which probably doesn't make sense. In looking for a comparable player, it probably isn't great to give personal fouls per game the same weight as points per game, for example. This is just a rudimentary version, and I may add functionality to adjust the weights down the road.

Nonetheless, I'm getting some cool results when I put in different seasons by the same player. I ran the program a few different times with active players and searched for comparable seasons between 1980 and 2000, just to try to find cool comparisons to older players. A few of the results I got showcase how some players have evolved.

When I put in LeBron's 2013 season with Miami, I get this:

With 11% deviation, that's a pretty close comparison. When I put in 2020 LeBron, here's what we get:

    Your Player:

From Bird to The Glove. The correlation isn't as strong in this case, but it does seem to reflect James' shift in responsibilities pretty well.

2001 Vince is most like Clyde Drexler, and 2020 Vince is most like Jud Buechler. Certainly showcases his evolution into a role player.

Lastly, I looked at Michael Jordan. I searched for the most comparable player to him between the seasons of 2010 and 2020. Here's 1997 Mike:

1054,59,It is ridiculous how the media changes the definition of MVP and moves the goalposts every single year to suit their narrative. LeBron has absolutely zero case for MVP over Giannis this year.,"Last seasons MVP race was one of the best ever. Giannis was dominant the whole year on both ends of the floor and led his team to a 60 win season. Meanwhile, Harden had one of the beat scoring seasons we’ve ever seen. He dragged a far worse supporting cast from the 14th seed to a top 4 seed in a much more competitive West. In the end, Giannis ultimately won MVP; I personally felt that Harden had a better season, but I accepted that certain voters had a different definition of what the award meant. Giannis was the best player on the best regular season team in the league, and it was nice to see him win MVP.

This season, it looked like we were in for an even better race. Harden was averaging nearly 40 ppg and was even better than last year. Meanwhile, Giannis also took his game to another level and the Bucks looked even more dominant than last years squad. During the first couple months, however, the media and fans were quick to dismiss Harden’s MVP case. Even I was inclined to agree; as strongly as I felt that Harden should have won last year, Giannis was having a better season this year on a better team and I agreed early on that the MVP was his to lose barring a serious injury. 

However, lately there’s been this strong push out of nowhere for LeBron to win MVP over Giannis. I seriously cannot think of a single good reason why LeBron should win over Giannis. He’s having a worse season on a worse team despite getting to play with a better co-star. 

LeBron: 25.7/7.8/**10.6**, 58.1% TS, 25.9 PER

Giannis: **29.6**/**13.7**/5.8, **60.8% **TS, **31.7 **PER

LeBron has been a very good defender this year but Giannis is a DPOY tier defender and is a tier above LeBron. Giannis’s team is better this year. Anthony Davis is far superior to any of Giannis’s teammates. 

The only case for LeBron to win over Giannis is that he is by definition “more valuable” to his team - the argument being that the difference between the Lakers with and without LeBron is greater than the difference between the Bucks with and without Giannis. 

First off, the reason they struggle without LeBron is because the team is literally built to perfectly suit him - he has another top 6 player as his co star and he is surrounded by good shooters who also play great D. 

Second, it’s appalling that the media is moving around the goalposts so much just to crown him MVP. Harden had more value to his team last season than LeBron does this year. He had worse teammates and averaged better stats while carrying his team to a top 4 seed - they were a game away from the 2nd seed. 

Harden last year: **36.1**/6.6/7.5/**2.0**/**0.7**, **61.6% **TS, **30.6** PER

LeBron this year: 25.7/**7.8**/**10.6**/1.2/0.5, 58.1% TS, 25.9 PER

Harden had a better season and had worse teammates. By every measure, he had more value and had a greater impact on his team winning than LeBron last year.

Harden lost last year’s MVP to Giannis by a good amount. Giannis is having a better season than he did last year and LeBron is having a worse season than Harden did last year. Earlier this season when Harden was averaging 39 ppg and was better than last year, people didn’t even consider him for the award. Why are people even considering LeBron to win MVP?

I understand that some people don’t like Harden that much and that a ton of fans love LeBron. But it’s unacceptable for actual awards voters to base their decisions for such significant awards based off of which player they like more.

1055,60,Why Dirk's 2010-11 Playoff Run Is Arguably The Most Underrated Carry Job In NBA History,"I will be using on/off court ratings to show why Dirk's 2011 postseason run is one of the biggest carry jobs in NBA history.

On/off court ratings are not perfect, as there are many variables at play, e.g. strength of teammates, strength of opponents, coaching strategy/scheme, etc.

However, on/off court ratings, in tandem with box-score statistics, give imo 80% of the picture. The other 20% is defensive value which can really only be determined from game footage.

Most people kind of dismiss Dirk's 2011 legendary run because of his box-score statistics. He didn't have the gaudy blocks like 2003 Duncan or the 40-point triple doubles like 2018 LeBron.

However, his on/off court ratings clearly show his impact went beyond the box-score statistics.

1057,62,Kyle Lowrys pass to OG compared to Jason Kidd over Yao. Kyle was able to be further back then normal due to the bubble,"I wrote this after the game last night and am now seeing some experts/analysts as well as KOC bring it up

The bubble court’s scorers table and benches are further from the court then a normal court.Kyle was able to back away from the sideline so that Tacko wasn’t all he could see 

Similar to Jason Kidd with Yao (https://youtu.be/1-Ez0ph2ESA) where Yao  is right on top of kidd, it’s about a half a second and you need to get it over a 7’6+ monster. JKidd was amazing and made the pass perfectly.

With Kyle/ tacko (https://streamable.com/zv5190 ) he was able to be a couple feet further back than he normally would have been and it allowed him to get the pass off clean 
(I think this one is cooler however because he hit OG right in the pocket from 40 feet away for the three over a lob to the rim to save a series)

1058,63,Having a 1-on-1 tournament during All-Star weekend is an amazing idea and I’m surprised it hasn’t gained more traction,"All the other suggestions for improving All-Star weekend (mid season tournament, etc.) are all incredibly complicated and controversial. There’s so many different factors that could get in the way and no clear single way that it has been suggested to be implemented. 

Instead of forcing the idea of a mid season tournament, the NBA should just implement a 1-on-1 tournament at All Star Weekend. It would be similar to the 3pt contest/dunk contest where instead of having a representative from each team, the league decides on 16 players to compete in the tournament. Players would have the option to decline, obviously. The structure would be simple, just a 4 round bracket to determine the winner. There would be different classes (Guard/Wing/Big) so we wouldn’t have to see a center on a guard or something of that variety. 

There is really no reason why the league shouldn’t do it. The only “issue” is that the very best superstars wouldn’t participate with the risk of humiliation from losing, but even the dunk contest faces that issue. But even if Harden/Kawhi/etc don’t participate, a 1v1 tourney with lower tier stars would still be insane to watch. Imagine a bracket with guys like Lou Will, Trae Young, etc. And i’m sure certain superstars would love the opportunity and embrace it. Imagine if we got to watch Embiid and KAT go at it 1 on 1. 

I legitimately see no reason why the league shouldn’t implement this idea. Thoughts?",nbadiscussion

CP3 does most of his damage from the midrange, where he's been smoking hot this season, sinking an excellent 52% of his middies, and making a blistering [62% of his pullup twos](https://stats.nba.com/players/shots-general/?Season=2019-20&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&GeneralRange=Pullups&sort=FG2A&dir=1&Period=4) in the 4th quarter.

- - **The less clutch**: If the Thunder have been clutch, the **Mavericks** have been the opposite. They have the 5th-best net rating and SRS (simple rating system) in the league, but 'only' the 13th-best record. They're [14-21 in clutch situations (.400 win %)](https://stats.nba.com/teams/clutch-traditional/?sort=W_PCT&dir=-1), which ranks 22nd, by far the worst of any above-.500 team (the next worst 'good' team are the Grizzlies, who have a solid 52% win rate in clutch situations). Their [fearsome offense](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/luka-doncic-and-the-mavs-are-pushing-the-limits-of-offensive-efficiency/), which ranks best in the league by some distance [(115.8)](https://stats.nba.com/teams/advanced/?sort=OFF_RATING&dir=-1), shrinks to a ghastly [*93.9*](https://stats.nba.com/teams/clutch-advanced/?sort=OFF_RATING&dir=1) in the clutch, which is 2nd-worst among all teams. Their ceiling as a team is clearly sky-high, but their youth is also apparent with their troubles late in the 4th.

---

- -  **Dynamic Duo**: Harden (34.4ppg) and Westbrook (27.5ppg) are now the top-scoring duo (combining for 61.9ppg) in the modern NBA, handily beating out 02-03 Shaq and Kobe (57.5ppg) for the number-one spot. I say *modern* because during one outlier season in the pace-inflated days of yore, Wilt Chamberlain (50.4ppg) and Paul Arizin (21.9ppg) combined in 1962 for 72.3ppg.

---

- - **The Importance of Spacing**: Ever since Clint Capela played his last game in a Rockets uniform, Russell Westbrook has exploded as a scorer, averaging 31.0 ppg on 57.5 TS%, up from 26.3ppg on 52.6 TS%. Meanwhile, teammate and fellow MVP James Harden has tapered down his own scoring rate to accomodate for Russ, scoring ""only"" 31.0 ppg since 1/31/20, down from 35.7 ppg prior to that (his efficiency remains unchanged, ~61-62TS%).

---

- - **""Take me out, coach""**: Giannis's 30.9 Minutes Per Game (MPG) would be by far the fewest minutes an MVP would have averaged were he to win the award - the next highest was Curry in 2015-16 (his unanimous season), when he averaged 32.7 MPG. **Perhaps most incredibly, Giannis is averaging fewer minutes than Sixth Man of the Year favourite Dennis Dennis Schröder (30.9 MPG).** Wow.

---

- - **""Take me out, coach"", part II**: Speaking of Minutes, fellow MVP candidate LeBron James's **34.9** MPG this year would be a new career-low. His previous career-low was 35.2 MPG, set *last* season. His career-*high* is 42.5 MPG, set in the 2005-06 season, when James finished 2nd in MVP voting to Steve Nash, averaging 31/7/7 in his 3rd season in the league.

- - **A pretty good team**: [I've talked before](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/g2w1i7/the_201920_bucks_have_been_one_of_the_best/) on how dominant the Bucks' defense this year has been, so here's a very short snippet on how dominant they have been just *in general*. --- [**SRS**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/tiny.fcgi?id=V4hH2) is a team rating system that takes into account average point differential (~net rating) and strength of schedule. The top 6 teams ever, by this metric, are the '71 Bucks, '96 Bulls, '72 Lakers, '17 Warriors, '97 Bulls, and the '72 Bucks. The 2019-20 Milwaukee Bucks are currently 7th, with an SRS of 10.44. Who's 8th? The 73-win Warriors. (If you're curious, this year's Lakers are 44th, with a 7.75 SRS. Last year's Bucks are closer to this year's Lakers SRS-wise, ranked 30th with an SRS of 8.04.)

---

- - **7-foot Ray Allen**: Karl-Anthony Towns, the Timberwolves' young star big, has just had the best 3-point shooting season by a center in NBA history, [taking into account volume and efficiency](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&match=single&type=per_game&per_minute_base=36&per_poss_base=100&season_start=1&season_end=-1&lg_id=NBA&age_min=0&age_max=99&is_playoffs=N&height_min=0&height_max=99&birth_country_is=Y&as_comp=gt&as_val=0&pos_is_fc=Y&pos_is_c=Y&pos_is_cf=Y&c1stat=fg3a_per_g&c1comp=gt&c1val=3.5&c2stat=fg3_pct&c2comp=gt&c2val=38&order_by=fg3a_per_g) - he's shot 41.2% from 3 on 7.9 attempts per game this season. (For reference, Klay Thompson, from 2015-2019, averaged 42.3% from 3 on 7.7 attempts per game.) The only players to shoot more accurately than Towns on at least as many attempts this year were Duncan Robinson (44.5%, 8.4) and Dāvis Bertāns (42.4%, 8.7). KAT's shooting is in rarefied air. Unfortunately for his All-Star/All-NBA prospects, he missed 28 games with injuries, but he was incredible during the 35 games he did play in.

---

- - **LeDefense**: The 2019-20 Lakers are currently 3rd in defensive rating, with a 105.6 Defensive Rating (DRTG), 4.8 points better than league average (i.e. a -4.8 relative DRTG, or rDRTG). This can mostly be attributed to Defensive Player of the Year (DPOY) candidate Anthony Davis, but some credit should also go to excellent defensive-minded coach Frank Vogel, and to LeBron himself for being an excellent team defender, communicating switches and cleaning up mistakes with smart rotations. This is only the **2nd time** a LeBron team has finished top 3 in defensive rating. The only other time was in 2008-09, when the Cavs finished 3rd, with an rDRTG of -5.9, and LeBron accordingly finished 2nd in DPOY voting. The 2012-12 Heat, where LeBron again finished 2nd in DPOY voting, finished 9th in DRTG, with a -2.2 rDRTG.

---

- - **""That f---ing Tatum boomed me."" LeBron added**: Jayson Tatum, the 22-year-old Boston Celtics youngster, broke out as a superstar during the 2nd-half of the 2019-20 season, expanding on the highly encouraging flashes he'd shown during his rookie playoffs (19/4/3 on 58TS%). In his last 23 games, Tatum has averaged 28/7/3 on 49/46/75 shooting (61.1 TS%, +4.7 rTS%), leading Boston to a 15-8 record (53-win pace). He attacked the rim with more vigor (6.0 FTA/game, up from 3.9 prior) and rained highly accurate pull-up jumpers from beyond the arc (8.1 3PA/game on 46 3P%, up from 6.5 3PA and 35 3P% prior), with the increased defensive attention he received as a result of this unprecedented offensive assault enabling him to show flashes of playmaking in the pick-and-roll, or simply make smart reads out of double-teams. Now, is some regression expected? Certainly. Is this still extremely promising for the Celtics' future? Absolutely. (Some good content on Tatum's ascendance - [538](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-jayson-tatum-changed-his-game-and-became-a-star/), [SB Nation](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/2/19/21142203/boston-celtics-nba-championship-case-contender-jayson-tatum), [Ringer's KOC](https://www.theringer.com/video/2020/3/7/21168583/how-jayson-tatum-became-a-superstar))

- - **♪Clap your hands, everybody♪**: The Philadelphia 76ers have definitely had one of the most *interesting* seasons in the league. While they're safely in the playoffs, their offense remains a hot mess (17th in ORTG), leaning heavily on their defense (6th in DRTG) to lead them to 6th in the East, a far cry from the number 1 seed they were expected to challenge for before the season started. At their best, they have seemed near unstoppable, like when they smoked the aforementioned league-leading Milwaukee Bucks off the floor during their Christmas Day matchup, with Embiid holding probable-MVP Giannis to his worst game of the season while their shooters broke open the Bucks' heralded defense to the tune of 21 3-pointers. At their worst, their offense is barely functional, shrinking against stronger defensive sides with their clunky spacing and inconsistent shot creation. Losing Jimmy Butler has contributed to the latter, while Landry Shamet and especially JJ Redick leaving has essentially ended the Sixers' capable former JJ/Embiid Dribble-Handoff driven half-court offense. PnR/PnP/DHO specialist versatile big Al Horford has turned in a career-worst season, struggling in the catch-and-shoot role the Sixers have had to play him in due to their lack of shooting elsewhere. Tobias Harris has been inconsistent. Embiid has inexplicably tapered down his scoring load this season, alongside missing his usual 20 games. Simmons has been exceptional on defense but has yet to break through on offense. Perhaps nothing sums up the Sixers chaotic season better than their **ridiculously-lopsided home/away record**: At home, the Sixers are an incredible, league-leading 27-2 (93% win-%, or a 76-win pace); when playing away, the Sixers are a ghastly 10-24 (29% win-%, or a 24-win pace). Home Sixers would be the favourite for the title, while Away Sixers are a throwback to the Hinkie era. For Sixers fans like myself, endlessly frustrating; for everyone else, it's likely been infinitely entertaining.

---

- - **DAME TIME ⌚**: Damian Lillard has just had his best statistical offensive season ever, with 28.9 points and 7.3 assists per game on 46/39/89 shooting (61.9 TS%, +5.5 rTS%), putting up career highs in scoring, assists, FG%, 3P%, 3PA, eFG%, TS%, PER, and BPM. For the first time in his career, he's [leading the entire league in offensive box-plus-minus and offensive win shares](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/lillada01.html#all_advanced), as he tries to drag a depleted Blazers squad to the playoffs.  (This is the first time in 3 seasons, by the way, that James Harden is not leading the league in those categories, even as he scores 34.4 ppg on 62TS% and dishes 7.4 apg.) Lillard's incredible floor-raising efforts have nearly worked - the Blazers are top 10 in offensive rating and are +7.7 points better on offense with Dame on the court. It's their defense that's letting them down, which, after losing key wing defenders in free agency (Aminu, Harkless) and losing key defensive bigs to injury (Nurkic, Collins), is now anchored by a hapless defensive frontcourt of [Hassan Whiteside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbGnvk23odA) and Carmelo Anthony. The Blazers are [27th in the league](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020.html#all_misc_stats) in defensive rating, worse than the Hornets, Knicks, Pistons, Wolves, and the 15-win Warriors. Perhaps nothing sums up Lillard's and the Blazers' season better than Dame's two 60-point games. )Yes, Dame had 2 60-point games this season.) One came in a 5-point win against the aforementioned 15-win Warriors. One came in a 4-point loss to the Nets. With the Blazers' seemingly likely to miss the playoffs, Lillard's season will likely also be lost to time, but it would be wrong to not mention how good he's played on here, at least.

- - **Bucket-getters**: You've probably heard by now that the NBA has had a scoring explosion of sorts these past few years, but [this season has been special](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/stats?category=SCORING). Not only do the [Dallas Mavericks have the highest raw offensive rating ever](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/luka-doncic-and-the-mavs-are-pushing-the-limits-of-offensive-efficiency/), individual scorers have also bloomed like never before. There are 10 players this season averaging above 26ppg (including Booker, AD, Kawhi, Westbrook), 6 players averaging above 28ppg (including Doncic's 28.7ppg and Lillard's 28.9ppg), 4 players averaging over 29ppg (including Giannis and Trae, each averaging 29.6ppg), and 2 players averaging over 30ppg (Beal - 30.5ppg, Harden - 34.4ppg). The type of teams these high-scoring stars are on range from one of the best regular season teams ever (Giannis, on the Bucks), to playoff locks (Doncic's Mavs, Harden's Rockets), to fringe playoff sides (Booker's Suns, Lillard's Blazers, Beal's Wizards), to lottery teams (Trae on the Hawks). Even as recently as [last season](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/stats?season=2018&category=SCORING&group=1&sort=3&time=0&pos=0&team=0&qual=1&sortOrder=0&opp=0), there were only *2* players averaging 28ppg - Paul George (28.0ppg) and Harden (36.1ppg). One of the very few comparable seasons to this year in recent history is the 2005-06 season, which famously featured Kobe averaging 35, but also had: 10 players averaging >25ppg, 4 players averaging >29ppg, and *3 players averaging >31ppg* - LeBron (31.4ppg), Iverson (33.0ppg), and Kobe (35.4ppg).

- - ***""♪I love to have a beer with Duncan♪""***: No, not the greatest power-forward in NBA history. We're talking about **Miami Heat's undrafted 25 y/o SF Duncan Robinson**, who was blistering hot from 3 this year, making a scorching 44.8% of his 8.4 3-point attempts per game. Before the stoppage, he was on pace to hit more than 300 3s this season, a feat accomplished only by Stephen Curry and James Harden. His [increase of 223 3s from season-to-season](https://i.imgur.com/lQXEz0R.png) is tied with George McCould (1994-96) for the largest in NBA history, and he will likely add to this count when the season resumes. In terms of [made 3s per game](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&match=single&type=totals&per_minute_base=36&per_poss_base=100&season_start=1&season_end=-1&lg_id=NBA&age_min=0&age_max=99&is_playoffs=N&height_min=0&height_max=99&birth_country_is=Y&as_comp=gt&as_val=0&pos_is_g=Y&pos_is_gf=Y&pos_is_f=Y&pos_is_fg=Y&pos_is_fc=Y&pos_is_c=Y&pos_is_cf=Y&c2stat=fg3a&c2comp=gt&c2val=8&c4stat=fg3&c4comp=gt&c4val=240&order_by=fg3_per_g), Robinson is in rarefied air, with only Curry, Harden, Hield, and George ahead of him, and of that group, [only Curry and Robinson](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&match=single&type=totals&per_minute_base=36&per_poss_base=100&season_start=1&season_end=-1&lg_id=NBA&age_min=0&age_max=99&is_playoffs=N&height_min=0&height_max=99&birth_country_is=Y&as_comp=gt&as_val=0&pos_is_g=Y&pos_is_gf=Y&pos_is_f=Y&pos_is_fg=Y&pos_is_fc=Y&pos_is_c=Y&pos_is_cf=Y&c2stat=fg3a&c2comp=gt&c2val=8&c3stat=fg3_pct&c3comp=gt&c3val=40&c4stat=fg3&c4comp=gt&c4val=240&order_by=fg3_per_g) shoot over 40% from 3, and only Curry's [2013 season and game-breaking 2016 season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&match=single&type=totals&per_minute_base=36&per_poss_base=100&season_start=1&season_end=-1&lg_id=NBA&age_min=0&age_max=99&is_playoffs=N&height_min=0&height_max=99&birth_country_is=Y&as_comp=gt&as_val=0&pos_is_g=Y&pos_is_gf=Y&pos_is_f=Y&pos_is_fg=Y&pos_is_fc=Y&pos_is_c=Y&pos_is_cf=Y&c2stat=fg3a&c2comp=gt&c2val=8&c3stat=fg3_pct&c3comp=gt&c3val=40&c4stat=fg3&c4comp=gt&c4val=240&order_by=fg3_pct) are ahead of Robinson in efficiency. These aren't just empty shooting numbers, either, if such a thing is even possible - as [SB Nation's Ricky O'Donnell puts it](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/3/6/21166068/duncan-robinson-miami-heat-three-point-shooting-impact-stats-highlights) puts it, ""Robinson leads the Heat in net-rating at +7.2 when he’s in the game. The Heat’s offense — currently No. 7 in the NBA — jumps up to No. 2 when he’s on the floor. Robinson is also a staple in most of the Heat’s top lineups. He’s in three of Miami’s four best lineups and in seven of the top 11. Miami has also has the top halfcourt offense in the league since the NBA All-Star break. Robinson’s constant motion and shooting ability has its finger prints all over that, too."" Miami have unearthed a gem, and someone likely to remain a crucial component of their offense for years to come.

- - **Ultimate Moreyball** - You have probably heard that 2013 7th-pick Ben McLemore has made a heartwarming return to NBA relevance, as the newest addition the Houston Rockets's armada of shooters. He's been capable in his role, scoring 9.8 points per game on excellent 40% 3P shooting (solid 6.2 attempts/game), athletic finishes at the rim, and passable defense. What you may not have heard is that McLemore's [NBA stats shooting page](https://stats.nba.com/player/203463/shooting/) reads like a Daryl Morey wet dream come to life: Ben has taken the Moreyball approach of ""only threes, FTs, and layups"" to new and obscene heights - **of his 470 field goal attempts, he has attempted exactly zero midrange shots**. The rest of the Rockets were no slouches in this department either - Covington had 21 midrange attempts, Tucker had 19, House had 13, Gordon had 9, Rivers had 7, and the NBA's soon-to-be 3-time scoring leader James Harden, with 1386 field goal attempts this season, tried *16* midrange shots this season (1.2% of his total attempts), by *far* a new career-low. All this anti-tradition black-magic continues to work for Houston - the Rockets rank 2nd in offensive rating. I am both impressed and horrified.

- - - 

- - **Some breakouts you might have missed** - I might write more on this topic later, but in the meantime- 1) [Orlando's](http://dailydribbledrive.blogspot.com/2019/12/jonathan-isaac-unicorn-on-defensive-end.html) young [**Jonathan Isaac**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/i/isaacjo01.html) has broken out as a [Defensive Player of the Year](https://www.nba.com/magic/magics-minister-defense-vying-all-defense-accolades-20191207) candidate, limited only by an unfortunate injury 32 games in; 2) [Memphis's 20 y/o defensive prodigy **Jaren Jackson Jr**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jacksja02.html) was arguably the [2nd-best shooting big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4fbvX00l6o&feature=youtu.be&t=2m54s) in the league this season, only behind the previously-discussed KAT, shooting 40% on [a wide variety of threes](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/1/15/21065775/jaren-jackson-jr-highlights-memphis-grizzlies-stats-video-unicorn) on 6.3 attempts/game. JJJ's defense is still a work in progress due to his fouling problems, but his offensive game has bloomed, due in large part to his excellent work from behind the arc; 3) Detroit's 24-year-old **Christian Wood** has broken out as a [2-way sweet-shooting big](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/3/10/21172174/christian-wood-detroit-pistons-free-agency) after Andre Drummond was traded, averaging 23/10/2/1/1 on 56/40/77 shooting (*65 TS%*) in his final 14 games; and 4) Chicago's **Kris Dunn**, who I've [posted about before](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/gp58np/kris_dunns_defense/), has quietly been [one of the best defenders in the league this year](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/2/27/21156173/kris-dunn-chicago-bulls-free-agency-contract-qualifying-offer), regardless of position.

- - **OKC's 3-point guard lineup**: A huge reason for OKC's aforementioned elite clutch play has been the delightful, unexpected, and unprecedented success of Coach Billy Donovan's crunch-time 3-PG lineup, with Paul/Schröder/Gilgeous-Alexander playing the 1-3, the eternally-underrated Gallinari at 4, and the ever-solid Steven Adams at 5. There are 536 three-man lineup combinations that have logged at least 200 minutes this season, and [Paul, Schröder, and Gilgeous-Alexander lead all in net rating, outscoring opponents by 26.7 points per 100 possessions](https://stats.nba.com/lineups/advanced/?Season=2019-20&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&CF=MIN*GE*200&sort=NET_RATING&dir=1&GroupQuantity=3), clocking in slightly ahead of the Clippers' potent Beverley/Kawhi/Harrell triumvirate. [This awesome SB Nation article](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/1/9/21057540/oklahoma-city-thunder-chris-paul-shai-gilgeous-alexander) by Michael Pina breaks it down beautifully, but I'll try to include the main points here.  1) CP/SGA/Schröder are all excellent shooters, especially from midrange, which opponent defenses unwisely give up to CP3 and co. in crunch-time. They take advantage of this brilliantly, shooting more midrangers than any other shot type in the 4th quarter, with Oklahoma City’s effective field goal percentage still being a remarkable 58.7 eFG% when all 3 share the floor, which is nearly 3% better than the first-place Milwaukee Bucks. 2) CP/SGA/Schröder are all capable PnR ball-handlers as well, able to hunt mismatches with ruthless efficiency, so this lineup is incredibly rich with capable shot creators and passers. 3) They don't give up anything defensively, with Paul being as solid on defense as he's ever been, Schröder being a pest by hounding ball-handlers, picking them up at 94 feet, SGA's length affording him the ability to guard the post at a passable rate, and Adams stonewalling the rim and gobbling up rebounds. All three guards are all highly switchable, too. The 3-man PG lineup has a defensive rating of 98.6, 3 points better than the Bucks' historic league-leading defense. 4) Gallinari's the most potent shooter on the team, hitting an incredible 41% of his 7.1 3P-attempts/game, and with him being a PF it opens up the floor for the guards to cook from midrange/3 or the paint.

**Interesting games/performances from this season (continued from the last post):**

- - **The Marcus Smart game**: This was a 4-point Celtics loss against the Suns, due to Kemba and Brown being out and Booker doing his [usual damage against the Celtics](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/eqqkm9/devin_booker_against_the_celtics_tonight_391092/), but the show was stolen by [Marcus Smart going insane from 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI58Zf6FY0I), hitting *11 3-pointers*, and finishing with 37/5/8 and 4 steals on 74 TS%. The [20th game in NBA history](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&match=game&is_playoffs=E&age_min=0&age_max=99&season_start=1&season_end=-1&pos_is_g=Y&pos_is_gf=Y&pos_is_f=Y&pos_is_fg=Y&pos_is_fc=Y&pos_is_c=Y&pos_is_cf=Y&c1stat=fg3&c1comp=gt&c1val=11&order_by=pts) to produce 11 3s by a single player has come from none other than former non-shooter Marcus Smart.

- - **Jonathan Isaac near 5x5**: Perhaps no game has exemplified the young Magic big's unicorn-like skillset better than his [13/10/5/4/6 performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ttNXKE9pLM) on 69TS% in a 1-point loss against the Dallas Mavericks.

- - **Rockets-Wizards, October 30 2019**: At the time, both teams were top 5 offenses, and with the Wizards' bottom-ranked defense, this game was always going to be an offensive explosion, and *boy* did it deliver. The final score: 159-158, Rockets win. Harden scored 59/3/9 on 65 TS%, Beal had 46/6/8 on 86 TS%. It went straight down to the wire, with Houston outscoring 47-41 in the 4th to snatch the win. The two teams combined for 317 points in a game that didn't even have a single overtime. o7.

- - **The Raptors just won't die**: This was [one of the most incredible games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcwbxMMtKB0) of the season. The game was all but over with 2:30 left in the third quarter, when Toronto faced a 30-point deficit after a Dwight Powell layup made it 85-55. Nick Nurse and his squad could have just packed it in, but instead, Kyle Lowry and a bunch of reserves went on a 40-10 run to steal the game. They full-court-pressed a surprised Dallas squad (notably, lacking Luka) for the remainder of the game, spurring turnover after turnover, which, combined with some heroic Kyle Lowry heat-checks from deep, capped an improbable 30-point comeback. Watch The Ringer's awesome [recap of the game, here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5GK-5iNRBo).

- - **Indiana hates Ben Simmons**: Another game that went down to the wire, but unlike the high-scoring heroics of the Rockets-Wizards matchup, this contest came down to defense. Specifically, the outstanding late-game defensive work of Philadephia's All-Defensive candidate Ben Simmons, who had [*3 steals in the final 14 seconds*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjxFleEsZHc) to seal a razor-close win against Indiana. [""He's a thief, but in Philly, that's legal!""](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/gp2r9z/ben_simmons_with_3_steals_in_the_final_15_seconds/)

- - **Utah hates Eric Gordon**: The Rockets-Jazz rivalry spans decades, but this latest matchup was never intended to be a contest, with the Rockets' two All-Stars Harden and Westbrook sitting out with rest and/or injury. What Utah couldn't possibly have predicted was Eric Gordon producing his best Harden impersonation yet with 50 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 assists on 64/55/80 shooting, 81.2 TS%, helped by 20-apiece from House and Rivers to comfortably defeat the Jazz *in Utah* despite Mitchell and Bojan each dropping 30. [Incredible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0tLaS_iPrs).

- - **OKC hates the Lakers but that's nothing new**: Much like the previous entry on this list, OKC were expected to bring home a comfortable win with, unusually, both LeBron *and* AD missing the game. However, LA's merry [ragtag bunch of role-players](https://i.imgur.com/rUxDNpd.png), spearheaded by Kyle Kuzma's [36 points on 70 TS%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAfs7q6ej3w) and the much-maligned Rajon Rondo turning back the clock with a near 21-point triple double, responded to adversity with unbelievable hustle and self-belief, bringing home an unlikely [15 point-win](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUfgbhTDT8) against a very solid Thunder side.


- - **Trae Young speaks too soon, and the Heat break some records**: The young Hawks All-Star celebrated and mouthed “it’s over” when Atlanta went up six with 59 seconds left on the Heat in an early December matchup after making a [brilliant pass to Alex Len for an open dunk](https://twitter.com/HawksOnFSSE/status/1204601127481704449). What happened next, well. [You know it already.](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/gtgu4l/highlights_trae_young_says_its_over_the_miami/) In the next 30 seconds, Butler and Robinson hit consecutive threes to tie the game. The Heat trapped Young when he got the ball in the final minute, and his teammates didn't convert their shots. The Heat went 16-0 in the resulting OT, capping off a [22-0 run to win comfortably, 135-121](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWeyNKm0Vqw). Jimmy Butler rubbed salt in the wound on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/B56xiQuhlHB/), but Trae would have the last laugh in their next meeting, dropping 50 points on 75 TS% to bring Atlanta a win. Oh, I forgot to mention: during that first OT matchup, the Heat broke [at least eleven personal and team records](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/e91pe0/the_heathawks_game_saw_a_careerhigh_18_rebounds/), with Butler, Nunn, Bam, and Robinson combining for 120 points, nearly outscoring the Hawks (121) by themselves.

1062,67,"[OC] Carmelo Anthony Hasn’t Changed, He’s Just In a Better Environment","On a late Thursday evening, Woj decided to break NBA Twitter with the announcement that Carmelo Anthony would be joining the Portland Trailblazers. Depleted by injuries to their big men and searching for something different from Mario Hezonja and Anthony Tolliver, a man that was seen as over the hill would be given the opportunity to bail out the team.

Since Carmelo Anthony has been resurrected, surprisingly the Portland Trailblazers have been better with him on the court. The question is…why? Its worth starting with what went wrong before his break.

Carmelo Anthony wasn’t bad with the Oklahoma City Thunder. He shot 42.8% from the field and had an eFG% of 50.5%. Because of the spacing of Billy Donovan’s offense, he often resorted to the catch-and-shoot game with the occasional pull-up jumper from the top of the key, not being able to work in his ability as an isolation scorer as often as he would like. With Steven Adams running high post-low post, the court spacing would be limited based off of Adams’ read on the flow of the offense. 

As his time was winding down with the team, guarding Carmelo inside the arch became a lot easier. Teams would run a soft-man that would double Carmelo as he would go back down and at times, he would take the tough shot.

He wasn’t bad on the Thunder in the regular season—we just remember the play-off series against the Utah Jazz. The series that was Donovan Mitchell’s coming out party later became the series where the world questioned if Carmelo Anthony should still be in the association. In the regular season, Carmelo Anthony did his job at being another offensive skill player for the team—they weren’t bringing him in for defense. The team would have a higher ORtg (+6.7), ORB% (+7.6), DRB% (3.3) and lower turnover% (-0.2) with Melo on the floor versus Melo off the floor.

Unfortunately, in the play-offs, team’s play different. Utah Jazz would develop the counter to Carmelo—a defensive system that would follow Carmelo when he would play for the Rockets—the 2-3 Zone. For most of the series, Carmelo’s mid-range game was limited. The adaption to the zone was to push Carmelo towards the corner—removing another key aspect in his play on the wing—and not giving Melo looks towards the post. When Carmelo couldn’t be the catch-and-shoot player needed, it made sense to remove Anthony from the game but his individual performance was only a small part in what was a terribly coached series from OKC and a beautiful display of basketball from Quin Synder. Carmelo Anthony didn’t change Russell Westbrook missing shots or Paul George’s terrible Game 2 and Game 6. But I digress. 

The stench from said series would follow Melo to Houston.

Carmelo was again, tasked with being a catch-and-shoot man. But unlike his time in Oklahoma City, he never found a grove in the Mike D’Antoni offense. When he was hot, he was hot. It would often come with how the court was being spaced. Being allowed the freedom of isolation or coming off of a screen into a shot was huge for his game. He still would not get the paint looks—due to the style from Harden and Paul—which limited his play once again and where he was able to execute from. The James Harden-Carmelo Anthony dynamic never worked. James Harden would continue to be dominant with the ball and not really give up opportunities to teammates if he felt that he had the ability to create his own shot. He only assisted on 6 of Carmelo Anthony’s shots—which is still a little bit baffling, even in the short time of Carmelo’s tenure with the team.

In his final game in a Rockets’ uniform, he would shoot 1 for 11 from the field against a Westbrook-less Thunder. The 2-3 zone would haunt him again and his time would be up. A team that was looking for a ring didn't see Carmelo as a piece in the puzzle to getting one. They still didn't get one. His good would be overshadowed by the bad and he would wait for someone to be desperate enough to see if Carmelo still had it in him.

Portland was desparate.

Terry Stotts has done a beautiful job of re-introducing Carmelo Anthony into the association. 

We know Carmelo Anthony is known to be a defensive liability but instead of still attempting to force a man defense, the Blazers used a soft-zone. He’s off-ball defense isn’t horrendous and he isn’t going to be exposed by a combine-fiend that would draw him out to the perimeter and slash to the basket on him. He is still an excellent rebounder and anything above that on defense is the cherry on top with his defensive ability.

But in reality, we only want to know about how good his offense is. In Portland, its been good in context. Again, we weren’t expecting Carmelo to come back and suddenly be prime Carmelo. But this is the veteran Carmelo Anthony we were hoping to see.

Terry Stotts deserves most of the credit. Because for the longest time, its only felt partly like Carmelo Anthony’s fault for why he wasn’t able to blossom outside of New York. Let’s start first with the half-court offense. In transition, the team naturally falls into an isolation look. With CJ, Dame and Melo all being able to work, and enjoy working in iso, it only makes sense to do so. 

When the ball is being brought up, Melo will naturally fall to the opposite side, sitting around the wing. If Melo is down the floor first, and the ball is being brought his way, he’ll fall into the low post. This is for a couple of reasons. I like to use the simple analogy of merging onto the high way. Depending on the traffic, the speed of cars in the far right lane and your personal speed, you have to react to make sure that there are no accidents. 

Proper spacing of the floor is key at the beginning of possessions for the Trailblazers. Because of their dynamic guards, and the reliance on said guards, you want to create as much space as possible for CJ and Dame to work. Even if you may have the opportunity to merge onto the highway, you don’t want to risk getting rear-ended by the dude going 70 in a 55 in the right lane—even if at the time, the space may seem available.

Melo’s spacing for the guards creates more opportunities on his end. There are times where he may run into transition early just to be able to get an early post-up and allow for the space to develop around. In this brief example, Pelicans take a look from deep, which allows Anthony to run back on the offensive end. [He immediately set-ups in the post](https://youtu.be/7AaVh6EXtqk?t=154). Because of this immediate presence, it quietly creates space for two players—Simmons who will go wing to baseline and Whiteside, who will come straight down the paint. The Pelicans are forced to foul to stop the free bucket.

 [Every player knows that if they set a screen, there is an opportunity to roll into your own shot](https://youtu.be/MuNp524AZaI?t=300). Because of the ‘stacked one side’ offense run in Portland, Melo is getting a lot more opportunities to set a meaningful screen and open up into his own game, but also with the understanding that at times, he just needs to sit around the perimeter. Its not a complex offense, its a simple yet effective one. [Pretty simple clip](https://youtu.be/cPK3CHcJWec?t=92), Portland brings up the ball and immediately—we see the stack with Skal Labissiere setting up in the paint. As CJ gives the ball to Carmelo on the wing, CJ casually moves away from the ball, Skal leaves his spot in the post and sets the stage for Melo versus Lopez. Its just so simple to realize what is happening—Melo getting a match-up he wants—and it is just so simple to give even a little bit of space for him to do his magic, even if it just leads to a jump shot. 

Another example of spatial awareness,  [CJ not taking the screen](https://youtu.be/QaBlz3wv9_Q?t=85)—with the understanding that it was Carmelo Anthony’s intention to take on Knox. Its an extremely small thing that may go unnoticed but deserves to be appreciated. It’s also a sign of team chemistry.


The system also loves for you to penetrate. We already talked a bit about how the Blazers want space for the guards to work Hassan Whiteside surprisingly does a really good job at spacing out the paint when he is on the court—so that when there is an isolation opportunity, the player can do their thing. Melo and Whiteside actually play well together when manning the front court positions. The statistics don’t show but the things that don’t show up on the stats sheet—such as screens, spacing, box-outs, presence in the post shouldn’t go unnoticed.


Probably the best thing to come from his time in Portland is that he isn’t expected to take three pointers. Only one season before he left New York, he averaged more than 6 three-pointers a game (2012-13). In OKC, he averaged 6.1. In Houston, he averaged 6.4. In Portland, he averages 4.1. Shooting 41% from beyond the arch is a general improvement in the stats but he isn’t being expected to chuck it. He’s been given the go-ahead to be the true Carmelo and work his way into a shot rather than immediately touching a ball and putting up a shot. [It doesn’t mean he still isn’t swearing while getting a rebound, gets down the court and shoots a heat check three over the probable MVP,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXghUGkB_O0) he’s just been a lot better about approaching his shot selection.

His ability to have a mid-range game again—the range where he has the most attempts (79 attempts) has been refreshing. Not being able to execute from said range as well as he used to—shooting just 34.2%—is a brutal reminder that he isn’t as fresh as he once was. However, his willingness to take the shots is forcing teams to react defensively, or how they want to approach their defensive system. 

Carmelo Anthony also struggles struggles with his finishes at the room. [His first step has been too good to not get 2 points on the scoreboard](https://youtu.be/QaBlz3wv9_Q?t=147). Because he is increasing his volume of shots at the rim (roughly +2 attempts per game compared to his time in OKC and Houston), his dip in percentages makes sense. But still, you wouldn’t want him to miss from inside the restricted area. Most of the times, it feels that instead of making a big boy bucket at the basket, he’s searching for the foul. And for he most part, he get’s them. He’s gone from taking 2.0 fouls a game to 3.5 fouls drawn per game. The drawn fouls are leading to a marginal increase in free-throw attempts but still not the amount you would be expecting to see. 

Again, the crazy thing in all of this story is that Carmelo Anthony is only seeing marginal differences in his individual statistics—outside of his three point percentage being higher on fewer attempts. The statistics don’t lie, we aren’t seeing a statistically better Carmelo or much of a different performance. We’re seeing a happy Carmelo and a happy organization.

Stotts is using Carmelo correctly. He’s hiding his weaknesses, which is all you can really ask for from a coach. Because of this, the players you’re paying to lead the team are able to do what they need to do. With Carmelo on the floor versus off the floor, Portland is producing a net +2.2 field goals made, an improved FG% (+0.036) and eFG% (+0.04), and a higher point differential (+4.3). The trio of Anthony, Lillard and McCollum are producing a net +4.6 field goals made, +0.064 FG% and a +0.074 eFG%, a whopping +11.2 points.

Despite what has been a horrendous start to the season, the Carmelo Anthony experiment was a reminder that they’re still an extremely well coached team with talent that is simply getting the injury bug. [Like the John Mayer song, the Portland Trailblazers gave Carmelo Anthony one night and we saw him in a new light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ055hHdxbE). But It doesn’t necessarily mean he’s changed.",nbadiscussion
1063,68,"Got downvoted in r/NBA for posting a long, detailed post...anyone in here want to discuss abandoning FG% for eFG% in this modern 3-point era?","I got downvoted in r/NBA for posting the following. I thought it was worth discussing but maybe that’s not the right place for this:

Throw away FG%. It’s outdated. Eliminate it from contention. In the world of 3 point shooting, FG% is misleading and it’s ruining good basketball discussion.

Let me ask you this: In Football, how useful would it be if the main stat was “on what % of drives does the team score anything (FG OR a touchdown)”? A team could have 100% in this stat and score nothing but field goals but they would lose to a team who only scored on only half of their drives but they were all touchdowns. So why are we putting so much value in to a stat that asks “on what % of drives does a player score (2 or 3) points”? Same thing. I’ll take 40% with mostly 3s over 50% with mostly 2s any day. 

Advanced stats aren’t that hard. Check it out: 

**eFG%** is FG% *except* that it values 3 pointers made at 1.5x because that’s what they’re worth on the scoreboard. 
For example: 4/10 from 3 and 6/10 from 2 are both 12 points. FG% would list the first at 40% and the second at 60%. eFG% would have them both at 60%. 5/10 from the floor with 2 of those 5 makes being 3s would be 60 eFG% as well. 

*Why not just look at FG% and 3P%?!?* - I’ll tell you why. 
Player A: 48 FG% 40 3p% 
Player B: 48 FG% 40 3p%

Just looking at those 2 percentages doesn’t give you the whole story. Suppose Player A takes 90% of his shots from 2 and Player B takes 50% of his shots from 2. Factoring in the 3s at 1.5x would mean Player A has a eFG of 50% (below league average) and Player B has a eFG of 58% (well above league average). Meaning that in 100 shots, Player A would score 100 points and Player B would score 116 (the same as a big man who shoots 58% and never shoots 3s).

But it also matters how *often* a player shoots. A player who has an eFG of 62% but only shoots 5 times a game is nice, but he won’t fuel your offense.

**USG%** is Usage. Simply put: how many of your team’s possessions does this player use? Someone with a 33% usage means that when they’re on the floor, 1/3rd of the team’s possessions end with that player scoring, missing, turning the ball over, or being fouled. 

Using eFG% and USG% together gives us a REALLY good idea of how good of a scorer someone is. Here’s why: the league average eFG in 18-19 was 52.4%. That means to have an above average offense, you want to score *effectively* on more than 52.4% of your possessions as a team (Effectively meaning: adjusted for 3s). Looking at usage and eFG together means we can see what % of a team’s shots a player took and how effective he was with them.

Okay so if a player uses 30% of your team’s possessions and scores at 49 eFG%....the other 70% of the possessions from the other 4 guys need to be REALLY above average to balance him out and raise your team average. On the other hand, if a player takes 30% of your possessions and scores at 58 eFG%, the other guys can be below average and you’d still have an above average offense.

Basically, chuckers hurt and high usage+high efficiency players help. Surprising, huh?

**So let’s put this in to context with some noteworthy 18-19 lines. Remember, league average is 52.4 eFG%:

Harden 
40.5 USG%  54.1 eFG%

Curry
30.4 USG%  60.4 eFG%

Kemba
31.5 USG%  51.1 eFG%

Westbrook
30.9 USG%  46.8 eFG%

Capela
18.2 USG%  64.8 eFG%

Giannis 
32.3 USG%  59.9 eFG%

Donovan Mitchell
31.6 USG%  49.3 eFG%

Deandre Ayton
21.2 USG%  58.8 eFG%

Luka Doncic
30.5 USG%  49.7 eFG%

Buddy Hield
25.1 USG%  56 eFG%**


I promise I’m not using this to shit on anyone, (more goes in to the game than just usage and eFG%)...but if you were trying to *effectively* score on more than 52.4% of your possessions (league average), would you rather have a player who took 31.6% of your team’s shots and effectively scored on 49.3% of them.....or a player who took 25.1% of your team’s shots and effectively scored on 56% of them? A player taking a third of your shots and scoring below league average on those shots digs your efficiency in to a major hole, and you’d have to have everyone else around him shoot above average to dig you out. 

For perspective: 

88-89 Jordan 
32.1 USG%  54.6 eFG% (league avg 48.9 eFG%)

05-06 Kobe
39 USG%  49.1 eFG% (league avg 49 eFG%)

12-13 LeBron
30.4 USG%  60.3 eFG% (league avg 49.6 eFG%)

93-94 Shaq
29 USG%  59.9 eFG% (league avg 48.5 eFG%)

05-06 Dirk
30.2 USG%  51.5 eFG% (league avg 49.6 eFG%)

04-05 Iverson 
35 USG%  45.3 eFG% (league avg 48.2 eFG%)

86-87 Bird
27.5 USG%  55.5 eFG% (league avg 48.8 eFG%)



USG and eFG only look at how often and how effectively a player shoots. There are many other stats that factor in to a good team performance. 

Turnovers mean you can’t score on the possession at all (and might be giving up an easy bucket to the other team). I don’t like Turnovers Per Game because players play different amounts of minutes/possessions. Look at TOper36 or TO% for a number that can compare heavy minute guys to bench players. High Usage + high eFG is great, but if that player is turning the ball over a lot, he’s not as efficient as he appears until you factor in TO%. 

Free Throws matter too. TS% is like eFG% but it factors in FTs as well. I like looking at them separated (2s and 3s happen in the flow of the game and misses can lead to things like rebounds/blocks/assists and FTs can’t) but you might prefer TS%.

Assists help your teammates score and help raise their eFG (and thus your team’s eFG). Again, look at per36 or AST% to compare players more fairly (% will compare more fairly across eras than p36 btw)

Rebounding is important because it gives you a second chance to score off of your miss (or prevents the opposition from scoring off of their miss). Again...per36 or REB% are recommended over RPG.

Blocks are an auto-miss on your opponent’s attempt and lower their eFG%. Again, look at Bp36 or BLK% instead of blocks per game to compare players per minute or possession. Steals give you a free possession and usually an easy shot as well. Again, Sp36 or STL% gives the best comparison.



Once you learn to look at things in a way that accounts for 3s being worth more or accounts for how many shots a player uses then you will start finding some crazy stats that put things in perspective. 

For example:

There are only 2 seasons in NBA history where a player has 32+ USG% and 59+ eFG%: Steph’s unanimous MVP season and Giannis this year. Give those men their props!",nbadiscussion

#1: **Jonathan Isaac, defensive savant**

---

*[Note: Please read this fantastic and highly detailed two-part post by Jonathan Chen, from which I pilfered the vast majority of the clips that I've linked below: [Jonathan Isaac: A Unicorn on the Defensive End](http://dailydribbledrive.blogspot.com/2019/12/jonathan-isaac-unicorn-on-defensive-end.html)]*

**Jonathan Isaac broke out as an [early Defensive Player of the Year-candidate](https://www.nba.com/magic/magics-minister-defense-vying-all-defense-accolades-20191207) for the Orlando Magic this season** - only an unfortunate season-ending left knee injury 32 games in stopped him from achieving a well-deserved All-Defensive spot this year. 

While Isaac's gaudy per-game averages (**7 rebounds, 1.6 steals, [2.4 blocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZXVeTZhjcs)**) are useful shorthand, they actually underplays his overall impact because of how truly unicorn-ish and all-encompassing his defensive profile is.

- **Paint defense**

It all starts with Judah's elite rim protection - opponents shoot a sizeable [10.2 FG% worse within 6 feet of the rim](https://stats.nba.com/player/1628371/defense-dash/) ([50.9 DFG%](https://stats.nba.com/players/defense-dash-lt6/?CF=GP*GE*30&sort=LT_06_PCT&dir=-1)) when Isaac is the closest defender, where his savant-like shot-blocking instincts kick in as the Magic's defensive anchor. Whether he's the primary defender or the weak-side help, he's got fantastic footwork and is very quick off his feet, possessing a mean second-jump. Combined with his 6-11 frame, 7-1 wingspan, and an excellent sense of timing, Isaac is an athletic, long, and relentless roadblock at the rim to thwart otherwise high-percentage opponent shot-attempts in the paint. He's able to tussle with larger behemoths as well - [here he is denying Embiid at the rim with one hand](https://streamable.com/qa8pv). In addition, Isaac remains quite disciplined, managing to consistently remain vertical on his contests and averaging only 2.5 fouls/game, impressive for a 3rd-year defender just 22 years of age.

- **Man defense**

Isaac's man defense is already highly impressive, able to guard bigs and guards alike without giving an inch (he has a [62.2% versatility index](https://i.imgur.com/fME2yWq.png)) and able to guard [either the primary or secondary offensive options effectively](https://i.imgur.com/Q088NW4.png) while also protecting the rim. He's got quick hands that he uses to force turnovers, constantly stripping players when they [gather](https://streamable.com/dttop) or [pick up their dribble](https://streamable.com/rwayu). In the [post](https://streamable.com/c34j8), his length and lanky frame makes him a pest. When defending perimeter threats, his [footwork](https://streamable.com/ogryr) is [impeccable](https://streamable.com/iupb0), he [maneuvers screens](https://streamable.com/4iprp) really [well](https://streamable.com/ww1qq),  and he's agile and long enough to shut down the [Greek Freak in semi-transition](https://streamable.com/0gmda). When he *is* beat, he often chases perpetrators down [from behind](https://streamable.com/25xzi).

- **Team defense**

Isaac's off-ball activity and team defense, meanwhile, is reminiscent of peak Draymond, KG, or Andrei Kirilenko, constantly making [timely rotations](https://streamable.com/wlfby) to eat up [passing lanes](https://streamable.com/cconj), [anticipating and disrupting opponent plays](https://streamable.com/vk9im), crowding ball-handlers and [halting dribble-penetration](https://streamable.com/ny8ck), closing out to shooters, and [swatting shot attempts at the rim](https://streamable.com/teb3u), basically making himself an all-around menace on the court.

- **Some of his few defensive weaknesses**: 

He can gamble at times for steals (which does work out more often than not thanks to his length and instincts) and occasionally [foul on shot contests](https://streamable.com/jurqn), he can get [caught out-of-position](https://streamable.com/hc0up) in the post sometimes, and he can be a bit overly twitchy in the paint, falling for [pump-fakes](https://streamable.com/f3ztv) from time to time. 


- **Orlando's best and most important defender**:

He leads the team and ranks near the top of the league in [steals/game](https://stats.nba.com/players/traditional/?sort=STL&dir=-1) (1.6), [blocks/game](https://stats.nba.com/players/traditional/?sort=BLK&dir=-1) (2.4), [defensive loose-balls recovered](https://stats.nba.com/players/hustle/?sort=DEF_LOOSE_BALLS_RECOVERED&dir=1&Season=2019-20&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) (0.8), and [deflections/game](https://stats.nba.com/players/hustle/?sort=DEFLECTIONS&dir=1&Season=2019-20&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) (3.3); is 2nd on the team in [charges drawn](https://stats.nba.com/players/hustle/?sort=CHARGES_DRAWN&dir=1&Season=2019-20&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) (0.13), [defensive box-outs](https://stats.nba.com/players/box-outs/?sort=DEF_BOXOUTS&dir=1) (2.0); and is 3rd in [defensive rebounds/game](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/ORL/2020.html) (5.2). 

**With Isaac on the court, the Orlando Magic's defensive rating jumps by a whopping [4.5 points](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/i/isaacjo01/on-off/2020) to an excellent 106.5 DRTG (-3.9 rDRTG), which would rank as the [4th-best defense in the league](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020.html#all_misc_stats) over a full season**, significantly higher than the 9th place (109.0 DRTG) the Magic ended up at at the time of the NBA's suspension.

Box- and non-box advanced metrics all think very highly of Isaac's overall defensive impact - he has a +4.8 [D-RAPTOR](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-nba-player-ratings/) (3rd in NBA), +3.2 [D-PIPM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l6PWeds4w99_z1aQ5sxrwwjyTST_-esvRbQxAQHbsyE/edit#gid=0) (4th), and a [+2.9]( https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/i/isaacjo01.html#advanced::none) [D-BPM](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020_advanced.html) (3rd). 

- **So what's next for Isaac?**

Isaac is slowly starting to get the benefit of the doubt from referees:

>*""I thought they were going to call it, I thought they were going to call it goaltending,’’ [said a relieved Isaac](https://www.nba.com/magic/magics-minister-defense-vying-all-defense-accolades-20191207) after his Magic notched their fourth straight victory – this one a gritty 93-87 defeat of Cleveland. ""I just tried to get (Thompson’s hook shot) at its highest point, and they gave it to me. I think the refs are starting to let me slide a little bit and I like it.’’*

It probably won't be very long before Isaac will be able to run rampant as a full-blown terror on the defensive end, and combined with his decent ancillary offensive numbers as a tertiary scorer / potential floor-spacer (12.0 PPG, 2.8 3PA, 33 3P%), Jonathan is already a truly indispensable part of the Magic rotation for the foreseeable future.

(*Bonus clip that perhaps summarises the entirety of Isaac's versatile skillset: His* [***near-5x5 performance***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ttNXKE9pLM) *in a 1-point loss vs the Dallas Mavericks' historic league-leading offense on November 6, putting up* ***13/10/5/6/4*** *while tormenting Porzingis all night long (10 pts, 2 TOVs, 29 FG%) and holding Luka and KP to a combined 37 points on 35 shots (47.5 TS%) and 8 turnovers.*)

#2: **Christian Wood, the NBA's newest unicorn**

---

After 49 games of being an overqualified backup to Andre Drummond (averaging 10/5/1/1/1 on excellent efficiency), Detroit finally moved Christian Wood into the starting lineup after Drummond got traded to Cleveland for their final 13 games before the NBA suspended its season. 

- **""Sooo.. who is Wood, and why should we care?""**

**In his final 13 games, Christian Wood has played like a bonafide star, averaging** ***22.8 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 2.0 assists, 0.8 blocks, 0.8 steals, and 1.7 threes*** **on 66% True Shooting (56 FG%, 40 3P% on 4.2 3PA, 76 FT%).**

He's been remarkably consistent as well, scoring fewer than 17 points only once during this stretch, and showing up against a variety of good teams - 3 of his final 4 games were against stout opposition, and he rose to the challenge admirably, with outputs of 29/9/3 on 91 TS% vs OKC, 30/11/2 on 56 TS% vs the Jazz and reigning DPOY Gobert, and a career-high 32/7/2/3/2 on 81 TS% v.s. Philly.

- **""He's on a bad team though, and Detroit lost all but one of those 13 games. Aren't these just empty numbers?""**

There's exists some evidence that these aren't empty calorie numbers.

For one thing, Wood is an advanced stats darling - he ranks in the top-20 to 30 range in most box- and non-box metrics: +4.5 RAPTOR (18th), +3.1 BPM (BBRef) (27th), 0.184 WS/48 (24th), +2.98 PIPM (26th), +2.82 RPM (ESPN) (22nd), +2.09 RAPM (20th).

For another, the Pistons are a whopping [+10.9 points better](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/woodch01/on-off/2020) with Wood on the court, with their defensive rating improving by +3 and their offensive rating getting a ridiculous +8 boost.

- **""So, what makes him so effective?""** 

Offensively, Wood is particularly special, able to shine as either a PF or a C. 

When he plays the 5, he is an **elite roll-man** in the PnR ([97th percentile](https://stats.nba.com/players/roll-man/)); his potent roll-gravity often distracts defending bigs to get teammates easier looks at the rim. His athleticism and feathery touch allow him to finish at an elite rate at the rim ([77 FG% in restricted area](https://stats.nba.com/player/1626174/shooting/)), either skying for lobs or shedding defenders with power and speed. 

Wood is very aggressive in the **short roll** too, bullying defenders with unflashy but effective bumps, pivots, fakes, and his leaping ability, not shying away from contact either, affording him a healthy free-throw rate overall (6 FTA/game as starter, 76 FT%). 

Wood is also a highly capable **offensive rebounder** (3.2 ORB/game in final 13 games, top 20 in ORB%), adept at following up on both teammate misses and his own. 

Of course, Wood is also a **remarkable shooter** for his position (**40 3P% on 4.2 3pa/game** in final 13 games), with a quick and high release off-the-catch that's unbothered by all but the longest of perimeter defenders, opening up driving lanes for teammates with his gravity. [""Wood is the rare stretch-4 who doubles as a rim-running 5""](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/3/10/21172174/christian-wood-detroit-pistons-free-agency), allowing coaches a high level of versatility when designing offensive sets. Wood possesses a smooth dribble, too, which lets him attack closeouts and slash to the basket. 


- **""What about on defense, though?""**

Defensively speaking, Wood has tremendous physical tools: 7-3 wingspan, excellent feet, highly athletic, making him a [highly versatile defender](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/UnequaledCluelessBluegill-mobile.mp4) capable of guarding speedy guards on switches ([68.9 versatility index](https://i.imgur.com/iMvL8uv.png)). He's a [decent rim-protector](https://stats.nba.com/players/defense-dash-lt6/?sort=LT_06_PCT&dir=-1&CF=GP*GE*49&Season=2019-20&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) - opponents shoot [6% worse](https://stats.nba.com/player/1626174/defense-dash/) within 6 feet of the hoop when Wood is the closest defender, and Detroit as a whole are +4.4 points better defensively when Wood is on the court. His pick-and-roll defense is actually quite decent, knowing when to drop and timing his contests well. Overall, he's likely a slight positive on defense.

- **""Does he suck at anything?""**

Wood can't power through larger defenders, and his post game is highly limited. To quote Jonathan Tjarks, ""his **ability to score one-on-one is still mostly theoretical**—he’s in the 22nd percentile of post scorers this season and the 10th percentile in isolations."" 

Wood is also a **subpar playmaker** - he had a 2.0/2.3 assist-to-turnover ratio in his final 13 games. He can make basic reads out of double-teams, but has yet to truly weaponise his own scoring threat to get teammates easier looks on a more consistent basis. 

**Defensively**, his awareness as a team defender has room for improvement, and his motor can be sloppy (seen in some mediocre box-outs or close-outs). He also has trouble against heftier post players, and some speedy guards can blow by him.

Finally, **Small Sample Size alert**! Some regression is very likely expected for Wood's gaudy shooting numbers once more teams learn more about his abilities and begin to throw more defenders (and better defenders) on him.

- **""So what's the future like for Christian?""**

>*Wood is trusting his teammates more on both sides of the ball. He’s not forcing things on offense... Wood is scoring by giving the ball up and trusting it will come back to him when he’s open instead of constantly hunting for his own shot.*

Wood doesn't demand touches and is highly efficient in his role, something that will let him **scale well on good offenses**, something that bodes well for his future as a Piston but also makes him an attractive addition for a playoff side - he's an unrestricted free-agent this summer. If he carries or builds upon this level of production into next season, he'll easily be a Most Improved Player contender with All-Star potential.

- **""Hmm, I'm actually kinda interested in knowing more about him!""**

In that case, here are two marvellous breakdowns of Wood's game which I consumed and referenced voraciously while writing this section:

#3: **Jaren Jackson Jr, one of the best volume-shooters in the league**

---

Jaren Jackson Jr ([17/5/1.5 on +2.6 rTS%](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jacksja02.html)), is a [proper **unicorn**](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/1/15/21065775/jaren-jackson-jr-highlights-memphis-grizzlies-stats-video-unicorn), and easily the 2nd most important offensive piece on the Grizzlies, mainly due to his [elite floor-spacing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4fbvX00l6o&t=2m54s) opening things up considerably for their offense - he's frighteningly adept at his role, hitting 40% of his 6 to 7 three-point attempts per game. 


- **""Surely the section title is clickbait or hyperbole, though, right? He's just a big, after all, he can't be that good""**

Actually, **[there are only 11 other players in the entire league](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&match=single&type=totals&per_minute_base=36&per_poss_base=100&season_start=1&season_end=-1&lg_id=NBA&age_min=0&age_max=99&is_playoffs=N&height_min=0&height_max=99&year_min=2020&year_max=2020&birth_country_is=Y&as_comp=gt&as_val=0&pos_is_g=Y&pos_is_gf=Y&pos_is_f=Y&pos_is_fg=Y&pos_is_fc=Y&pos_is_c=Y&pos_is_cf=Y&c1stat=g&c1comp=gt&c1val=30&c2stat=fg3a_per_g&c2comp=gt&c2val=6.2&c3stat=fg3_pct&c3comp=gt&c3val=39.7&order_by=ws)** (≥30 GP) who have shot at least as accurately as Jaren (39.7 3P%) on at least as many attempts (6.3 3PA).

Here are [all 135 3-pointers ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Ko5qvt_v8) he's made this season, just to get an idea of how he shoots these, and here's him [draining 9 threes  ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQAxF9sn8zM) on the league-leading Bucks' defense en route to a career-high 43 points.

- **""So does he just stand in the corner and wait for Ja to feed him?""**

Not exactly... **JJJ has a somewhat atypical form but a quick and high release, and he shoots [a truly incredible variety of threes](https://i.imgur.com/m0bJGaZ.png), making them as part of [pick-and-pop](https://i.imgur.com/OTTaEWo.mp4) action, some simply [off-the-dribble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQAxF9sn8zM&t=1m17s), some [stepbacks](https://i.imgur.com/4toJAbS.mp4), some in [transition](https://i.imgur.com/7VNIXKj.mp4), some [on the move](https://i.imgur.com/Lhtik2L.mp4), some [off screens](https://i.imgur.com/no4QLFW.mp4), or and he even sprinkles in the odd [logo yeet](https://i.imgur.com/wrydAIx.mp4) from 30 feet out.**

To quote some more from this [excellent SB Nation breakdown of Jaren Jackson Jr's versatile game by Mike Prada](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/1/15/21065775/jaren-jackson-jr-highlights-memphis-grizzlies-stats-video-unicorn):

>The fact that Jackson can take and make so many different kinds of threes enables the Grizzlies to deploy him in so many different spots on the court. He has no obvious sweet spot, which means there’s rarely a worry he’ll catch the ball somewhere he doesn’t belong. He can toggle between playmaker, primary scorer, screener, and floor spacer, depending on what the Grizzlies need at that particular moment.

>Better yet, he can do all four within the same play, which ensures Memphis’ sets always have secondary options. A pick-and-pop that the defense covers effectively can quickly swing into a dribble handoff, post-up, or second-side screening action, and it’s difficult for the defense to peg exactly where Jackson fits in to those sequences. In an instant, he’s flipped from the big man screener that gets a guard open into the primary option on a flare screen to get him a three.

>[[vid]](https://i.imgur.com/2Brl8qQ.gifv)

>And if that shot isn’t there, he can quickly flow back into being a screener for a guard curling up from the corner.

>[[vid]](https://i.imgur.com/PVDxbhA.gifv)

>Or — and this is spicy — he can invert the traditional big/guard setup and act as the ball-handler immediately.

>[[vid]](https://i.imgur.com/PVDxbhA.gifv)

- **""[I realise this section is about his shooting, but just quickly, what else can he do?](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/1/15/21065775/jaren-jackson-jr-highlights-memphis-grizzlies-stats-video-unicorn)""**

Well, overplaying JJJ's shooting is unwise  - he possesses a decent handle for a big (relatively few turnovers considering he drives quite often) and is excellent at attacking closeouts and finishing at in the paint (65 FG% in restricted area). Some of his long strides and wrong-footed finishes bring to mind [Pascal Siakam](https://i.imgur.com/mTXEWTO.gifv). His [post scoring](https://stats.nba.com/players/playtype-post-up/?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*jaren) is well below-average (26th percentile), his ISO scoring is decent (65th percentile), and his shooting in the non-restricted area of the paint (floaters and such) isn't anything to write home about (39.5 FG%). Interestingly, he rarely takes midrange shots, attempting a James Harden-esque *16* midrange attempts over the entire season.

Defensively-speaking, Jaren is very versatile and has incredible length, athleticism, footwork, and timing, able to switch onto bigs and guards alike with equal ease and possessing preternatural defensive instincts as a help defender. However, he is still some way from fulfilling his [All-Defensive, even DPOY potential](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLZedhbG5bI), as he's haunted by persistent fouling issues  - he's averaged 5.2 fouls/36 in each of his first 2 seasons. His rebounding rate is anemic for a player his size, too (3.7 D-Rebs/game) - part of this might be due to him playing out on the perimeter a lot, part of it might just be due to his rebounding being naturally poor. (In case you were wondering, JJJ's lack of rebounding isn't a Steven Adams issue because he's just boxing people out all the time, either - he's [109th](https://stats.nba.com/players/box-outs/?sort=DEF_BOXOUTS&dir=1) in the league in defensive-box-outs/game.) His current overall defensive impact, therefore, is quite neutral at the moment - most advanced numbers don't think highly of it. Memphis have the 16th ranked defense in the league, and their defensive rating actually *improves* with JJJ *off* the court (some of this might just be noise, or perhaps a case of Grizzlies' backups shining against weaker bench units). In any case, these current defensive shortcomings are something Grizzlies fans will likely gladly live with, considering JJJ's offensive value and the promise of future improvements in his defensive impact once he learns to foul less.

#4: **Kris Dunn**, the modern-era Tony Allen?

---

**This season, the Bulls' dogged guard slash forward Kris Dunn has graded out consistently as [one of the very best and most impactful defenders in the NBA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMznAMjpV0E), regardless of position.** For the first time in his career, Dunn's team is A) excellent at defense with him on the court, and B) much better on defense *with* him on the court than without.

First, though, let's get the numbers out of the way: 

- Height: 6-3, Weight: 205 lb, **Wingspan: 6-10**, 51 GP, 24.9 MPG 

- **2nd in Steals/game (2.0)**, **1st in Steal %** [by a wide margin](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020_advanced.html), **4th in Deflections/game** (only player in the top 11 averaging fewer than 25 minutes a night), **8th in Defensive loose-balls recovered/game**

- 2nd in Defensive Box Plus Minus (BBRef) 

- 5th in Defensive PIPM 

- 7th Defensive RAPTOR, which incorporates player tracking data

- 7th in Defensive RAPM / Luck-adjusted RAPM 

- 13th in Defensive Real Plus-Minus (ESPN) 

- Bulls have a **106.4 Defensive Rating (-4.0 rDRTG) with Kris Dunn** on the floor, which would rank **4th** in the NBA over a full season. The Bulls defense also improves by a massive **+6.2 points** when Dunn enters the game.

- **67.8 [Versatility Index](https://i.imgur.com/gvi6Fyk.png)**, guarding positions 1-3 at least 19% of the time each, and spending 15% of his possessions guarding PFs and Cs

- [**Held pick-and-roll ball-handlers to 0.71 points per possession**](https://stats.nba.com/players/ball-handler/#!?SeasonType=Regular%20Season&TypeGrouping=defensive&sort=PPP&dir=-1&CF=POSS*GE*3), one of the best marks in the league

- Can guard [either the primary or secondary offensive options highly effectively](https://i.imgur.com/BohIXUU.png) as required

- Opponents shoot [1.5% worse on 3s when Dunn is the closest defender](https://stats.nba.com/player/1627739/defense-dash/)

- *""Among those who logged at least 20 minutes per game, Dunn led all players in the percentage of his [points that came off a turnover](https://tinyurl.com/ybxact9p), at a whopping* ***29.3 percent.*** *It’s reminiscent of prime  Tony Allen — who used to live near the top of the league in this category — and more than doubled his production from the previous year.""*

Adding on some more quotes from [**Michael Pina's fantastic SB Nation breakdown of Dunn's defense**, *""Kris Dunn is a dying breed in today’s NBA. That’s why he’s so fascinating""*](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/2/27/21156173/kris-dunn-chicago-bulls-free-agency-contract-qualifying-offer):

>On the night Kris Dunn suffered a knee injury that will likely end his season, I sat by his locker to chat about defense. Considering no guard in the NBA has been better at it this season, the topic made sense.

>We talked about... The dark arts that go into learning his opponent’s specific tendencies:

>*“A lot of guys who are righties like to go left to be able to get to their jump shot, and a lot of people who are righties like to go downhill to their right side. But if you’re a righty, most likely you like to go left. I just feel like you just have, you know, more in your bag of tricks going left. If you’re a lefty, most of the time they like going right. It’s just how they do it.*

>*I like to break down to see what’s their go-to move. Some people when they come down the court, if they have the ball in their left hand, they’re getting ready to shoot. If they have the ball in their right hand, they’re ready to drive.”*

>... And player comparisons:

>*“I feel like Tony Allen, he just fits what I do. He’ll pounce on you. He was strong, physical. I think he could guard 1 through 3, even fours. I feel like I can guard some fours sometimes. I feel like that’s a good comparison because he’s got that dog, he’s got that bloodhound in him.”*

>**Dunn’s season-long defensive impact was, to be frank, spectacular. He thrived in Jim Boylen’s tight-rope-walk of a defensive scheme, torpedoing passing lanes, living in his man’s jersey, and never giving up on a possession.**

>For most defenders, including Dunn, a majority of his defensive possessions are spent off the ball, and it’s here where his knowledge, instincts, and timing swirl up into a typhoon that the offense then has to navigate.

>“He’s an all-defensive defender if I’ve ever seen one, and I’ve seen a few of them,” Boylen said right before the injury. “Paul George, Kawhi Leonard. He’s an All-Defensive guy.”


- **Indeed, Kris Dunn should receive some serious consideration for an All-Defensive spot.** He may not get it because the Bulls are bad and his offensive role is limited, hence he likely won't be well-known to most voters, but he's clearly been one of the best guard defenders in the league this year, and one of the most impactful defenders in the league, period.

#5: **Kawhi Leonard, [playmaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOicOPrxnHw&t=38s)**

---

This entry might surprise some readers, but yes, in the 2019-20 season, reigning Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard has finally broken out as a PASSER - **5.0 APG, decent 1.9:1 AST/TO ratio, 27.0 AST%, impressive 6.7 Passer Rating (Backpicks).**

**See, [prior to this season, Kawhi was not actually a very good passer or playmaker.](https://streamable.com/ey30qe)** 

- **A fun and relevant stat- Kawhi only has 10 TOTAL career games   (regular season and playoffs combined) with 8 or more assists, and a whopping 7 of them came in the 2019-20 regular season. ([source](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&match=game&year_min=2012&year_max=2020&is_playoffs=E&age_min=0&age_max=99&season_start=1&season_end=-1&pos_is_g=Y&pos_is_gf=Y&pos_is_f=Y&pos_is_fg=Y&pos_is_fc=Y&pos_is_c=Y&pos_is_cf=Y&player_id=leonaka01&c1stat=ast&c1comp=gt&c1val=7&order_by=date_game))**

**[In previous years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93zief7g2Jk&t=11m5s)**, Kawhi has had a few high-assist games in the playoffs, mostly as a result of making basic passes out of double-teams when teams commit multiple defenders to slow down his monster playoff-scoring, but he's never been a proficient playmaking wing like LeBron/Kobe/MJ, often lacking accuracy and velocity on many of his passes, and very rarely making more advanced reads (throwing skip passes out of a Pick-and-Roll/PnR, for example). After developing into the amazing ISO scorer we now know him as in 2017, Kawhi was generally in score-first mode for the vast majority of his possessions, generally only trying to find teammates when his own attack had fizzled out. This slightly limited his team's and his own ceiling as an offensive force, unable to punish help consistently and effectively. 

**[This season, though, Kawhi burst out of the gate as a shockingly comfortable and effective passer and playmaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOicOPrxnHw&t=38s)**, averaging 8 APG in his first 4 games. Far from his probing, soft, and hesitant passes late in the shot clock to teammates in previous years, this version of the Klaw tries to keep his head up and his offensive options open, always tracking where his teammates are. He consistently hits the Clippers' bigs Zubac and Harrell in the PnR with crisp high-speed bounce-passes, throws no-looks and skip passes to shooters, and even manipulates defenders by freezing them with his eyes before rapidly lasering the ball to open teammates under the rim. 

**To quote [Zach Lowe](https://www.espn.com.au/nba/story/_/id/27969493/ten-nba-things-like-including-karl-anthony-towns-superstar-push)**:

>*He already has developed chemistry with two very different dance partners in Ivica Zubac and Montrezl Harrell. Zubac is more laborious, and so Leonard navigates with zigzaggy, start-and-stop patience until Zubac rumbles free: [clip](https://media.video-cdn.espn.com/gifs/mp4/GSW_LAC_KAWHI_2GIF.mp4)*

>*Harrell can zip to the rim or mirror Leonard's pitter-pat. Harrell also is a master at re-screening at different angles, and Leonard is learning to bob and weave behind him -- and use the threat of a handoff to slice backdoor: [clip](https://media.video-cdn.espn.com/gifs/mp4/LAC_LAL_KAWHI_2GIF.mp4)*



**His passing leap shows up on [film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJms7V7To3U)**, too, where he [rarely looks lost anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47Br35fT8cU), knowing where his teammates are at all times, but it also shows up in the numbers: **easily a career-high 5.0 assists/game** (previous high was 3.3 in 2017), **27.0 AST%** (previous high 18.9% in 2017). 

The rest of the league should be worried - one of the finest scorers in the game has finally upgraded his passing game to match.

Pascal Siakam was voted as a starter to his first all-star team this season and has been the number one option on a Raptors team that finished 2019-20 with the leagues second best record. Toronto have proven everyone wrong this year and are continuing to silence the doubters, but as they look set to face Boston in the second round and potentially Miami or Milwaukee should they advance, I feel that their lack of consistent offence could limit the squads chance of success. They are a very deep team who don't rely on Siakam individually but do you think his weaknesses against good teams are a cause for concern and something that will hold the Raptors back?",nbadiscussion
1069,74,Derrick Rose is the youngest MVP in NBA history. Who came closest to winning MVP at a younger age?,"Most of you probably know D-Rose was the youngest MVP in NBA history. But how close has anyone come to winning MVP at an even younger age? Here is every player to finish top 5 in MVP voting at a younger age than Rose was his MVP season. Note: I calculated their age as of January 1st of that season.

|Player|Season|Age in days|MVP Finish|
:--|:--|--:|:--|
|Derrick Rose|2010-11|8,124|1st|
|Kevin Durant|2009-10|7,764|2nd|
|LeBron James|2005-06|7,678|2nd|
|Shaquille O'Neal|1993-94|7,971|4th|
|Oscar Robertson|1960-61|8,074|5th|
|Dwight Howard|2007-08|8,059|5th|
|LeBron James|2006-07|8,043|5th|
|Anthony Davis|2014-15|7,966|5th|
|Tim Duncan|1997-98|7,921|5th|
|Luka Doncic|2019-20|7,612|?|

I included Luka because I think he'll finish top 5 this season, and if he were to win MVP next season, he'd then be the youngest MVP in history. 

Probably not a huge surprise that KD and LeBron came the closest. KD lost to LeBron in MVP voting by a landslide in 2009-10, so to me the answer here is LeBron in 2005-06. LeBron averaged 31/7/7 that season and the Cavs won 50 games with Ilgauskas being their 2nd best player. Ultimately LeBron lost to Nash in MVP voting, but he's got the best case for a player younger than Rose to have won MVP.",nbadiscussion
1070,75,"Paul George was supposed to be what Kawhi Leonard is today, the two-way “LeBron stopper” superstar.","After watching Dom2K’s video talking about how PG and Westbrook on them becoming one of the more forgettable duos in this modern day era it has made me think about Paul George. Don’t get me wrong he’s a star. Last year, he looked like a top 3 two-way player behind Giannis and Kawhi; and he was a MVP caliber player last year finishing third. But he’s career has been fairly strange. Like I said he’s great we’ve known that ever since we saw him and the Pacers put up a great fight against the Heatles. And he had superstar potential. From those playoff series against the Heat we thought we saw the next two-way superstar that would dethrone King James. But obviously, that brutal injury during Team USA practice had held him back. And then a new two-way star did what Paul George could’ve done, Kawhi Leonard. When Kawhi clamped up LeBron during the 2014 finals, we finally somebody who well stopped LeBron, a two-way star who could beat out LeBron, and winning Finals MVP in the process. And Kawhi would still develop. He brought Toronto a ring, bringing the most success the franchise had since well ever. And in the background, Paul George was still great but the injuries have derailed his career. Again still great but never THE superstar. It’s crazy to think what Paul George’s career could’ve looked liked at this point, the two-way superstar of today’s league; but well Kawhi’s got the job. But now these two two-way juggernauts are on the same team and are looking to win a championship. For Kawhi, a championship this year would solidify him to be a winning talent. And for Paul George, long destined playoff success.",nbadiscussion

1072,77,24 conclusions at the NBA trade deadline," 

Here we take a look at ***24*** questions/ideas that have been fulfilled in the 2019-20 season.

### #PlayForKobe

&#x200B;

**1. Jimmy Butler has found a home in Miami**

Pat Riley and Erik Spoelstra have practically settled in as a middle-of-the-pack team since moving on from the LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh trio.

There is a new star in town and that would be Jimmy Butler. Riley signed players like James Johnson, Dion Waiters, and Hassan Whiteside (no longer with the team) to questionable contracts. However, the new young talent he added in guys like Tyler Herro, Kendrick Nunn, and All-Star Bam Adebayo has given the Heat new standing in the East.

Also recall that Chris Paul was rumored to be a main target of this team over the summer. That talk appears to have all but vanished. South Beach is heating up again with Butler averaging career-highs of 9.4 FTA, 6.8 REB, 6.3 AST.

&#x200B;

**2. Derrick Rose Hall of Fame talk is also heating up**

D-Rose just recently ended his streak of 14 consecutive games with 20 or more points. That’s the first time that’s happened since his 2010-11 MVP campaign. It would surely be rare to see a regular season MVP winner actually miss the Hall of Fame but that’s where Rose appeared to be heading until the last year or so.

Despite scoring 50 points in a game while reuniting with Coach Tom Thibodeau in Minnesota last season, Rose missed over 30 games and the Timberwolves went down with him. Rose has played in 44 of 53 games this year, however, and has simply been terrific. That’s raised the question, “does Rose now deserve a spot in the Hall of Fame?”

Rose is shooting just shy of 50 percent from the field as well as averaging 25.2 points per 36 minutes. Both of those are career-best marks.

&#x200B;

**3. The Nuggets are no fluke**

Denver battled with Golden State for first place in the West nearly the entire 2018-19 season and eventually came up three games short. As of today, the Lakers are the only Western Conference team with more wins. It’s a lot more than just winning numbers though. 

Nikola Jokic’s sensational offensive regime (20.6 PTS, 10.3 REB, 6.8 AST) gives them every reason they need to challenge (or actually be) the best of the West. The Nuggets are one of seven teams with a top-12 offensive efficiency and defensive efficiency and their defense has actually been slightly better than their offense.

This remains the team that overwhelms almost every other team with too much depth. The Nuggets would probably have to sacrifice some of that depth in order to get another star-caliber player alongside Jokic and Jamal Murray. The notion around the league seems to indicate that’s in their best interest.

&#x200B;

**4. OKC is way better off after trading Westbrook/George**

Let’s quickly recap the Thunder’s offseason: traded Paul George to the Clippers for Danilo Gallinari, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and five future first-round picks (plus the right to swap picks), traded Russell Westbrook to the Rockets for Chris Paul and two future first-round picks (plus the right to swap two different picks), traded Jerami Grant to the Nuggets for a first-round pick, and drafted Darius Bazley.

OKC clearly intended to reset and proceed into rebuilding mode despite acquiring a win-now player in CP3. The difference after 50 games from last year: that’s right, only two games worse than the team led by Westbrook and George. 21-year-old Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (26.6 PTS per 100 possessions) is no pushover but a rising star.

&#x200B;

**5. Trae Young is the real deal**

I’m not sure it’s completely fair to proclaim him the second coming of Stephen Curry and here’s why: so many guards these days have a shoot-first mentality because they can really shoot the ball. Young is one of many but definitely does give us flashes of a young Curry the way he lets loose from the halfcourt logo.

Young is averaging almost 30 points in his sophomore season and Curry didn’t even average over 20 points until his fourth year in the league. It’s scary that Young still has so much room to improve, and in reality, has no ceiling whatsoever. You may not know he shoots better than 50 percent from inside the arc too.

Unfortunately the Hawks are one of the three most lowly-performing teams this season but Young figures to change that in due time. Atlanta pulled the trigger on trading for Clint Capela to bolster its frontcourt and that should go a long way in assisting Young in his quest for greatness.

&#x200B;

**6. The Clippers know how sought-after Montrezl Harrell will be**

Montrezl Harrell (career 31.3 PTS, 11.6 REB per 100 possessions) is set to become an unrestricted free agent after this year. With or without him though, the Clippers do and will continue to have championship aspirations.

Here’s where they may run into a problem: L.A.C. has over $98 million tied into Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Patrick Beverley, Lou Williams and Ivica Zubac for next season. Harrell’s market is really going to be buzzing and the Clippers may be financially unable to meet his requests.

Here’s another thing about Harrell: he has missed just one game over the past two seasons and that makes him perhaps even more valuable based on the contract he is about to earn this offseason. That’s the type of competitor any team would welcome with open arms.

&#x200B;

**7. Malcolm Brogdon is a really good player the Bucks don’t need**

This is anything but a knock on Malcolm Brogdon because he might be one of the most fundamentally sound players in the league. The Bucks just had enough firepower to withstand his loss without giving an inch to opposing contenders.

Therefore, this is more about how the Bucks contentedly built their team over the years rather than the individual destiny of Brogdon. He isn’t en enemy of Milwaukee either because this was the team responsible for giving him the freedom to transform from second-round pick to Rookie of the Year.

Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton and Eric Bledsoe give them everything that Brogdon gave them and more. Brogdon is now with the Pacers and could potentially match up with the Bucks should they escape the first round. That would be a fun matchup but a healthy Bucks team should easily win.

&#x200B;

**8. Pascal Siakam is unarguably a franchise player**

Their Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard moved across the U.S. but the Raptors have somehow found a way to remain elite – at least in the company of Eastern Conference teams not named the Bucks.

Here’s a little clue: it’s mainly because of Pascal Siakam (2.1 3PM, 23.7 PTS, 7.7 REB), one of the top two-way players in the league and now a constant threat in the East. The Raptors are currently riding a franchise-best 12-game winning streak and they’ve even fared reasonably well through injuries (Siakam included).

Siakam was seen as more of an unsung hero at this time last year, like not quite an All-Star but more than serviceable as a second or third option and a certified pest defensively. Siakam has come a long way in a short period of time. Maybe the restaurants in Toronto should offer him free food since Leonard didn’t accept it.

&#x200B;

**9. The Spurs are (finally) an average team at best**

The Spurs traded for DeMar DeRozan (53.7 FG%, 23.2 PTS, 5.2 AST) two summers ago with the intent of maintaining playoff legitimacy in the Western Conference. That hasn’t worked out so well though as it appears time is finally not their friend but their enemy.

LaMarcus Aldridge’s best days are behind him, and while he can still erupt for 30 points any given night, younger big men like Bam Adebayo, John Collins and Domantas Sabonis have surpassed him in convincing fashion. Soon enough there will be more players joining that list.

Dejounte Murray recently put the pen to paper on a four-year, $64-million extension but has yet to capitalize on the player we anticipated him to be. Murray might be fully recovered from his torn ACL but he’s clearly still adapting to the situation while playing just 24 minutes per game.

&#x200B;

**10. Brandon Ingram is finally showing his KD-like tendencies**

Being drafted by the Lakers gave Brandon Ingram all the attention he needed as soon as he entered the league in the 2016-17 season. By the standards there, however, Ingram was underwhelmingly nothing more than a solid player and turned into more of a trade rumor topic when LeBron James signed there.

The trade to the Pelicans has given Ingram new life and he’s emerged on the scene and blossomed into an All-Star before our eyes. It might be a reach to compare anyone to Kevin Durant but an early-career Ingram isn’t a terrible comparison.

Ingram is one of 13 players averaging 25 points per game and is now very reliable beyond the perimeter where he shoots exactly 40 percent.

&#x200B;

**11. Andre Iguodala’s work is not finished**

The 2015 Finals MVP has collected three Larry O’Brien trophies in the last five years as a member of the Warriors, who felt obligated to trade him for salary reasons. Iguodala refused to report to the Grizzlies, the team that traded for him, and his wish was finally granted with him now heading to Miami.

At this point in his career, Iguodala wants one thing and that’s more championship rings. There were several suitors for the 36-year-old swingman who has done it all from winning championships to hitting game-winning shots to claiming All-Defensive honors and so forth.

Is there any team (especially contender) that couldn’t use Iguodala? He’s a guy there’s always room for regardless of how solidified a team’s rotation is more than halfway through the season. That’s why the Heat conceded a young asset in Justise Winslow for Iguodala’s services.

&#x200B;

**12. Big men continue to get the most credit on defense**

Since Michael Jordan won the award in the 1987-88 season, 13 of the 17 Defensive Player of the Year winners have been big men (when including power forwards Draymond Green and Dennis Rodman). That’s not unordinary with guys like today’s Rudy Gobert, the back-to-back DPOY, having the height, wingspan and motor to thoroughly affect the game on that side of the ball.

There certainly is a fair share of lockdown perimeter defenders but that seems to blend in as more of a team effort. Gobert and Draymond Green have something in common: that’s being able to protect the rim but also have the versatility to defend quicker players at times. Anthony Davis appears to have made his way into the conversation to dethrone Gobert and it’s very possible with how effective the Lakers’ defense has been this season.

&#x200B;

**13. The Celtics’ team chemistry has been restored**

It was apparent that last year’s team was lacking a locker room connections amongst all the players. Al Horford is not an easy guy to lose for that matter because his leadership has been well-documented throughout his career. However, questions surrounding Kyrie Irving’s leadership have also been well-documented.

The Celtics were hopeful Kemba Walker would not only take the keys to the offense but also be the vocal leader this team apparently needed. Does Irving get too much negative speculation over his leadership skills? Yes, he probably does but that isn’t to disregard what this team was missing last year.

Another year and another loaded roster filled with talent for the Celtics. Now they need something to show for it on the court when it comes playoff time.

&#x200B;

**14. The Blake Griffin trade isn’t looking great in hindsight**

This take wouldn’t have been accepted last season as Blake Griffin had the best all-around season of his career. The root of the problem was overworking Griffin last year to the point where he just wasn’t the same by the time the playoffs came around and that has yet to change with him likely being shut down for the remainder of this season.

That being said, I’m not one to be extra critical of the move by Pistons former management because the deal didn’t look half bad at the time. The Pistons were hungry for a franchise player and perhaps Griffin could have been that long-term if they had simply managed his workload better.

Sometimes it’s tough to judge anything outside of the present-day scenario and that would be the two years, $75 million remaining on his contract following this year. The Pistons are in need of a bold move that pays off.

&#x200B;

**15. Damian “Dame Time” Lillard is officially unstoppable**

Damian Lillard (career-highs 46.1 FG%, 29.7 PTS, 7.9 AST) has saluted the late legend with a string of 40-and-50-point performances reminiscent of the great Kobe Bryant. His scoring totals were as follows from January 20th through February 1st: 61, 47, 50, 36, 48 and 51.

Recall that Kobe scored 40 points or more in a period of nine straight games in the 2002-03 season. Then in 2007, he scored at least 50 points in four consecutive games. Lillard shot about 57 percent from three-point land on a whopping 49 made triples in his respective series of games.

The crazy thing about Lillard is that he’s a five-time All-Star but he’s never been named a starter. That’s not necessarily a shocker only because players on winning teams, such as Stephen Curry and James Harden, have gained more popularity in the media. Lillard has been the unscripted underdog for so long and it’s about time that’s changed.

&#x200B;

**16. Draymond Green is still a necessity for the Warriors’ success**

Draymond Green is well on his way to becoming one of the winningest players in NBA history. Since averaging 49 wins in his first two years in the league, the Warriors have won 57, 58, 67 (twice) and 73 games in each individual season. That’s until this season in which Green is finally on the other end of the totem pole.

I have a problem with calling this a lost season for he and the Warriors though. Sometimes you have to drop down in order to get back up. Therefore, the Warriors will be playing to win as long as Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson come back to full strength and both are young enough to be able to do so.

That leads me to this: in the midst of all these young rising stars, the Warriors need Green just as much as they ever have. It doesn’t matter how much more explosive or athletic an opponent is because he will continue to thrive and preach success off his towering I.Q. on both ends of the floor. 

&#x200B;

**17. The Wizards are really missing their All-Star point guard**

Although the roster makeup has changed quite a bit, it’s been over a year since five-time All-Star John Wall has been on the floor with his teammates. Wall really built his resume over the years and eventually developed into one of the league’s most dangerous athletes.

Since Wall has been out, it’s been backcourt mate Bradley Beal that’s picked up the slack. Wall’s absence has allowed Beal to expand his game in different areas, especially when it comes to playmaking. Whatever the case may be, Beal needs Wall back if this team is ever going to get back on track.

Wall and Beal’s contracts amount to over $140 million combined after this year and that’s not taking their third-year player options into account. The Wizards will have to make it work.

&#x200B;

**18. Pacers management has been stellar since dealing Paul George**

If you ask me, critics are wrong about half of the time and those critics couldn’t have been more incorrect when looking at the Paul Goerge deal in hindsight. At the time, Victor Oladipo was seen as a steady two-way player but that changed immediately after he was traded from OKC before the 2017-18 season.

Oladipo might not have all the ability that George did but he is just as committed (especially on defense). Oladipo has played only 40 games the past two seasons. The Pacers have stayed afloat during that time though because of the tough identity and work ethic he brought there.

Oladipo is a two-time All-Star and now Domantas Sabonis (54.0 FG%, 25.9 PTS, 17.9 REB per 100 possessions), the other piece they acquired in the George deal, was also just named an All-Star. In addition to that, if Malcolm Brogdon isn’t an All-Star then he has to be something close.

&#x200B;

**19. Luka Doncic’s rise to stardom didn’t take long**

It’s tough to call out the Suns for picking someone like Deandre Ayton because most other teams probably would have done the same. I think the entire league has already come to fruition with 20-year-old Luka Doncic, not just being a rare type of franchise player, but also a generational talent coming out of Europe.

Doncic is somewhere in between his predecessor Dirk Nowitzki and a young LeBron James. He’s making plays right now that James wouldn’t have even made in his sophomore season. Of course Doncic can’t attack the rim like James could but he possesses the same unselfish mentality and unprecedented playmaking skills.

Oh and another thing: the Mavs are making their Vegas over/under projection of 40.5 wins look foolish thanks to Doncic (28.8 PTS, 9.5 REB, 8.7 AST). He has taken Kristaps Porzingis under his wing and Porzingis doesn’t seem to mind being the complementary star.

&#x200B;

**20. There’s still room for Dwight Howard and Carmelo Anthony**

Until just recently, it’s been several years since both Dwight Howard and Carmelo Anthony were appreciated on their respective teams.

This is Howard’s second go-around with the Lakers, and while his stats aren’t nearly as good on paper, he has embraced a smaller role while accepting less responsibility on offense. He’s still expected to do what he’s always done on defense.

Anthony can be hard to gauge as it’s unclear how much he has left in the tank. This year, however, he has definitely taken a step forward while gaining the trust of Blazers coach Terry Stotts. Melo is shooting his best three-point percentage since 2013-14 and he’s still never averaged below 32 MPG outside of his short stint with Houston.

&#x200B;

**21. The Knicks are still trying to figure things out**

We hear nonstop about the Knicks repeatedly targeting marquee free agents and ultimately failing to bring them in. Marcus Morris wasn’t a bad consolation prize but he didn’t exactly make sense for a Knicks team with no apparent direction.

Like Kristaps Porzingis, Morris was also traded cross-conference to a team looking to make noise sooner rather than later. The Porzingis situation is still lingering on this franchise because there was initially so much hope surrounding him there.

There’s really only one way for the Knicks to get out of this mess and that’s hitting home-runs on all of their upcoming draft picks, which is a lot easier said than done.

&#x200B;

**22. There’s no more waiting, Devin Booker’s time is now**

First of all, I would like to piggyback off that header by saying Devin Booker is probably one of the more notable All-Star snubs in recent All-Star snub history. Look, there are a lot of great players and major depth at guard in the Western Conference. However, Booker can’t possibly be doing any more for his team right now.

Put an asterisk mark by his 2019-20 season statistics which show him shooting better than 50 percent from the field while averaging 26.7 points and 6.3 assists. On top of that, the Suns aren’t miserably bad like they had been his first four years.

Perhaps another 70-point performance would wake up everyone that’s sleeping on him because Phoenix might still have a ways to go before approaching the playoff conversation.

&#x200B;

**23. The Andrew Wiggins/Karl-Anthony Towns experiment didn’t go as planned**

The Wolves have lost 13 straight games and counting. Let’s just say the ball has not bounced their way as of late and the Andrew Wiggins trade rumors finally turned into a reality. Wiggins (30.3 PTS per 100 possessions) was getting a lot of praise earlier this season but that has quieted down since.

They took a chance on Jimmy Butler a couple of years ago and that never panned out either. They did, however, just trade for D’Angelo Russell who is a close friend of Karl-Anthony Towns. Russell now joins his fourth team in five seasons and we can only hope he flourishes as the veteran point guard Minnesota needed.

As for K.A.T., he remains one of the highest-upside players in the entire league. While he’ll be counting on Russell to give him the support he needs, the Timberwolves could still be looking at significant offseason changes.

&#x200B;

**24. The Rockets can’t be considered the contenders they were the last few years**

As great as it is seeing two former MVPs in James Harden and Russell Westbrook reunited, there are still some glaring doubts about whether the Rockets have enough to compete with the best of the West.

The Rockets rank in the top three of the league in offensive efficiency for the fourth straight season while Harden (nearly 36 PPG over last two years) is an offensive superhero that can’t be contained defensively. I don’t know if it’s fair to say this team will go as far as he takes them though.

Reason being is that he shouldn’t be at fault for making this team one-dimensional at times. General Manager Daryl Morey is always looking for ways to enrich the foundation he started building early last decade but he also tries to win with a different methodology, as we can see with Clint Capela recently being dealt.",nbadiscussion

1074,79,[OC] Ranking all 100 media members who vote on the NBA awards by how contrarian their ballots were (Most contrarian: Greg Logan of Newsday; Least contrarian: Kelly Iko of The Athletic),"Over the weekend, the [NBA released the individual ballots](https://pr.nba.com/voting-results-2019-20-nba-regular-season-awards/) of the 100 media members who voted on the awards. 

Last year, [I used the ballots for all 13 of the major awards to find who were the most and least controversial voters.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/c65eyx/oc_i_combed_through_every_nba_award_ballot_from/) That year I found Kennegh Lau to be the most contrarian voter while Doris Burke and Zach Lowe were the least contrarian. Unsurprisingly, Lau did not have a vote this season after he put Dwayne Wade on All-NBA Second Team and left Jokic and PG of his MVP ballot all together last season. 

This year I'm going to re-create my analysis from last season to rank every media member by how ""contrarian"" their ballots were. In short, I'm going to calculate the average distance between the points a voter award to players on a specific ballot and the average points those players received from voters. 

**** 

Here's an example of it works: 

* Andre Drummond received **one first place vote** for Defensive Player of the Year, which was worth 5 points. Since there are 100 media members, Drummond received on average 0.05 points per media member 

* Greg Logan of Newsday gave Drummond a first place vote for Defensive Player of the Year, again, which was worth 5 points. 

* 5 - 0.05 (average) = 4.95 point differential (absolute value taken, higher values are ""worse"")

* To penalize votes that were especially contrarian, I took the squared value of each difference. That means giving Andre Drummond five points for Defensive Player of the Year when his average points per media member was 0.05 would be a lot more ""contrarian"" than giving five points to Rudy Gobert, who finished third in the voting and had an average points per media member of 2.81.

* After I squared each result, I took the square root of the average difference between all the points awarded on a particular ballot and the average points the 100 media members awarded to those players on that ballot.  

* To continue to use Logan as an example, he gave Drummond 5 points (Drummond received 0.05 points per media member on average), Whiteside 3 points (0.03 points per media member) and Giannis 1 point (4.32 points per media member). 

**Drummond**: (5 - 0.05)^2 = 24.5

**Whiteside**: (3 - 0.03)^2 = 8.8

**Giannis**: (1 - 4.32)^2 = 11.0

**Average Deviation From The Consensus**: sqrt((24.5+8.8+11.0)/3)  = ~3.84

*  I did this same calculation for every media member for every award (MVP, Rookie of the Year, Sixth Man of the Year, Most Improved Player of the Year, Defensive Player of the Year, Coach of the Year, All-NBA First Team, All-NBA Second Team, All-NBA Third Team, All-Defensive First Team, All-Defensive Second Team, All-Rookie First Team, All-Rookie Second Team). 

* Lastly, I took the sum of all these average deviations from the 13 awards to create what I'm calling a ""Total Contrarian Score"" 

**If you don’t care about any of that, just know that the higher someone’s Total Contrarian Score, the more their ballots deviated from the average voter. The lower their score, the more closely their ballots resembled the consensus.** 

*** 

Before I get into the rankings I do want to note that **not all ballots that are considered contrarian by my calculations are ""bad"" or indefensible**. In fact, I like a lot of the ballots that ended up with high contrarian scores. 

For instance, Rod Beard's Most Improved ballot had the highest contrarian score for that award in part because he gave a first place vote to Christian Wood (0.11 average) and a second place vote to Devonte Graham (0.5 average). Both Wood and Graham had excellent breakout seasons and it's easy to make case for them to be on some voter's ballots. But because Wood and Graham finished 7th and 4th in the voting for MIP, respectively, Beard's ballot stands out.  

That said, there are some real head scratchers in these results. For example, I cant think of a single case for Drummond or Whiteside to be on someone's DPOY ballot unless you only play fantasy basketball. 

*** 

Without further delay, here is the table of all 100 media members, ranked by their “Total Contrarian Score” along with which ballot they cast that was most contrarian relative to the consensus.

To me he just looks like he’s running around like a wild animal and not actually shutting guys down.

1077,82,"Chris Paul hasn't won in the playoffs, but he's no choker","""Chris Paul has turned the Thunder into the Chris Paul-iest team he’s ever been on, providing a glimpse of both his greatness and his hamartia. In the deeper levels of the playoffs, there are players who can do things that Paul simply can’t. No matter how furiously Paul labors, he’ll never be able to draw from the raw ability and athleticism of Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook or Stephen Curry. If the members of the NBA’s pantheon are the Avengers, Chris Paul is Hawkeye — a superhero by any definition who, compared to his peers, is ultimately just a dude with a bunch of pointy sticks. Tellingly, the only times Paul has had any modicum of playoff success in the last decade, he’s deferred to more talented teammates like Blake Griffin and James Harden.

At 35 years old, it’s unlikely that Paul will somehow discover the secret to winning in the postseason. Years of bad luck and bad losses have branded Paul a choker, which is probably unfair. Paul hasn’t choked — not only are his postseason stats fairly bulletproof, but choking would imply that he somehow underperformed, when really Paul’s entire career has been a world-historic overperformance.  He’s been as good as any undersized point guard who can’t get to the rim could ever possibly be — but that, ultimately, will never be good enough. Paul is the NBA’s most tragic hero, doomed to a fate that has been predetermined by his own body. Wish him well.""

1078,83,LeBron and the Lakers Adjusting to Miami's Elongated Hedges (it's a game of chess),"I'm going to be breaking down how LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers adjusted to the Miami Heat's elongated hedges on pick and rolls in Game 4.

(Note: uploading videos and images isn't allowed in this subreddit,  so I've dropped links to the videos instead. If you'd like to view this post with embedded videos, [you can do so here](https://mediumlights.substack.com/p/lebron-and-the-lakers-adjusting-to).)

\---

Through four games in the 2020 NBA Finals, we've watched four *very* different games. In summary:

* Game 1 - Bam Adebayo and Goran Dragic's injuries knocked them out of their game plan, and LA's size and physicality dominated Miami all-around.
* Game 2 - The shorthanded Heat played a lot of zone. The Lakers once again killed them on the glass. LeBron and company hunted Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro on defense, and Robinson had such a poor game that he was benched for the entire fourth quarter.
* Game 3 - Jimmy Butler took advantage of the Lakers' switches and had a performance for the ages. On the other side of the floor, Miami retired the zone and played LA straight up. They fronted Anthony Davis, packed the paint, and began utilizing elongated hedges to avoid switching Robinson/Herro onto LeBron.
* Game 4 - LA began defending Jimmy the same way Miami defended LeBron in Game 3: they went under, hedged, and didn't give him any favorable switches (the few times it did happen, LA sent double teams to get the ball out of Butler's hands). On the other side, the Heat stuck with their plan from the previous game and LeBron and the Lakers started picking their spots to take advantage of it.

In this post, I'm going to specifically highlight the LeBron vs. Robinson matchup from Games 2-4.

If I had to choose one play to exemplify what happened in Game 2, this one would be it:

[https://youtu.be/MuaFIWkMmAE](https://youtu.be/MuaFIWkMmAE)

So in Game 3, when the Heat went to a man-to-man look, one of their top priorities was not getting Robinson switched onto LeBron. They found success by having Duncan hard hedge way out and LeBron's man go under the screen so he had time to recover. For example:

[https://youtu.be/KJ3fIegU-HE](https://youtu.be/KJ3fIegU-HE)

Another example:

[https://youtu.be/AewaAVv3vMY](https://youtu.be/AewaAVv3vMY)

In Game 4, Miami stuck with the same scheme. So LeBron and Frank Vogel pulled out a few counters to it. I’ll focus on two of them that stuck out to me.

The first, this double side pick-and-roll that had Danny Green slipping out to the corner for a wide open 3:

[https://youtu.be/nHieoThVCaE](https://youtu.be/nHieoThVCaE)

The second, LeBron splitting the pick-and-roll to attack the basket (he probably saves these for late in close games as it's obviously not something he can repeatedly do):

[https://youtu.be/rhq0mURkfhg](https://youtu.be/rhq0mURkfhg)

I'm really enjoying this chess match between two great teams.

On a related note, this is why some players are better suited for playoff basketball than others. The later you get into the postseason, the more valuable teams and players that are versatile and well-coached, have high-IQ, and can make adjustments on the fly are. Because your opponent will have several games and days to study you, do everything they can to take away everything you're good at, and find and attack your weakness(es).

Just in these last four Finals games against the Heat, and often many times over the course of a single game, LeBron has seen:

* the 2-3 zone
* the 3-2 zone
* switches
* short shows
* long hedges
* post defenders play him straight up
* fronts
* double teams

It's pretty ludicrous how easy he makes adjusting in real-time to whatever the defense is giving and taking away from him look. He rarely forces things or makes costly mistakes. A bonafide savant.

We really don’t need those bottom 10 teams when crunch time starts, every game counts when the bubble starts. So the whiny ass owners don’t cry let them run a losers bracket tournament, somehow tie it to a draft pick or something so we don’t see teams just tanking for nothing.

Does anyone have a good suggestion for a way to decrease this stoppage time while still maintaining the fair judgement that reviews and challenges provide?",nbadiscussion

1085,90,Cutting is the most efficient way to score in basketball. That means having players that can hit cutters is the most valuble skill in basketball. It's why Steve Nash won MPV's over Shaq,"I was reading this [OC post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cwml9a/oc_introducing_a_measure_of_shooting_efficiency/) yesterday and it got me thinking.  When you look at the numbers, cuts by every measurement is the most efficient way to score the basketball.   Thus any player that can generate the most cutting opportunities becomes the most efficient player in the game.   That efficiency becomes value over time.  

At first, this logic seems pretty straight forward.  Oh of course cuts are the most efficient way to score, so what?  It doesn't really matter, does it?  In fact, It matters far more than we give credit for.  Look throughout history.  MJ back in the 80s, Lost in the first round 3 years in a row.  Until of course the Bulls added Phil Jackson who installed the triangle. A system of using a players talent and gravity in the post to generate cutting opportunities.   With that system, MJ won 3 straight Championships twice.   Look at Bill Russell's success over Wilt.  Russell played team basketball with passing while wilt played iso ball with him getting all the stats.  Wilt didn't win more championships because his teams didn't generate cuts.   

Cutting stats also explain some of the weird things we see in defensive plus-minus stats.  Why is it Danny Green is so much more impactful in DRPM than Klay Thomson when we can clearly see with our eyes Klay is good at defense?  The answer is Cutting defense.   cutting is the most efficient way for a team to score, so preventing cutting opportunities becomes the most important skill defensily a player could have.    Klay Thomason is a great on-ball defender, but we tend not to notice his off-ball defense.  While Green is a good, not great on-ball defender but his off-ball preventing cuts is something we never even think about.  Still though, because preventing off-ball cuts is so important Danny Green DRPM stats show a far greater impact.   

All this leads me to say.  Nikola Jokic will be MVP in 2020.   Having a big man that can hit cutters like steve nesh while also having big man value combined leads him to be the most valuable player in the game.    We've already seen how Jokic was able to lead the often injured Nuggets to the second seed in the west as the only all-star.   Given a healthy Gary Harris, one of the best cutters in the game, Jokic will lead the Nuggets to 60+ wins and win his first of many MVPs.  This logic is also why team USA is going to lose to Serbia by 20.",nbadiscussion
1086,91,Why does Paul George keep getting a pass?,"Westbrook deservedly should be getting some of the blame for 3 consecutive 1st round exits, but PG the past two post seasons seems to have gotten no shit for it.

This past playoffs against portland, he played TERRIBLE games 1-4, shooting something like 36% including a 19% FG showing in game 3, where Russ won the game for them. It was only until game 5 PG shot 70% that made his end stats look passable. I guess because of recency bias, people forget about his earlier games?

The year prior to that where OKC lost to a rookie Donovan Mitchell, PG also didn’t play well, shooting 40% for the series, and putting up a whopping 5 points in the closeout game 6 while Russ went for 46 (albeit on bad shooting). 

In Indiana, I also hate the narrative of “PG went head to head with Lebron”. I mean in 2013 he didn’t even play better than Roy Hibbert in the ECF. 

As a side note, I also have no clue how PG stayed in the MVP conversation by the end of the season, even finishing 3rd. OKC had sub 50 wins and was the 6th seed, one loss away from 8th. He didn’t best Giannis or Harden in points, rebounds, or assists, and IMO wasn’t a better defender than Giannis. And trash Russ all you want but PG still played with another all nba player/ former MVP,  and solid pieces like Grant, Adams, Schroder, etc, which is arguably as good if not more than what Giannis and Harden had. I wouldn’t have had PG over Jokic or Lillard. And I get he got injured but it doesn’t change the fact he was only spectacular for like 2 months. His “career season” was an average to below average one by Lebron or KD standards.

1087,92,"""The NBA’s problems are unfixable. It’s a social media driven league that answers to Twitter users. It’s also a bad regular season product. The games do not matter. Seeding has little to no impact in the playoffs. And, more importantly, three teams matter at most each season.""","This is an excerpt from Bobby Burack's [weekly sports media mailbag](https://www.outkickthecoverage.com/media-mailbag-nba-stephen-a-ben-shapiro/). He answered 2 NBA related questions. 

“Do you expect NBA ratings to ever recover or will cord cutting prevent it from ever happening?”

I don’t fault cord-cutting as much as others. Cord-cutting has negatively impacted all TV products but the NBA was the only league that has nosedived the past two seasons.

The NBA’s problems are unfixable. It’s a social media driven league that answers to Twitter users. It’s also a bad regular season product. The games do not matter. Seeding has little to no impact in the playoffs. And, more importantly, three teams matter at most each season.

The vast majority of the storylines before the conference finals are a waste of time. And fans have grown to realize that. Streaks and momentum are so meaningless that star players take games off to manage the load. If they don’t care, why would the fans?

My prediction for the NBA playoffs would have been higher if the season would’ve resumed sooner. Now, the marquee playoff matchups and the Finals are going to occur during football season. The NBA is used to owning the months of May and June; they’ll now share September and October. Not just with football, but with election coverage and debates.

The viewership for the Finals last season wasn’t kind (down nearly 14%) — I don’t see it going up much this year.

“Do you ever see Fox, NBC, or CBS getting NBA games or is the NBA too married to Disney?”

I love this transition. While I’m not high on the NBA’s viewership trajectory, it’s still live sports. Meaning, networks value it.

Disney is, as you said, married to the NBA. I’d be shocked if the ESPN/ABC package decreases at all when the deal expires after the 2024-25 season. It’s the Turner package I find fascinating. Adam Silver publically called the cable TV model “broken” in 2019. Turner only has cable channels and can’t fix that problem. NBC, FOX, and CBS can.

If the NBA shifts its season to a December start, it’s Thursday night games go from getting crushed by Thursday Night Football to relevant. FOX could seamlessly air the NBA on Thursdays as soon as football season ends, if it were to poach the package away from Turner. Basketball fans have long wished the NBA would return to NBC. NBC’s production of the NBA was widely considered the league’s best. NBC, like FOX, would give the NBA a boost airing on broadcast TV. CBS strikes me as an odd fit. But it would have the same impact.

Also, Sam Amico tweeted that he agreed with Bobby that cord cutting isn't the reason the NBA is losing ratings.

Bomani Jones spent many tweets about this issue, saying ""nba's got this weird thing where it seems more popular than ever but can't get eyeballs on tv. what i find strange is people who can only enjoy sports if the game ""matters."" but that's me. apparently, many of you require stakes on everything."" an ""now, there is one thing the nba can't fix, and i can understand the negative effect this would have on the regular season -- the team that went 73-9 didn't win the title.""

Now there are many theories for why ratings are decreasing

1. Cord Cutting

2. Regular season doesn't matter enough (though why doesn't this apply to MLB and NHL?)

3. Lack of parity/ only a 3 teams have a chance at the title

4. Players political stance. Many people believe that the NBA is a ""woke"" league

5. Load Management",nbadiscussion
1088,93,[OC] How often every NBA official calls the most common fouls relative to their peers,"tl;dr: Using data from the 2019-20 regular season, I analyzed how many times each referee called the different types of common fouls. [This chart shows how often (relative to their peers) each foul was called by each referee.](https://imgur.com/ndCP8D7)


*** 

In today's NBA everything that can be tracked is tracked. But the one thing I've always wanted that doesnt seem to exist anywhere is a clearinghouse for data on NBA officials. What I mean by that is a place where you can find out which refs call which fouls more (or less) often than their peers. So I did it myself. 

Using play-by-play data from every game for the 2019-20 regular season I tallied every foul call and noted the referee who called it. In doing so, I was able to see exactly what I've always wondered: Do certain referees call certain fouls differently than their peers? 

[This chart](https://imgur.com/a/ggZdGsR) shows how often each referee who officiated at least 30 games called the eight most common types of fouls (technically, the ""kicked ball"" violation is among the eight most common fouls/violations, but a kicked ball is a little more cut and dry and not as interesting to look at so I swapped it for the defensive 3 seconds violation, which I believe is a little more telling of a referees foul calling tendencies). The higher the bar on the chart for the referee, the more fouls of that type they call relative to their peers. 

Note that the ""Personal Take"" fouls is just an intentional foul that you often see at the end of games. 

In order to create this chart what I had to do was convert the number of times a referee called a foul (on a per game basis) and convert it to a percentile so that I could show all 8 types of fouls on the same chart. That's because shooting and personal fouls are called a lot more often than Defensive Three Seconds. There are some downsides to showing the data this way (extreme outliers are not as obvious), but I think it's pretty informative overall. 

Note that the referees are sorted in this chart by their average percentile across all eight common fouls. Sean Wright (shown as ""S Wright"" for reasons that are explained in the methodology at the end) had an average percentile of 77, which was just above Scott Foster's average of 75. On the opposite end of the spectrum you have Brandon Adair and Ashley Moyer-Gleich who on average call fouls much more infrequently rate than their peers. 

Is there anyway teams could use this data? I think so. If you know the officials who are assigned to your game call far fewer defensive three seconds calls than you can maybe push the envelope there and tell your big men to linger in the paint longer than they're typically allowed. Similarly, if you know an official calls more three point shooting fouls than their peers than you encourage your shooters to sell any and all contact on jump shots. 

I know that the first chart can be sort of tough to read, [so I also put together this album of 58 individual charts for the 58 refs. This give a little clearer picture for what percentile they score in.](https://imgur.com/a/25pQl6b)

Lastly, if you're more of a table-person, I'll post the data that way as well:

##Some Methodology Notes: 

This data comes from the NBA's play-by-play data, which is pretty unhelpful and messy. Each play is accompanied by a description, which in the case of a foul includes the name of the official who made the call (e.g., ""[PHI] Embiid Foul: Loose Ball (1 PF) (S Foster)""). Unfortunately, it only includes the first initial and last name of the official and there are two officials that go by J. Goble (John Goble and Jacyn Goble), so I've excluded them from this analysis since I have no way of telling them apart.

I started out by calculating the total number of each foul called by each ref. But because some refs officiated upwards of 60 games while others officiated less than 10 I had to convert the total to a per game amount. In addition, in order to show different types of fouls on the same chart I standardized each foul on a 1 - 99 scale. So the referee that called the most shooting fouls per game would be ranked 99th and the ref that called the fewest shooting fouls per game would be rank 1st. The same goes for personal fouls, technical fouls, goaltending, and so on and so forth.

Lastly, even though there are more than two dozen types of fouls/violations I decided to show just the 8 most common ones. Technically ""Kicked ball violation"" is in the top 8 but I swapped it for Defensive 3 Seconds since it tends to be more subjective.

This chart was made in R with the help of ggplot2

Limitations
I'm sure referees have positions or different responsibilities like in the NFL so by nature of where a ref is positioned on the court they may be more likely to call certain types fouls. In addition, each crew has a head ref who I imagine is responsible for calling obvious fouls (like intentional fouls) that all three refs see.

1089,94,Could the increase in 3-1 comebacks in the last decade be a side effect of the 3 point era?,"The Nuggets' win last night marked the fifth 3-1 comeback in the last 6 playoffs, something that had only happened once or twice in any other decade in the modern era. I think this is due at least in part to an overall increase in competition as basically any team in the west playoffs seems to have a puncher's chance on any given night. However, does anybody else think this could be a result of an increase in three point-heavy offenses and the relative volatility of that shot as compared to inside scoring? Just as teams can often shoot themselves out of 20+ point deficits relatively quickly in the modern era, it sort of stands to reason that one team's shooters could heat up or cool off over a stretch of several games. This can happen much easier than an offense could ""heat up"" or ""cool off"" in any previous era when most shots were coming within 10 feet of the basket. Overall, it just seems like there's a bit more randomness added with the three pointer being featured so heavily. Obviously a pretty loose theory but I think it's worth considering, anyone know of any other factors that could be contributing to the sudden spike in 3-1 comebacks over the last few years?",nbadiscussion
1090,95,"Bill Simmons 10 ""unbreakable"" records","Here is a list of Bill Simmons' 10 unbreakable records in the NBA. (I believe this list is from 2008.)

1. Wilt's 50 point per game scoring average (season)
2. Wilt's 55 rebounds (game)
3. Russell's 11 rings (career)
4. Lakers 33 game win streak
5. George McInnis 422 turnovers (season)
6. Wilt's 100 points (game)
7. Chicago's 72 wins (season)
8. Skiles 30 assists (game)
9. Rasheed's 41 technicals (season)
10. Calderon's 98.1 free throw percentage (season)

Number 5 was broken by both Westbrook (438) and Harden (464) in 2016-17

Number 7 was broken by the Warriors in 2015-16 (73-9)

Clearly not all of these were actually unbreakable. out of the 8 remaining only 1 cannot be broken based on the rules.  Based on the current suspension rules for techs it is impossible to receive more than 36 in a season.  So barring a rule change #9 is actually impossible to beat.

Out of the remaining 7 I don't believe 4 of them will ever get broken.  #1, 2, 3, and 6. All of these were accomplished before 1970 when the game was very different. A faster pace and fewer teams then we have today.

That leaves us with 4, 8, and 10. I believe all of these reasonably can be broken.

The  Heat had 27 consecutive wins and the Warriors had 24 or 28 consecutive wins depending if you count the previous year or not. This all happened in the past 10 years. I don't think its impossible for a team to win just 6 more games.

John Stockton had 28 Assists only 16 days after Skiles' record of 30. That is still the closest anyone has gotten, but in the past 10 years Rondo had a 23, a 24, and a 25 assist game. Westbrook also had a 24 assist game. 30 is not so far off. If a team hits a few more shots this record is breakable.

98.1% is incredible. Calderon went 151/154 from the line. As hard as this seems to beat he is a career 87.3% free throw shooter. There are players better than that. If Curry, Redick, or Lillard go on a hot streak to start a season and then get injured after hitting enough to qualify this record can be broken.

I am not saying that any of these will be broken but I think that these last 3 all have a possibility of being broken. Who knows it may happen this year or maybe not for another 25 years.

Do you disagree on any of my thoughts? Can 1,2,3 or 6 be broken? Is 4,8, or 10 actually unbreakable?",nbadiscussion
1091,96,3 Players Who Could Shock the World in 2019-2020,"**Monte Morris Was Not Even a Top 500 Player Last Season**

Ranked the 505th overall player in 2017-2018 (just behind James Young and Xavier Mumford) Morris etched his name in the Nuggets' rotation early and never looked back. He was a fringe top 100 player this past season and although very talented the one skill that got him to that point was a ridiculous IQ. His assist/turnover ratio is borderline legendary at 3.6 APG/0.6 TPG. That was what he was known for in college as well.

**Here Is a Fact**

There's the LeBron's, the Curry's, Embiid, Giannis. ***If a player is outside of this group and wants to stick around the NBA for a long time, having one specific skill is the best way to do this.***

This could be ANY skill, and I don't mean just on the court. Let me give an example of this:

Jason Smith has been in the NBA since 2007 and on first glance I have zero idea how in the hell Jason Smith has been in the NBA since 2007.

Then I read an article in The Athletic after Smith was traded to Milwaukee, and the Wizards' players were legitimately pissed off that Smith was traded. I'm not talking like ""oh whatever just another trade"" I mean they were prepared for a full blown mutiny.

Why was this? Smith (despite the absolute mess Washington was early on in the season) was friends with everybody in the locker room. He had a lot of positive energy and could easily move from group to group in terms of interactions. Everybody on the team loved him.

Here's my point: Smith's skill is being positive (okay being 7 feet tall helps too, but there's a lot of other 7 footers since 2007 that aren't in the NBA still. I mean who could have guessed Jason Smith would outlast Greg Oden? What even is this timeline?). It's better to be great at one thing than a jack of all trades..or if your LeBron just great at everything but that type of situation is 4 or 5 players out of everyone in the NBA at a time. Probably even less.

**There Will Be Players Next Season Who Not Many Fans Know About That Will Make a Name For Themselves**

Here are examples of that this past season:

*Monte Morris (2017-2018: 505) (2018-2019: Top 130)*

*Malik Beasley (2017-2018: 388) (2018-2019: Top 170)*

*Derrick White: (2017-2018: 398) (2018-2019: Top 170)*

*Thomas Bryant (2017-2018: 466) (2018-2019: Top 190)*

*Derrick Jones Jr (2017-2018: 457) (2018-2019: Top 250)*

5 Players, who spent time in the G-League last year, none ranked higher than the 388th player in the NBA and all made major leaps. All were crucial rotation players during this season.

A few more examples exist, my point is there is a near definite possibility that 5-10 players in 2019-2020 will come out of no where to be important rotation players. There are players who will have been grinding it out with little recognition and their time comes.

**So Here are 3 Players Who Could Shock the NBA in 2019-2020**

I don't mean make a regular or semi-expected jump in progression. I mean quite literally going from hardly any NBA fans (even some regular r/nba or r/nbadiscussion posters) knowing who you are to making an immediate impact in the NBA.

These players I feel very strongly about upon much review. *One of them I believe has top 100, if not 50 overall NBA potential within the next couple of years.* There are more I think will progress but I've narrowed this list down to 3.

**1. Tony Bradley (Utah Jazz)**

If there will be a Monte Morris of next year, Tony Bradley is my overwhelming favorite to be an immediate impact player in the NBA.

I truly believe the Utah Jazz think they have a major hidden gem on their hands and are ready to unleash him next year.

**I will even go as far to say that at the current rate of progression Tony Bradley could be a top 100 NBA player in 2-3 years.**

A late 1st round pick in 2017 (and a favorite of mine at the time) that simply needed a few years. He had beautiful long term potential but everything hadn't come together yet.

He's a 7 footer who's athletic and has always had the defensive ability (1.2 BPG since 2017 in the G-League). Where he developed this year is his offense.

The Jazz experimented with moving him out of the post and all of a sudden Bradley (who was limited to the post) has become the unlikeliest of 3 point shooters. He did only shoot 26% this past season, but he's shooting 1 a game and has made clear development from the previous season.

Not to mention, in the last game of the NBA season dude put up 15 points/10 rebounds/2 blocks/2 steals against the Clippers.

**He is only 21 years old.** Bradley is just one month older than 2019 projected 1st round pick Rui Hachimura.

The Jazz also quite literally do not have a viable backup center to Rudy Gobert right now, and I'm not kidding when I say if Bradley develops the way I think he might **the potential is there for him to be even better than Gobert.**

Sounds crazy? Bradley is the same age right now Gobert was when he was drafted. He has similar defensive potential and is already more versatile on offense than Gobert is right now.

Now, Gobert is a top 3 defensive player and has been the last couple of years. I'm just saying in terms of potential Bradley is further along than Rudy is at the same age.

**2. Wade Baldwin IV (Portland Trail Blazers)**

Anfernee Simons is young and I think learned a lot behind Damian Lillard in his first year in the NBA, and I see an obvious move up the success ladder next season.

Baldwin IV is not on the Trail Blazers anymore, but currently the starting point guard for the Toronto Raptors' G-League affiliate. **I can assure you Toronto is keeping a close eye on him, and I will go as far to say I expect Baldwin IV to be in the Raptors rotation in 2019-2020.**

I think the Raptors are well set up for success clearly but there is a point guard problem behind Kyle Lowry. Fred VanVleet is good enough (although inconsistent) but after that there is a mess. Jeremy Lin doesn't play at all and although this is not a major issue whatsoever, there is an opening for an opportunity next year.

Baldwin IV was a 1st round pick in 2016 by Memphis and for good reason: his physical skills as a point guard were Westbrook-esque. But he was immature, and has floated through the wind the last 3 seasons.

Here's the catch though: he still has the physical skills, has matured, and improved a lot in 2018-2019. In the G-League he averaged 22 PPG, 5 RPG, 4 APG. Good enough, but where he really progressed that makes him stand out his his FG PCT.

*2016-2018: 43% FG, 27% 3 Point in G-League*

*This Season: 48% FG, 35% 3 Point in G-League*

He's always had the physical skills and his efficiency improved from mediocre to excellent.

Still only 23 years old he is in an excellent position, there will be a spot open on Toronto's roster for him to have a chance at the rotation, and I would go as far to say the chances he does get a spot are likely.

**3. Angel Delgado (LA Clippers)**

The G-League Rookie of the Year has one beautiful skill and that's rebounding.

**He averaged 15 rebounds a game.**

Delgado was also a 1st team all G-League player and averaged 11 RPG in 4 years at Seton Hall.

His offensive game is developing as well. 19 PPG on 62% shooting and a slowly developing 3 point shot.

At 6'10, 245 pounds he has NBA level size to match with his skillset.

Having only played 2 games in the NBA this past season, Delgado was outside of my overall top 500. Similar to Morris last year.

But like Morris, he has one very crystal clear NBA level skill and that's rebounding. It's a skill that could give him an 8-10 year career in the NBA as a valuable role player.

Delgado is older than the other 2 prospects mentioned (turns 25 in November) but I could easily see him in the Clippers' rotation next season.",nbadiscussion
1092,97,Opponents have shot 41/50 (82%) when Zion Williamson is the primary defender at the rim.,"[Source tweet](https://twitter.com/FearTheBrown/status/1235586612219781121?s=20)

How does this change your projection of Zion as a defender in the NBA ? (My thoughts below)

First off , to be clear this isn’t a hate post by any means. But one of the most interesting open questions about Zion Williamson is whether he would more successfully translate to the NBA as an interior defender/small ball C (ala Draymond) or more of a strong forward who can defend wings, or maybe something else entirely. Playing defense in CBB is so different from the NBA and its hard to project how players will develop. 

So far , over this small sample size it appears Zion has struggled to deter shots at the rim when playing center. Furthermore his current block rate of 1.2% would pale in comparison to players such as Draymond Green (2.9%) or Robert Covington (2.3%) who have made a living as small ball Cs. 

Why? Well one of the secrets about being a rim protector is that vertical leap only matters to a certain point. NBA players are taught to go into the chest of a shotblocker on drives, because once you hit them in the chest the big man will recoil from the contact and can’t time their jump with you. Thus the best shotblockers have a long wingspan and standing reach, so they’re able to use verticality and contest shots without needing to elevate that high. Draymond and RoCo were blessed with 7’3 + wingspans which simply can’t be replicated by jumping ability. 

This is why I believe that Zion, despite having otherworldly athleticism that can cover up for a lot, may ultimately be limited as a pure rim protector due to his middling wingspan/reach. 

What do you all think? Can Zion achieve still DPOY type of defensive potential as a small ball 5? Would he be better as a forward defender guarding big wings like Lebron/Kawhi/Simmons/Tatum etc? Or maybe we can just chalk this up to rookie struggles and still believe he can develop into that all-around generational defender?",nbadiscussion

- 🟢 **Efficient volume-scorer**; ***""Jimmy G. Buckets, The 'G' stands for 'Gets'""***: 21.6 Points/75 on 58.5 TS% *(+2.0 rTS%)* in the regular-season, 23.8 Points/75 on 63.0 TS% *(+5.7 rTS%)* in the playoffs thus far

Butler finished the regular-season as Miami's leading scorer. He's highly resourceful at racking up points, utilising strength, speed, craft, handles, and deft touch in the paint to compensate for a jumper that deserts him on occasion. [Per Basketball Index](https://i.imgur.com/QiSOVUy.png), Butler is in the 95th-percentile at off-ball movement and finishing among wings, and in the 93rd percentile for post-scoring.

**Jimmy Buckets's scoring-breakdown by zone in the 2019-20 regular-season:** [*(per stats.nba.com)*](https://i.imgur.com/6tIi3pE.png)

- - 38% of his shot attempts come in the restricted area, where he's finishing at an above-average rate for forwards (64 FG%)

- - 24% of his shot attempts come in the non-restricted area of the paint *(a.k.a. ""floater range"")*, where he's also scoring at above-average rate (43.4 FG%)

- - 22% of his shot attempts come from the midrange, where he's unfortunately shot at the [2nd-worst rate](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hbbups/midrange_mastery/) in the league (31.7 FG%)

- - 16% of his shot attempts come from 3, where he's shooting at the worst rate in the league (24.8 FG%)

Jimmy uses his strength/speed/footwork combination to bulldoze or finesse his way to the rim and finish through contact, capable of athletic finishes through multiple defenders. When in the post/paint, Jimmy utilises hesitation moves and jab steps effectively, has an effective handle, excellent at keeping defenders on his hips before exploding forward and finishing either at the rim or a bit further out, with a nice little floater off two feet to finish over shotblockers. Butler is also highly physical, using his body to create space - he dips his shoulders on drives, throwing his momentum *into* his defender's body; he doesn't lack craft, however, using ball fakes and spins a *lot* (he even throws a spin-fake in there sometimes!).

To quote the great [Evin Gualberto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paNd22qEls8):

>*(Butler's) foundation is his phenomenal footwork. He’s got the poise and patience to pivot and pump, and twist, and then rip through and power to the paint. He can use his force or finish with finesse; he’ll go any way he needs in order to get to the basket, whether that’s under the defender, over, around, or even through them. He’s got the ability to hit from distance, his post game is pretty with the pristine pivoting he does, but he can also go full bully ball. Speaking of, he’s an absolute bull when he wants to get to the rim. He can score any kind of way, so as a defense, all you have to do is make him take the toughest shot possible…the only problem is, yeah, he can make those with worryingly regularity as well. He is Jimmy G Buckets after all, the G stands for gets.*

**In previous years**, Jimmy has been a decent 3-point-shooter *(36 3P% in the previous 3 seasons, on 3.2 3PA/game)* and has generally shot in the high 30s from midrange, which isn't fantastic but is still a value-add to his versatility as a scorer.

**In the playoffs thus far**, however, Butler has been money on his jumpshots, connecting on over half his threes (though on low volume - 1.8 3PA/game) and 42% of his midrange shots (again, low volume - 12 midrange attempts) so far.

**As an overall scorer, Jimmy is:** 

- -  A hyper-competent and -active cutter ^((8% of his possessions, 97th percentile efficiency)^) 

- -  Fantastic in transition ^((12% of his possessions, 92nd percentile efficiency)^) 

- -  A competent post-operator ^((7% of his possessions, 80th percentile efficiency)^) 

- -  A passable PnR finisher ^((36% of his possessions, 56th percentile efficiency)^) 

- -  Solid in isolation situations, likely buoyed by his very good rim-finishing ^((10% of his possessions, 68th percentile)^)

- -  Below-average scoring from spot-up scenerios and handoffs

Despite his jumpshot having deserted him in the regular season, Jimmy ekes out efficient scoring options via drawing fouls and very solid rim-finishing in transition, isolation, and by cutting often and decisively. To quote Zach Lowe:

>*(Butler) can blend into a broader offensive system as a shoulder-checking cutter, and supersede that system when the situation requires.*

Accordingly, 41% of Butler's buckets are assisted, a very solid rate for a primary ball-handler who had a non-existent jumpshot during the regular-season, that showcases his off-ball activity as a ferocious cutter.

---

- 🟢 **Free-throw rate that would make Shaq blush**

Jimmy Butler's foul-drawing rate this season has been, to put it mildly, something of an outlier. 

Butler is 29th in the NBA in Points/game (19.9), but *5th* in the NBA in FTA/game (9.1), and just to emphasize how absurdly often Butler's been finding his way to the line relative to his total shot attempts, here's a fun little table comparing Butler's FTA/game and Points/Game to the league's other elite free-throw-attempters: **[[TABLE]](https://i.imgur.com/bSnwHeb.png)**.

To try and add *even* more context, **Free Throw Rate (FTr)** is a very simple statistic that gives the ratio of free-throw attempts to field-goal attempts. 

**Just to ballpark the sort of numbers we expect from high-volume free-throw shooters**: famed foul-shot-aficionado James Harden's FTr this season is 0.528, meaning that he averages 0.528 free-throw attempts for every field-goal that he takes. (The Beard's career-high was 0.592, set in 2013.) Paint-destroyer Giannis Antetokounmpo has a FTr of 0.508 this year, and low-post monster Joel Embiid has a FTr of 0.543. A pretty dominant fella who went by the name of Shaquille had a career-average FTr of 0.578, averaging an incredible 0.653 in a 5-year span from 2001 to 2005.

Now, keeping all of this in mind ... Miami Heat All-Star wing **Jimmy Butler's Free-Throw Rate, in the 2019-20 season, is** ***0.693.*** 

(If you're wondering, Butler has more than managed to maintain this in the playoffs too -- after 6 games, Jimmy is *2nd* in the entire playoffs in Free-Throw Rate, posting a ludicrous ***0.810 FTr.*** Small sample size, obviously, but *wow*.)

---

- 🟢 **Good playmaker**

First, some numbers: 6.0 Assists/Game, 7.5 Passer Rating, 7.4 Box Creation. Miami have a fairly strong offense (+1.9 rORTG, 6th) which improves by +4.1 points with Butler on the court. Per [Basketball Index](https://twitter.com/The_BBall_Index/status/1235233543078293505), Jimmy is in the 91st percentile for playmaking among wings.

For a few seasons now, Jimmy has been a very solid passer and playmaker. Mimicking another former well-known Chicago wing who went by the name of Michael, Jimmy is a low-turnover player (career 1.5 TOV/game; this season: 2.2 TOV/Game, excellent 2.73 AST/TOV ratio). He is a decisive and relatively low-error ball-handler and shot-creator, hitting bigs and shooters well off PnR/DHO-action. Butler manipulates defenders with his eyes to unlock shots for teammates, and is also adept at punishing help defenders who have to react to his bruising drives to the rim by kicking to shooters and dropping it off to cutters. He's developed especially good chemistry with Bam (25% of Butler's 6.0 AST/game go to Adebayo), Duncan Robinson (who receives 17% of Butler's assists), and rookie Kendrick Nunn (18%).

- 🟢 **Excellent defender**

Jimmy at his peak is easily an all-league defensive talent, with tremendous instincts and effort on D, generally remaining incredibly active on that end both on- and off-the-ball. Miami's 12th-ranked defense (-1.0 rDRTG) improves by 1.0 points with Butler on the floor. Butler’s defensive awareness is top-tier, as is his lateral quickness - he's comfortable chasing speedy guards around the court; Jimmy is also [uber-switchable for his size](https://i.imgur.com/1MKtxZO.png), guarding positions 1-4 at least 18% of the time each, and guarding centers for 10% of his possessions, when switched onto bigs in Miami small-ball lineups. Jimmy is in the [82nd percentile of post defenders](https://stats.nba.com/players/playtype-post-up/?SeasonType=Regular%20Season&CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*Jimmy%20Butler&TypeGrouping=defensive), fantastic given his position, and players shoot a whopping 4.4% worse on 3s when Butler's the closest defender, demonstrating his defensive engagement and closeout-speed. Butler is a very physical defender as well, often ""bodying-up"" larger players the post, Marcus Smart-style, crowding their space and making scoring uncomfortable.

To again quote [Evin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz5LhrjnbDs):

>*(Butler's) ability to stand up powerful post-up players, coupled with the quickness to stick with the shiftiest wings, and the instincts and IQ to know when to stay down and when to jump to contest, make him a dynamite defender... (he) frustrates opponents with foot speed and anticipating with active hands, he’ll blow up pick and rolls, or send his man one way only to remarkably beat him to that same spot. You’ll see jumping in passing lanes, but you’ll also just see him holding his ground a lot; in one, he even holds Melo off with one arm while grabbing the rebound with the other. His intelligence shines through when he avoids getting screened and when he forced ball handlers into help.*

Butler is quite disruptive off-ball (7th in Deflections/Game, 7th in Steals/Game, 13th in Steal-%, 14th in loose-balls recovered/game), often jumping passing lanes or making crisp rotations to cut off offensive angles. He's also a [plus-rebounder for his position](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&CFID=&CFPARAMS=&PlayerID=202710&TeamID=1610612748&GameID=0021901295&ContextMeasure=REB&Season=2019-20&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&LeagueID=00&PlusMinus=N&PaceAdjust=N&Rank=N&Outcome=&Location=&Month=0&SeasonSegment=&OpponentTeamID=0&VsConference=&VsDivision=&GameSegment=&Period=0&LastNGames=0&DateFrom=&DateTo=&PORound=0&ShotClockRange=&PerMode=Totals&MeasureType=Base&section=player), snagging almost seven boards a game; the Heat's defensive-rebound-% [spikes by almost 3 percentage points with Butler on the court](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/butleji01/on-off/2020). He's generally very engaged on D, providing hard closeouts to shooters (players shoot almost 4.3% worse from 3 when Jimmy is the closest defender) and providing help when the primary Miami defender is beat. Along with Adebayo, Butler is one of the main reasons Miami's defense is still better than league-average even though many of their lineups prioritise shooting over defense (see: Robinson, Herro, Leonard, Olynyk).

Most defensive metrics (taken with a spoonful or two of salt, of course) think of Butler as a very solid positive on defense (+1.0 to +2.0); Basketball Index has Jimmy as the 4th-best Wing Stopper at [Passing Lane Defense](https://twitter.com/The_BBall_Index/status/1268686559605395456), and ranks him in the 90th percentile of perimeter defenders in the league overall. [It also has him](https://i.imgur.com/QiSOVUy.png) in the 71st percentile as a defensive rebounder, and in the 47th percentile as an interior defender.

#**🔴 The Not-As-Good:**

---

- 🔴 **Inconsistent jumpshot**

Butler suffered the [7th-biggest drop in the league in perimeter shooting grade](https://i.imgur.com/12rYwyx.png) from last year to this year (*per Basketball Index*). Famously, he was the [least efficient jump-shooter in the league by eFG%](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDt4AIrFRGy/?igshid=1p9hvin8383qh) in the regular-season.

As mentioned, though, his jumpshot *has* been very respectable in the bubble for now, albeit on very low volume.

- 🔴 **Room for improvement in some areas of scoring**

Namely: spot-up shooting, handoffs, and PnR scoring, all likely related to his regular-season shooting woes.


---

- 🔴 **Some areas of playmaking**

From my *very* limited film study (~15 games), Jimmy doesn't seem to try advanced passes often (though that might be a Miami Heat scheme-related issue), rarely slingshoting cross-court skip-passes to corner shooters like LeBron/Luka/Trae do (**please correct me if I'm wrong, Heat fans!**). He can occasionally miss cutters while hunting for the kickout pass for 3. Butler's delivery can sometimes be a bit wild or inaccurate as well. 

---

- 🔴 **Some areas of defense**

Jimmy's activity does dial down on occasion. He also lacks size/strength/length to defend larger wings consistently, and his gambles can blow up on him at times too when he's springing passing lanes, with the player he's supposed to be guarding getting an open 3 or cutting to the rim as Butler isn't there to recover in time. Jimmy is also vulnerable to size at the rim - despite posting one of the best block rates in the league for a guard/forward, these are mostly on smaller players and he doesn't seem to influence shot attempts at the rim too much in general - opponents shoot almost [6% *better*](https://stats.nba.com/player/202710/defense-dash/?Season=2019-20&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) within 6 feet of the hoop when Butler's the closest defender. It also *appears* that Butler's pick-and-roll defense may have some room for improvement as well ([46th percentile](https://stats.nba.com/players/ball-handler/#!?SeasonType=Regular%20Season&TypeGrouping=defensive&CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*Jimmy%20Butler) in defending PnR ball-handlers), he may have trouble negotiating man and ball occasionally.

---

- 🔴 **A few** ***regular-season*** **clutch woes**

Jimmy shot [45.1 TS%](https://stats.nba.com/players/clutch-advanced/?sort=GP&dir=-1&Season=2019-20&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*Jimmy%20Butler) in the clutch this season, with a -10.4 individual clutch net rating, while Miami as a team were [24th](https://stats.nba.com/teams/clutch-advanced/?sort=NET_RATING&dir=-1&Season=2019-20&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) in clutch net rating.

**However**, the team still broke even in the wins column (18-18) and had a 14-10 clutch record when Butler played.

In addition, I say ""regular-season"" for a reason (keep in mind the usual ""low sample size"" asterisk, of course): Miami have been the 4th-*best* clutch team in the **playoffs** by net rating, winning all 3 of their close games so far, while Jimmy himself is sporting a blistering hot 88.7 clutch TS% and +29.8 clutch net rating at the moment, with an absolutely scorching ***+137.5*** clutch offensive rating. 

---

- 🔴 **Few durability questions**

Jimmy G. Buckets (the 'G.' stands for 'Gets') has played >67 games only twice in his 9-year career. 

**HOWEVER**, he's been very available for the Heat this season, missing 'only' 11 games. 

Indeed, Butler played heavy minutes in his last playoff run for Philadelphia (38mpg in 2nd round) as well, performing admirably in a razor-close loss to the eventual champion Raptors in the 2nd round (22/7/6 on 56ts%, +1.0rTS%, vs Toronto), very nearly pulling through a Sixers team otherwise starved of late-game offensive-creation into the Conference Finals.

1094,99,[OC] DeMar Derozan is the only player in TOP 30 in points who hasn't scored a three pointer yet. His shot chart is still blazing hot,"Of course, DeMar Derozan. 

He took only 4 three point shots and hasn't made a single one of them. Because of that I decided to take a look at his [shotchart](https://i.imgur.com/ZEIjXPl.png).

He is on fire in mid-range this year. His overall FG% is at his career high 53%. That is 5% higher than last year's percentage, 48% which was already a sign of him fitting perfectly in Spurs' system.

He really excells in Spurs' system. And offense isn't really an issue for Spurs but their defense is. It is nice to see one NBA team not falling into trend of shooting a bunch of three pointers each game.

The shotchart is created using Python and matplotlib, all of the data comes from [stats.nba.com](https://stats.nba.com/) and is retrieved using awesome python package called [nba_api](https://github.com/swar/nba_api/).

1096,101,Raymond Lewis: The best player to never play in the NBA,"I wanted to spell out why I think LA legend Raymond Lewis is THE best player who never played in the NBA. In this type of discussion, you want to pay particular attention to players who were successful in the most NBA-like settings against the most highly talented players (*hopefully with as much documentation as possible*), and in all of these regards Lewis truly differentiates himself. Here we go:

* Lewis was named by HOF coach Jerry Tarkanian as the greatest player he'd ever seen in [his book](https://www.powells.com/book/runnin-rebel-9781613212141).
* Similarly, Lewis was named as the best player ever (*specifically noted as better than Jordan*) by Freeman Williams, the #2 all-time college scorer in D1 history and NBA vet from 1978-1986.
* Lewis was a HS mega-star in the LA area from '69-71 with absurd team and statistical success, received 250+ college scholarship offers (*including UCLA in the middle of their 10-titles-in-12-years stretch*), choosing to attend Cal State LA due to ~~a new car and lots of money~~ their commitment to his recruitment. Supposedly he dropped 52 points on a group of LA Lakers in a summer league game *while still in high school*.
* Lewis played 1 year at Cal State LA, averaged 33 ppg and lead an upset over the #3 team in the country (*Long Beach State, lead by 4 future pros*) by scoring 53 points. On the freshmen team, he had averaged 39 ppg, including 73 in one game. His 39 ppg on the freshmen team was tops in the country, just ahead of David Thompson.
* He was an extraordinary ball handler and was tremendously dynamic/explosive, plus he was a great shooter -- completely unstoppable on offense. Hall of Fame PG Dick McGuire, who was the Knicks' chief scout at the time, said this in 1973: ""*Raymond Lewis has more raw basketball talent than any college player in the country, and that includes Bill Walton. He scares you, he has so much ability.*"" 
* He was picked in the 1st round of the 1973 draft by the Sixers (*youngest 1st round draft pick ever at the time*), who had also chosen fellow guard Doug Collins with the #1 overall pick. In a summer scrimmage, Lewis scored 60 points against Collins. *In the first half.* The coach cancelled the second half so Collins' confidence wouldn't go in the toilet. This was documented in the newspapers; it's not some playground myth. All the local papers were reporting that Lewis was much better than their #1 overall pick, plus that Lewis was a good defender. Both were combo guards, and Collins became a 4x All-Star before injuries ended his career.
* Lewis tried to get more money from Philly, they wouldn't budge, so he left and they blackballed him from ever playing in the NBA or ABA. This is why he never made the league -- not legal issues or drugs.
* Lewis spent years trying to get into the league, making a huge splash in multiple summer leagues, including averaging 54 ppg in the summer of ‘81, plus scoring 63 and 81 points in two different games while playing in the Spurs’ camp one year.
* Michael Cooper, one of the 80’s best defensive guards (*8x All-D, ‘87 DPOTY*) was tasked with guarding 30-year-old Lewis during a 1983 summer league game when Lewis was still trying to make a bid to get into the league. Lewis scored 56 points in 3 quarters on Cooper.
* [Here's a 3-min trailer for a documentary](https://vimeo.com/92586014) about Lewis that is coming out next year. It contains some college game film showing how elite of a driver and shooter he was, plus some interview snippets (*including with Tarkanian and Cooper*).


Here are the other primary ""best player never to play in the NBA"" candidates:

**INTERNATIONAL PLAYERS:** I know **Oscar Schmidt** is brought up often in these types of discussions, but he's a bit overrated because of his scoring records. Similar to Reggie Miller, he was a great spot-up shooter, but not much else -- weak passer, weak defender, weak driver, not much of a rebounder. Sure he scored 24 points against the Dream Team in 1992, but he took 25 shots to do it ([box score](https://www.basketball-reference.com/olympics/games/1992-07-31-USA-BRA)). I'm going with the International expertise of u/lavta (*[super informative post](https://old.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/cv8ez6/best_players_to_have_never_played_in_the_nba/)*) and saying the best International player who never saw the NBA was **Sergei Belov**, the legendary Russian SG who seemingly scored and won at will from '66-80, including scoring WAY more points than anyone else in the famous 1972 USA-USSR gold medal game ([box score](https://www.basketball-reference.com/olympics/games/1972-09-09-USA-URS)). He was 6-ft-3 and had all the SG skills a player would want (*shooting, ball-handling, craftiness, footwork, floaters, good passer*), plus Belov was super clutch and took/made tough, contested shots. Special shout outs to centers Kresimir Cosic and Dino Meneghin, and to scoring wings Dejan Bodiroga and Nikos Galis.

**STREETBALL LEGENDS:** Similar to Oscar Schmidt, **Earl Manigault** has become a popular player to suggest but who is overrated due to once being mentioned by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who was a teenager in NYC during the peak of Manigault's streetball fame in NYC. He was a 6-ft-1 SG who Kareem admitted couldn't/wouldn't pass, best known for his mythical leaping ability. He averaged 31 ppg and 13 rpg as a HS senior in a tiny town in North Carolina (*same HS as Sam Jones, Charlie Scott, Jimmy Walker, etc.*), then went to a D2 school for a semester but never played. I feel a lot more comfortable seriously considering **Joe ""The Destroyer"" Hammond**. Also a NYC streetball/Rucker legend, Hammond was named by the NY Times as the best streetball player ever ([link](https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/11/sports/basketball-legend-of-the-playground.html)) --and by [Complex](https://www.complex.com/sports/2013/07/greatest-streetball-players-of-all-time/joe-hammond)-- and he once famously scored 50 points against Dr. J in the 1970 Rucker League Championship game, all in the second half, winning the game and MVP honors. Hammond was 6-ft-4, so his size as an NBA SG makes more sense, and he set the Rucker League scoring record with 74 points in a game back in its hey day ([link](https://qns.com/story/2015/08/15/quiet-hoops-star-ross-making-noise-with-record-performances/#:~:text=He%20scored%2082%20points%20June,dropped%2058.)). Unfortunately he dropped out of HS in 9th grade and was heavily wrapped up in the world of drugs and hustling, so it's very difficult to know how his game would fit into the structured world of the NBA. It’s note-worthy that Hammond’s ridiculous scoring ability is mentioned a lot, whereas with Manigault it’s always his leaping that comes up first. I feel compelled to add that Pee Wee Kirkland, Hook Mitchell, Herman Knowings, and Booger Smith all have more than enough question marks or obvious deficiencies for me to not consider putting them in Hammond's class in this category. 

**EARLY PLAYERS (40's/50's):** Let's start with **Bob Kurland**, who was a better center than George Mikan but who went on to win several AAU titles while working a non-NBA job when the league was in its infancy (*[some context](https://old.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/hay4il/june_18_1924_george_mikan_was_born_mr_basketball/)*), but we're still talking about an unathletic center back when the game was built for those guys. I'd say a better big man to mention is **Sherman White**, a 6-ft-8 F/C who was the college POTY in '51 and who was the first big man to have athleticism and to display guard-like skills, but who never saw the NBA due to the rampant college point-shaving scandal of the time ([post with info](https://old.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/fq14rk/3_potential_alltime_greats_lost_to_college/)). I'd venture he could have been a top-5 talent of the 50's. An even more intriguing talent who never played in the NBA was **Marques Haynes**, the only Globetrotter in the HOF (*he was the PG on the Trotters when they beat Mikan’s championship Lakers multiple times in the late-40’s*). He is still arguably the best ball-handler of all-time, and originally couldn't play in the NBA because he was black, but in 1953 was offered the 2nd-largest contract in the league to join, but he turned it down to form his own barnstorming team. He was a better ball handler, shooter, and athlete than Bob Cousy, so he really could have been something special ([post with info](https://old.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/fs2clv/5_of_the_top_black_players_of_the_50searly60s_who/)). 

**DIED TOO SOON:** The obvious one here is **Len Bias**, but as I explained [in the comments of this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/habdzj/june_17_1986_the_1986_draft_best_well_known_for_2/), he was basically a highlight maker like Dominique Wilkins, but with less passing, rebounding, ball handling, and defense, plus his Maryland teams underperformed big time. **Hank Gathers** was an athletic & talented F who lead the national in scoring & rebounding at LMU in '89 who would have been a high lottery pick, but it's tough to project him as an all-time great for a few reasons I won't get into here (*it's been discussed online*). I'm most curious about the potential of **Benji Wilson** who was murdered right before his HS senior season began in 1984. He was the #1 recruit in his class (*over Pervis Ellison, Sean Elliott, and Danny Ferry*), a 6-ft-8 do-it-all G/F for ballyhooed Simeon HS in Chicago, described by his coach as ""Magic Johnson with a jump shot.""",nbadiscussion
1097,102,Scarily Eerie Similarities between 2013 Warriors and 2020 Mavs,"Most of this is probably just coincidence, but it's actually really interesting to think about how similar the 2020 Mavs are doing compared to the 2013 Warriors. 

2013: Warriors vs. Spurs Semi-Finals
2020: Mavs vs. Clippers First Round

A young team (2013 Warriors, 2020 Mavs) is in the playoffs for the first time in years, and they are the likable underdogs. Both teams feature a rising superstar in their playoff debut (Curry, Doncic), in which they face off against a veteran team (Spurs, Clippers) that stars defensive monster Kawhi Leonard.

Game 1: The young team surprises everyone by getting an early lead and maintaining the lead most of the way. The team's best player (Curry, Doncic) has one of the best games of his career, but they lose Game 1 because their second best player is forced to leave the game in the 2nd half (2013 Klay fouled out, 2020 Porzingis ejected).

Game 2: The team's second best player (Klay, Porzingis) returns, and their teams win Game 2 rather comfortably on the road, evening the series at 1-1.

Game 3: The higher seeded team (Spurs, Clippers) wins Game 3 without much difficulty. The team's best player (Curry, Doncic) injures his left ankle, scaring the fans. Kawhi has a strong performance.

Game 4: Despite injuring his left ankle, the team's star (Curry, Doncic) returns to play in Game 4. The higher seeded team (Spurs, Clippers) takes the lead early, but the game eventually goes to overtime. The underdogs (Warriors, Mavs) come back and win in a thriller on ABC.

Game 5: Blowout by the higher-seeded team (Spurs, Clippers). First blowout in this series.

Game 6: ?


Again, this doesn't at all imply that the NBA is rigged, but it's crazy to think about how similarly these two series are going. Does this mean that the Mavs will lose Game 6? Will the Clippers sweep Mike Conley in the next round but lose the following round in 7 to Lebron James and the eventual champs, just like the Spurs did in 2013? And then two years later, will the Mavs become a dynasty? 👀",nbadiscussion
1098,103,Who’s a player who stats don’t do justice for?,"For me, I always say Steve Nash. 

Revisionist history is starting the narrative that Nash “stole” two of Kobe’s MVPs, which doesn’t hold much weight. They see Nash never averaged more than 18 points per game, but his impact goes far beyond the stat sheet. He changed the way the point guard played, shooting the lights out and was an unbelievable passer. 

The fast pace offense was electric and they rose to be one of the best teams in the West. Unfortunately, stats just don’t do him justice, people act like he was basically John Stockton without the longevity, but in my book he’s just a hair behind Steph Curry in the best point guards ever conversation.",nbadiscussion
1099,104,"r/nbadiscussion is about to reach 50,000 subscribers. thank you all for making this become such a great place to talk basketball.","these playoffs this sub really started to spread it's wings. it's the first time we've had post-game threads for each game. and they were awesome threads. the addition of the schedule in the sidebar was a game changer for me, this sub became my playoff hub.

all of these awesome things are user created (and the users who create them often become mods!). if you have ideas for things we should do in the offseason, please feel free to try them. you can ask us in modmail, post here or make a thread asking the community -- or you can just do it. want to run a series of submissions asking people to analyze draft picks? please do it. you don't need permission. this is your sub, we just enforce our few rules.

thanks again everyone. it's been very gratifying watching this community blossom. i hope it continues to do so for many years to come.

i'd also like to thank r/nba. without them allowing users to spread the word about this sub, none of this would be possible. it's for this reason we don't condone or allow people trashing their sub here. we sincerely appreciate them allowing this sub to happen. for us, the subs complement each other very well. that is and will probably always be the best place on the internet for highlights, breaking news etc and people can come here for more in-depth discussion.",nbadiscussion
1100,105,How Big was the Porzingis ejection and is it something league should look at.,"Last night Dallas was winning 71-66 in the third quarter. At which point Morris and Luka got into it, Porzingis who was the closest Mav got between them and clearly shoved Morris away. After review refs gave a double T to Morris and Porzingis, this was Porzingis second T (first was for arguing when he got called for a foul on a clean block).

According to ESPN win probably the Mavs at this point had a 70% probability to win the game. However they wound up losing.

Obviously there’s no way to tell if the Mavs win with Porzingis most would agree that the Clips are the more talented team and maybe they still pull it off, however now we are robbed of knowing because of the ejection.

Obviously Techs are a necessary thing in the game, However if anyone was watching I think it’s clear to say that both were very boarder-line Ts, specially the first, a guy like Draymond does what Porzingis did there 3 times a game every game basically.

Should the league at some point consider what constitutes a tech? Should there be more leniency for a guy who is gonna get ejected for a minor offense? What about as yesterday when the first Technical was very much a reach AND after the ref made a clear mistake?",nbadiscussion
1101,106,Who Drafted The Best This Decade Given Their Draft Capital?,"I've been seeing a lot of people ranking which teams drafted the best this decade on r/NBA, YouTube, etc. and the teams at the top are generally always the Celtics, Bucks, Jazz, Nuggets, etc. It's easy to see why this is the case as well. The Celtics drafted Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum 3rd overall, and despite being considered slight reaches at the time, they have both shown they have been well worth the pick. The other three that I mentioned got great value later in the draft including Giannis for the Bucks, Mitchell and Gobert for the Jazz, and Jokic for the Nuggets. And most importantly, these teams put themselves in excellent positions to succeed at the moment and in the future, which goes to show the impact of their draft hauls this decade. However, focusing on the treasure chests they've unearthed makes it easy to forget about their big misses, and each of them has such misses. The Bucks drafted Jabari Parker at #2 overall and Thon Maker at #10 overall, the Nuggets drafted Emmanuel Mudiay #7 overall, the Jazz drafted Trey Burke at #9 and Dante Exum at #5, and finally the Celtics drafted Guershon Yabusele and James Young at 16 and 17 respectively (this one isn't nearly as bad). So while these teams have been excellent at building through the draft, one could say given their draft capital, they should have built *even better* teams.

I decided to examine the drafts by looking at how much value the teams got based on the draft capital they've acquired. I had a couple different ideas for how to go about doing this. Essentially, I wanted to grade each draft pick based on some expected value for that pick based on the strength of the draft class and the historical value of the draft position. First, I decided to determine each player's relative VORP (Value Over Replacement Player), which I did by finding each player's VORP percentile for their draft class and comparing it to the average VORP percentile for that position from the years 1989-2018. So if player X was drafted nth overall, I first determined that player X was in the p\_x percentile for VORP in their draft class, and on average players selected nth overall were in the p\_n percentile for VORP for their respective draft classes, so player X has a relative VORP percentile of (p\_x - p\_n). I then averaged the relative VORP percentiles of each team's draft picks from 2010-2018 (I decided these statistics would not be very useful for the 2019 draft classes since they did not play even a full season yet) and ranked them. The results are in the table below (the numbers next to the players represent how much they exceeded the expected percentile by for example, historically, 20th overall picks are in the 21st percentile for VORP, but Delon Wright is in the 90th percentile for VORP in 2015 so he has a relative VORP percentile of +68.11)

**Note:** I consider a player to be drafted by a team if the team acquires the rights to that player by the end of that player's draft night. 

This method has some merits, but also some very clear flaws. The most obvious flaw is how much it overrates second round picks. This is in large part due to second round picks having a low expected VORP percentile so reaching the median VORP (which is around 0) automatically puts these players in ""steal"" territory. With the way VORP is calculated, a lot of these ""second round steals"" barely played, but since they had VORPs near 0 (and were not given opportunity to let it drop further) they were overrated. 

I tried a different approach after this in which I used win shares instead. Win Shares are additive, so it makes sense to make arguments such as adding up players X, Y, and Z's win shares and saying since X contributes to 50% of the total win shares, he is the best player. I attempted to expand upon this logic using the same general idea as before where I tried to grade players based on the draft class and position. I ended up determining the percentage of the total draft class's win shares contributed by each player and subtracting from that the expected percentage of the draft class's win shares for that position to determine the adjusted win share rate of each draft pick. And just like I did earlier, I averaged each team's picks from 2010 to 2018, and the results are below.

Now I am trying to avoid confirmation bias, but this list looks a lot more as expected, right? We can see Giannis, Kawhi, Luka, KAT, Siakam, Donovan Mitchell and other names we associate with draft ""steals"" in this one and a lot fewer obscure second round picks as well. That being said, there are certainly flaws to this approach as well. The primary being the biases exhibited by the win shares statistic itself. Now no statistic is perfect, and for the record I think win shares is pretty close to perfect, but it seems to favor centers with a lot of rebounds and high field goal percentage as a result of higher percentage shots attempted. We can see this shown when Greg Monroe is considered the second best pick by the Pistons this decade when he was picked 7th in a pretty loaded 2010 draft and Spencer Dinwiddie was also chosen by them and he would generally be considered a more valuable pick than Monroe as a second rounder. Now these kinds of rim running centers are generally highly regarded by a lot of advanced statistics, but I feel that win shares maybe slightly overrates them. 

The question in the title has still not been answered, so I will try to use the results above, and a little bit of my own opinion, to present my rankings for the best drafting team of 2010-2018. Now it is important to note exactly the question I am answering. I am not answering which team got the most value out of their draft picks because I feel that this has a lot to do with coaching and developing. I am ranking the teams by which team's picks were most likely to outperform their draft position. For example, I am not saying that the Detroit Pistons are among the best drafting organizations in the league because they are ranked high in large part due to players they had no role in developing such as Middleton and Dinwiddie. I am saying that the Detroit Pistons have been among the best in the league in likelihood that their draft pick outperforms their position.

So without further ado, here are my rankings.

&#x200B;

|1|Toronto Raptors|
|:-|:-|
|2|San Antonio Spurs|
|3|Denver Nuggets|
|4|Houston Rockets|
|5|Indiana Pacers|
|6|Miami Heat|
|7|Detroit Pistons|
|8|Brooklyn Nets|
|9|Golden State Warriors|
|10|Chicago Bulls|
|11|Milwaukee Bucks|
|12|Utah Jazz|
|13|Los Angeles Lakers|
|14|Boston Celtics|
|15|Atlanta Hawks|
|16|Portland Trail Blazers|
|17|Philadelphia 76ers|
|18|New York Knicks|
|19|New Orleans Pelicans|
|20|Los Angeles Clippers|
|21|Oklahoma City Thunder|
|22|Dallas Mavericks|
|23|Minnesota Timberwolves|
|24|Orlando Magic|
|25|Charlotte Hornets|
|26|Washington Wizards|
|27|Memphis Grizzlies|
|28|Sacramento Kings|
|29|Phoenix Suns|
|30|Cleveland Cavaliers|

So there you have it folks. I would love any sort of constructive criticism especially on my quantitative analysis portion. Are there any other statistics I should use, or better yet, a combination of statistics that tell a better story? Is one method better than the other in any way?

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

Raptors and Spurs have been insane at drafting and maximizing low value picks

Rockets, Pacers, Pistons, and Nets have been surprisingly good at finding value

Please do not let the Cavs or Suns near a top pick because they don't seem like they know what to do with them.",nbadiscussion

1103,108,The play that the Utah Jazz killed the Nuggets with.,"In yesterday’s game, the Jazz kept running a side pick and roll and scoring seemingly at will with it. Webber commented on it repeatedly, implying  that Mitchell’s skill level enabled them to have success on a predictable play.

Why was the side pick and roll so effective against the nuggets? What coaching adjustment would have helped counter it? 

I’ve seen a post about Jokic dropping on most coverage, and i know the Nuggets have been getting scorched by the Jazz guards in this series. I’m just trying to understand how that all plays into the side pick and roll the Jazz were executing to perfection.",nbadiscussion
1104,109,Kyrie Irving is proving his doubters right.,"Just a couple days ago, I made a post about some of my favorite players, and Kyrie was on that list. I specifically talked about how a lot of people don’t like him as a player because of his leadership skills. I stated how not everyone is meant to be a leader, so I don’t think that can really be held against how talented he is.  However, after watching his post game comments from last night I definitely feel like he proved all his naysayers correct. I was wrong. He basically said that the Nets (with him AND KD) are still some “pieces” away from a championship. According to him, this fact is “glaring”. 

I’ve always been on Team Kyrie. I was happy when he left Cleveland because I could see how being looked at as LeBron’s sidekick can be overwhelming. I thought he was going to lead Boston to success and that he was getting too much blame last season. Brooklyn doesn’t look bad at all, but I’ve said since the end of last year that they just need a 4 star player to get them to the next level. Kyrie is supposed to be that. Or at least that’s what I would expect if I signed him to a max contract. He is a really talented player, but I really wish he would use that talent effectively.

Edit because I should have specified this: I personally heard the whole comment. I summarized, but I am still using the full context. The team without KD and Kyrie is pretty decent. I just want to know why  (according to Kyrie) there is still a “glaring” need for more pieces. Aren’t max contract players supposed to make up for this? That’s why they get paid so much in comparison to other players?",nbadiscussion

1106,111,What DeMar DeRozan lacks is exactly what teams are looking for in their role players in the current landscape of the league.,"This is obvious if you think about it, but DeMar’s only significant weaknesses as a player are his inability to attempt and hit the 3 consistently and his mediocre defence. So basically he’s lacking in 3-D, which is the make of an average role player around the league. DeMar is either elite or pretty good in every other aspect of the game, think about it.

- Very good playmaker
- Elite midrange shooter
- Good finisher around the rim/great dunker
- One of the best in the league at drawing fouls
- Very athletic
- Good size
- Good leader (lead Toronto to 5 consecutive winning seasons, albeit poor playoff runs)

If he could even develop an average 3 point shot and up his defence a tiny bit, he’d be one of the most well rounded players in the league and arguably top 10. Again, this is pretty obvious and isn’t ground breaking analysis.",nbadiscussion
1107,112,"15 years ago today, the infamous 'Malice at the Palace' happened","On 19th November 2004, the game between Pacers-Pistons ended up a brawl.

That incident became known as 'Malice at the Palace'.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQIIOWPNYM0

Here is more information about it from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacers%E2%80%93Pistons_brawl)...

>The Pacers–Pistons brawl, colloquially known as the Malice at the Palace and the Basketbrawl, was an altercation that occurred in a National Basketball Association (NBA) game between the Indiana Pacers and the then-defending champion Detroit Pistons on November 19, 2004, at The Palace of Auburn Hills in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The Associated Press (AP) called it ""the most infamous brawl in NBA history.""

>With 45.9 seconds left in the game, Pistons center Ben Wallace went up for a layup, but was fouled by Pacers small forward Ron Artest. Furious at being fouled when the game had already been decided, Wallace pushed Artest, and a fight broke out on the court between several players. After the fight was broken up, a fan threw a drink from the stands at Artest while he was lying on the scorer's table. Artest immediately charged after the fan, but ended up attacking the wrong fan. This led to a massive brawl between players and spectators that stretched from the seats down to the court and lasted several minutes.

>After the game, the NBA suspended nine players for a total of 146 games, leading to the players losing $11 million in salary. Five players were charged with assault, and eventually sentenced to a year of probation and community service. Five fans also faced criminal charges and were banned from attending Pistons home games for life. The fight also led the NBA to increase security between players and fans and limit the sale of alcohol in games.",nbadiscussion
1108,113,Kawhi Leonard just finished the game with a career high in turnovers. The Clippers lack of playmaking was very apparent.,"Kawhi Leonard had 9 turnovers in the game against the Raptors. This beat his previous career high which was 8 in the 18-19 season. He only has a career average of 2.4 assists per game, and currently he is averaging 3 turnovers for every 5 assists. 

Paul George isn’t particularly a playmaker either. His career average is 3.3 assists. He only averaged 4.1 assists last season while averaging 2.7 turnovers.

People typically go on to say Lou Williams is the Clippers best playmaker. Yes, he is, but he’s averaging 5.8 this season. Yeah, he’s their best playmaker, but you need a point guard who can efficiently dish out assists and get 7-8 a night.

All the teams we consider “contenders” all have outstanding playmakers on their teams. Lakers have LeBron. Houston has Harden and Westbrook. Bucks have Giannis. Philly has Simmons. Even Toronto who has Van Vleet (who is quietly averaging 7.7 assists per game, Top 10 in the league).

The Clippers biggest weekness is their lack of passing and playmaking and it showed tonight. They pulled it out in the end, but against teams that everyone floats around as “contenders” will be able to close out those games in the future.",nbadiscussion
1109,114,"If Toronto wins a title this year, how does that change Kawhi’s legacy?","The Raptors will likely finish as the 2 seed in the East, and while the Bucks are clearly the favorite to go to the Finals, it’s not crazy to think Toronto makes it instead. From there anything is possible in the bubble. We’ve already seen Lou Williams having to miss two weeks because he went to a strip club, and *if* the Raptors at full strength, I wouldn’t be surprised if they upset a team out of the West. 

I know a lot has to happen, but the Raptors winning a title is a legit possibility. With that said, what does Kawhi’s legacy look like if they do win? As of now, he’s a guy that win a title in his first season with a franchise that notoriously came up short in the playoffs. If they win a ring the year after he leaves, that outlook could definitely change.

Giannis Antetokoumpo (29.6 ppg , 43.8 pp100) has actually scored slightly more points per 100 possessions this season than James Harden (34.4 ppg , 43.5 pp100) this season. Trivia: last season's Harden (36.1 ppg, 48.2 pp100) set the highest scoring rate in NBA history. 

---

**LABron**

Despite LeBron and Anthony Davis having a similar usage and scoring rate, the Lakers net rating *improves* by +10.8 points when LeBron is on the floor, but *drops* by 2.7 when AD is playing. This aberration is likely because Dwight and McGee were more than capable of beating up on weaker bench units when AD left for the bench (similar to how even MVP-candidate Harden had slightly underwhelming on/off figures because those CP-led bench units roasted teams while he was sitting). Moving LeBron to the bench, however, is a disaster, because the Lakers' next most reliable playmaker is Rajon Rondo, who has a glorious on/off split of -8.3. LeBron lifts a heavier load for this team than is immediately apparent to the eye.

Hassan Whiteside leads the league with 3.1 blocks per game. Despite this, the Blazers are 27th in defensive rating. 

---

**Offensive juggernauts**

The 2019-20 Dallas Mavericks set the highest raw single-season offensive rating in NBA history: 116.7. The gap between them and the 2nd-place Houston Rockets (113.8) is similar to the gap between the Rockets and the 15th-place Pelicans (110.8). They're ***6.3*** points better than the league average offense. [538 did an excellent piece on them](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/luka-doncic-and-the-mavs-are-pushing-the-limits-of-offensive-efficiency/).

---

**Literally one of the best defenses ever**

The 2019-20 Milwaukee Bucks have been similarly destructive on *defense*, if not even more so. They're in a class of their own, a whopping ***3.3*** points better defensively than the excellent 2nd-ranked Raptors. They're also a ridiculous ***8.5 points better*** than the league average defense, which makes them [one of the best defenses (relative to league average) *ever*](https://old.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/g2w1i7/the_201920_bucks_have_been_one_of_the_best/). And, yes, you guessed it, [538 have done an excellent piece on them as well](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/few-teams-have-ever-defended-like-these-milwaukee-bucks/).

**Best friends do everything together!**

Russell Westbrook leads the league in 2 point field goal attempts, and his good friend and teammate James Harden leads the league in 3 point field goal attempts.

---

**""Everything revolves around me""**

It probably began with Westbrook's historic MVP season or one of those Cleveland LeBron years, but we are now officially well and truly in the era of **heliocentric superstars**: 
 in the 2019-20 season, there are **6 players with usage rates over 34%** - Giannis, Luka, Harden, Trae, Beal, and Westbrook. (Heck, Harden and Westbrook *play for the same team*. Bonkers.) In the 2015-16 season, there was only 1 player **total** with a usage rate above 34% - DeMarcus Cousins, with 35.4 %. More players have begun adopting the Harden/WB/LeBron do-absolutely-everything-for-your-offense approach this season, and *very very soon* it could be the norm, rather than the exception.

**Prayer Circle for Khash Money**

Khris Middleton is *painfully, achingly* close to a 50/40/90 season, with .499/.418/.908 splits. We can only pray he achieves the distinction once the season resumes.

---

**Dame D.O.L.L.A.**

For the 1st time in 4 years, James Harden isn't leading the league in offensive win-shares: that award goes to Damian Lillard, who edges out Harden while trying to drag the skeleton Blazers kicking and screaming into the playoffs, putting up 8.9 win-shares as a result (to Harden's 8.7).

---

**Taking it to the rack**

Devin Booker (72.3%) and Luka Doncic (75.4%) have had *phenomenal* paint-finishing seasons. Booker's finishing at the rim for a guard has been fantastic, and Luka has been putting up efficiency in the paint comparable to historically elite finishers like Anthony Davis (75.3%) and Giannis (76.7%). Of course, those guys *take* more shots in the paint than these two, but the efficiency is still highly remarkable.

---

**Making history I**

LeBron James is primed to be the 6th player in NBA history with both a scoring title and assist title to their name (the others being Tiny Archibald, Jerry West, Oscar Robertson, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden). Speaking of Harden, he is primed to be the 9th player in NBA history to win 3 scoring titles. Giannis is primed to be the 14th player in NBA history to win 2 MVPs.

---

**Making history II**

Giannis Antetokounmpo's 31.71 PER this season is set to be the 5th highest mark in NBA history, only behind MJ, LeBron, and 2 Wilt seasons, and by the tiniest of margins (Wilt's no. 1 ranked PER ever was around 31.8).

---

**Making history III**

This will likely be LeBron's 13th All-NBA 1st-team, the highest ever, ahead of Kobe and Karl Malone with 11. This will also put LeBron at 16 total All-NBA selections, breaking a 4-way tie between him, Kareem, Kobe, and Duncan, and vaulting him into clear 1st place.

---

**Sophomore savant**

Luka Dončić has just had one of the best age-20 seasons in NBA history (29/9/9 on 58ts%). Per 100 possessions, that's 41.7/13.5/12.7 on +2.0 rTS%, PER of 27.7, 0.215 WS/48, 8.4 BPM, leading the best offense in the league (with the 13th best record, 7th in West, 5th best SRS). A comparable age-20 season, perhaps, was LeBron's, who put up 34.4/9.3/9.1 per 100 possessions on +2.5 rTS%, 25.7 PER, 0.203 WS/48, 8.6 BPM, though his Cavs that year *just* missed out on the playoffs (15th best record).

**Chasing Steph**

Now, nearly 5 years after one man weaponised the 3 point shot like no other, how far are the rest of the league from catching Steph's ridiculous 2015-16 record of **402** threes made in a single season? **That season, he played 80 games, made 5.1 threes per game, attempted 11.2 threes per game, and shot 45.5 3P%.** 

The most productive high-volume shooters this season (>3.5 3PM/game) have been: **Harden** (4.4 3PM/game, 12.6 3PA, 35.2 3P%), **Lillard** (3.9 3PM, 9.9 3PA, 39.4 3P%), **Buddy Hield** (3.8 3PM, 9.7 3PA, 39.5 3P%), **Duncan Robinson** (3.7 3PM, 8.4 3PA, 44.8 3P%), and **Davis Bertans** (3.7 3PM, 8.7 3PA, 42.4 3P%). 

As I'm sure you've all realised by now, it's *extremely* difficult to maintain such an obscenely good 3P% (45.5%, wtf) while shooting over 11 3s a game. Even extremely good shooters like Hield and Bertans have found that pushing the upper limit of attempts has limited their efficiency somewhat (down from 44-45%), and neither of them have even cracked double-digit 3P attempts. The solution to this, other than pulling a Steph, seems to be simply *taking* more 3s. Other than the pure shooters (Hield, Bertans, Robinson), the only players with the combination of **usage**, 3p-shooting prowess, 3p-attempting likelihood, and durability to break Steph's record, seem to be Harden, Lillard, Trae, Luka, and maybe D'Angelo Russell, Devonte' Graham, or KAT.

- - **Zach Lavine masterclass**: Lavine's Nov 23 performance against the Hornets was one for the ages. On the surface, the 49 points and 13 3-pointers (2nd most of all time) are impressive enough, but context makes it even more special: the Bulls were **trailing by 8 with 45 seconds remaining**, with the game basically out of reach, before Lavine hit three of his 3s, including [this completely ridiculous relocation-to-the-wing-three off an inbounds-steal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW74Oj2G8H4) as a completely improbable game-winner to cap off an incredible night.

1113,118,"[OC] Where teams shoot from, relative to league average","tl;dr: [This chart shows how often each team shoots from the various parts of the court relative to league average. Darker areas indicate a higher amount of attempts from the corresponding area relative to the rest of the league.](https://imgur.com/y8pxB59)

***

At a time when it seems like [every team plays the same way](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/f1qs6t/oc_the_unbearable_sameness_of_moreyball_25_most/), it can be illuminating to see what makes them different. 

[In this chart](https://imgur.com/y8pxB59), I show how often each team shoots from the different parts of the court, relative to league average. Darker areas on the court indicate a higher amount of volume from the corresponding area compared to the rest of the league. 

For example, take a look at the patch of dark red +30 feet from the hoop on the Atlanta Hawks chart. That means the Hawks (read: Trae Young) take more shots from that part of the court than any other team. 

Meanwhile, the Spurs have a blanket of black in the mid-range. Accordingly, they take more mid-range shots per game than anyone else (the next closest is Indiana).  

Note that blank areas show where a team shoots at or below league average volume. For example, the Houston Rockets and Brooklyn Nets have almost no color in the mid-range because they take at or less than the league average number of attempts from that part of the court. A team like the Celtics takes roughly a league average number of attempts from almost all parts of the court, which is why their whole chart is mostly blank. 

*** 

**Methodology:**

I charted every shot taken this season and binned them into similarly sized hexagons. I then found out the league average number of attempts from each hexagon and calculated how many standard deviations away from the mean each team was from each hexagon. The darker the color on the chart, the higher the deviation. A team taking a league-average number of attempts from each location would have a blank chart. 

This post is inspired by the work of /u/sportsanalyticsguy, who performed a [similar analysis last season](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/b5fllk/where_each_nba_team_gets_their_buckets_relative/)

The best example I can think of is CP3 this year who people thought was the worst contract in the league and is now leading a team to a 5th seed in the west.",nbadiscussion
1115,120,"CP3 has been fantastic this season, but people are criminally underrating the huge improvements of the rest of the Thunder roster and Billy Donovan.","##CP3

First off, he’s had a fantastic season. This post isn’t meant to hate on him. He’s been crazy efficient all year. His raw counting stats don’t tell the full story as his leadership provides so much to a Thunder team that was supposed to rebuild this year. He’s also been one of the best players in the clutch this season. While his defense has taken a step back from his perennial all-defense days, he’s still solid on that end as well.

But a surprising amount of people attribute all of OKC’s success this year to him alone, as if he’s more impactful than Russ and PG combined. In reality, there’s many factors that contribute to OKC’s success in 2020. 

##Schroder

Dennis Schroder has improved so much this year. He went from an above average bench PG to top 3 6MOY candidate. Donovan is using him differently on offense (more on that later) and on defense he’s improved a lot, hounding ball handlers as they come up the court and pressing them hard.  But similar to CP3, stats don’t tell the full story. The more telling story is his crazy impact on his teams performance. Here’s a look at how Paul and the Thunder perform with CP3 and Schroder vs with CP3 alone. 

CP3 without Schroder: 24.0 PTS, 10.6 AST, 3.7 TO, 9.0 FTA, 111.6 ORTG, 111.8 DRTG, -0.3 NETRTG, 1.7 AST/TO, 54.5% eFG%, 58.4% TS, 98.72 Pace

CP3 w/ Schroder: 30.9 PTS, 10.2 AST, 3.4 TO, 3.7 FTA, 114.9 ORTG, 99.4 DRTG, +15.6 NETRTG, 1.78 AST/TO, 55.5% eFG, 60.9% TS, 104.48 Pace

[Source for per 100 stats](https://www.pbpstats.com/on-off/nba/player?Season=2019-20&SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&TeamId=1610612760&PlayerId=203471), everything else is from NBA.com. 

He’s also shooting incredibly well this year, going from 34% 3PT to 39% 3PT. Last year teams would always go under the screen when he ran PnR and he provided very little actual spacing for his team.

I strongly believe he deserves 6MOY this year over Lou Will or Harrell

##Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 

Shai has shown out as well - he continued to grow and in his second year went from 11/3/3 to 19/6/3 while improving his efficiency and further improving his defense. His size and versatility are a huge plus for this Thunder team, as his ability to effectively guard wings allows the Thunder to run their 3 guard lineups. Things like that showcase how well their roster fits together and suits Donovan’s schemes better than last years roster. 

##Spacing

The Thunder’s spacing has improved so much this year. If you look at raw 3PT% and don’t watch the games it doesn’t look too bad - they’re shooting roughly the same (went from 34.8% to 35.5%) but actually watching them they’re a completely different animal. Yes, Ferguson and Grant shot pretty good from 3 last year but teams frequently sagged off of them and ignored them at times. Russ would drive into a crowded paint and STILL get those shooters open. With CP3/Schroder/Shai/Gallo they have so much more space to work on offense. 

Even when it came to converting those open looks they were horribly inconsistent. Everyone on that 18-19 Thunder team had random super hot and cold streaks. Unfortunately they all went ice cold right around the playoffs. They were cold as a team going in, PG and Russ were injured, and Ferg/Grant were ice cold outside of Game 3 where Grant shot 5/5. Spacing was a huge issue and that roster was extremely poorly constructed outside of Russ and PG

##Danilo Gallinari

Gallinari has been a fantastic spacer and offensive threat for the Thunder this year. He is shooting a whopping **41%** from 3 this year, top 20 in the league.

He’s always been fantastic on offense but his health has struggled massively as he’s dealt with a ton of injuries in the past. From 2010-18 he started only 335 of a possible 656 games. This year however, he’s been fantastic and has had no injury issues. This brings me to my next point...

##Impressive Health and Lack of Injuries

People love to clown on the preseason predictions for the Thunder now, but coming into this season it wasn’t just underrating that roster. Many expected CP3/Gallo/Adams to be traded. One huge point was that all of those players were very injury prone coming into this year as well. 

CP3 played EVERY SINGLE GAME for the Thunder this year after missing nearly a third of last season. His injury the year before cost the Rockets a chip. Gallinari, despite his aforementioned injury issues, only missed 8 games this season. 

They have Roberson coming back for the playoffs and he’s looked great so far in his limited time back. He’s one of the best defenders in the league but missed both playoff runs with Russ and PG. 

##Billy Donovan

Donovan is coaching far better this year than years past. Back when they had Russ, PG, KD, etc. I always felt like those teams could have used more of a “player’s coach” than Donovan. He’s always been great at developing young players but he’s not the coach I’d want to coach those sorts of teams. His coaching acumen was wasted as he wasn’t the right style of coach that those rosters needed. 

Russ and PG almost never ran set plays. they were successful mainly due to how crazy talented they were. so they weren’t elevated at all by donovan who is a great player development and X’s and o’s coach. Meanwhile, CP3 and these young guys aren’t as talented but their on court play is elevated a lot because of how well they fit together as a system.

They didn’t straight up lose Russ and PG, they traded them and got multiple good players in exchange. That sort of personnel is always going to be a better fit for a coach like Donovan, as opposed to a more heliocentric roster.

The Thunder are not playing better this season because Russ and PG left. they’re better in large part because Donovan is able to run his sets and plays more often with this personnel that’s far better suited for his specific scheme. he may not be inventing new plays but his coaching this year is def different more hands on compared to earlier.

From an X’s and O’s perspective they’re doing different things this year. for example their 3 PG lineups. it worked horribly last year in spurts with Schroder and Felton but this year he has a rising star in Shai who can make that work. among other things. Their personnel this year better fits what scheme he wants to run. 

They went from just giving the ball to Russ and PG and letting them carry the offense to actually running a structured offense. This year they run 2-3 guards running dribble handoffs and other actions on the perimeter, looking for a mismatch they can exploit. 

**Overall, the Thunder have played better this year than in years past. While CP3 plays a huge role in that, he is getting all of the credit for their progress when in reality it is due to a multitude of factors. I hope people have a greater appreciation for the entire OKC squad after reading this.**",nbadiscussion
1116,121,"Ben Simmons is the most promising player in Philly, but he's the one who's holding them back","Ben Simmons has staked himself in the league this season as one of the most gifted defenders in basketball. The versatility that he possesses, where he is able to switch onto five positions regularly, is the most valuable aspect of his game. His bag of lateral quickness, strength, speed, and size makes him a premier threat on defense. He is also very astute at being able to disrupt offenses, and use his acceleration and vision to turn quick steals into easy buckets. He is currently leading the league in takeaways at 2.1, third in steal percentage, second in the league in deflections, and third in the league in loose balls recovered. This accompanies a 105 DRtg, 3.2 DWS, and a 2.4 DBPM which all land Simmons top 20 league-wide. While Defensive Player of the Year may be a long shot considering his stiff competition of Rudy Gobert and Giannis Antetokounmpo; he still shows promise to one day be the best defender in the league, if he's not already there.

But, there are two sides to every coin, and there are two sides to every basketball court. On offense, Ben Simmons has perfected the art of being a pylon on the perimeter. During many offensive sets, Simmons will simply throw the ball into the post to Embiid and just stand there watching. This is not to downplay him as a playmaker, an area he is elite in; rather, it is a criticism of his shooting or lack thereof. 

Philadelphia does not need defense, proven by Philadephia's exorbitant corps of defenders: Al Horford, Matisse Thybulle, Joel Embiid, and Josh Richardson on the outside looking in. What the 76ers need is perimeter shooting. 

Let me tell you a story. In both 1994 and 2000, Shaq played in the NBA Finals. In 1994, he played for the Magic against the Houston Rockets and Hakeem Olajuwon. In 2000, he played for the Lakers and played the Reggie Miller lead Pacers. However, both teams that won the Finals in those seasons had one consistent attribute: an all-time dominant post player surrounded by good perimeter shooters. 

For the '94 Rockets, they had the aforementioned Olajuwon alongside Vernon Maxwell, Kenny Smith, Robert Horry, Sam Cassell, Mario Ellie, and Otis Thorpe. That roster construction culminated in Olajuwon having the second-best passing season of his career, only missing 1993's mark from 291 to 287. The gameplan was simple but effective: get the ball inside to Hakeem and let him get to work. And as you and I both know, Hakeem in the post is almost always a guaranteed bucket. So, the only way to combat this was to bring another player for the double, but that would leave either Otis Thorpe open for a cut to the basket, or Hakeem could throw it out to one of his knockdown shooters. A gameplan like this is even more dynamic against a young center such as Shaquille O'Neal, who was still developing defensively.

In regards to the 2000 Lakers, their roster consisted primarily of Shaq, Derek Fisher, Rick Fox, AC Green, Glen Rice, Kobe Bryant, Ron Harper, and none other than Robert Horry. Lead by Phil Jackson, the 2000 Lakers adopted almost an identical strategy to that of the '94 Rockets. But, opponents absolutely had to double Shaq in the post. If you didn't put two defenders on Hakeem he has a 95% chance of scoring, but if you don't double-team Shaq he has a 100% chance. And just as Hakeem had the best passing season of his career, so did Shaq with 299. 

So, why am I talking about the 1994 Rockets and the 2000 Lakers? That is because the 2020 76ers have a lot that they could learn from these teams. Joel Embiid is of similar kin to Shaquille O'Neal and Hakeem Olajuwon. While he is a far cry from being as great as the other two, he is without a doubt the most dominant post player in the league today. But that has not translated into offensive success, why is that? Well it's mainly because of who is playing alongside Embiid; the most common lineup this season for the 76ers was: 

PG: Ben Simmons

SG: Josh Richardson

SF: Tobias Harris

PF: Al Horford

C: Joel Embiid

That lineup is not sufficient enough to maintain long term success on the offensive side of the ball. Tobias Harris is the most constant shooting force being held back by his consistency, Josh Richardson has had a relatively paltry season compared to years past, Al Horford has become a non-factor on that side of the ball other than screens, rolling to the basket, and an occasional spot-up shot, and then you have Ben Simmons. In the five most effective lineups for the 76ers this season, Simmons is only in one of them. Lineups that supplement Shake Milton in place for Simmons and Korkmaz for Horford flourish because of the fluidity that is implemented as a result of their outside shooting. This is primarily because of the conflict that the 76ers have with Embiid and Simmons being on the same team. A gargantuan post presence like Embiid requires the attention of every defender around the painted area which results in Simmons not being able to drive and dish at the rate than he may want. A Russell Westbrook playstyle would greatly help him be able to flourish, but sharing the floor with non-shooters like Embiid and Horford makes that a very minute possibility. 

So, what is the one thing that could help this problem?

Ben Simmons needs to shoot the fuckin' ball.

Since 2015, only two players have averaged at least 11 FGA's per game with an under .015 3PAr in at least three seasons. They are Andre Drummond and Ben Simmons. When looking for players who vehemently avoid shooting threes like Simmons, you get names like Ayton, Drummond, Derrick Favors, and Greg Monroe. To find another guard or guard-forward player who has also done this, one must go all the way back to 1994, when Rod Strickland, Jeff Malone, and Doug West all did it. Ben Simmons is not just refusing to take threes, he is avoiding them at a historic pace to the point where one must go back 26 years to find a player who has done the same as him.

Philadelphia's offense this year has been stagnant, uncreative, and lifeless. This is not fully on Simmons, the 76ers as a whole underperformed. But that doesn't excuse his refusal to take a jump shot practically anywhere on the court.  A trade would not be a feasible idea because no one in their right mind would trade away a blossoming superstar who is already a defensive stalwart. The change needs to come from the inside.",nbadiscussion

Notes: 

1. I know I don't have a consistent logic when it comes to these rankings. I believe each player and their careers need to be examined individually and in context. Applying a universal logic to the rankings belittles each player's careers and individual stories. 
2. I believe peak Lebron was better at basketball than peak MJ but MJ gets the advantage because of his achievements. 
3. Not all rings are created equal. Dirk's 2011 ring>Durants 2 rings. Lebron's 2016 is treated the same way. Bird winning 3 as the clear No.1>Magic winning 5. The same is true with Kobe's rings with regards to Shaq. 
4. Bill Russell's achievements, despite a weak era, are too overwhelming to leave him out of the T5. ***I'm not a Celtics fan despite it seeming like it.*** 
5. Bird>Magic because he was better individually, worse supporting cast, and he would have been even better (maybe another title and MVP) had he not gotten hurt. 
6. Curry>Durant because of his impact on the game. Also, his rings have more ""value.""No finals MVP doesn't matter to me (should have won in 2015 anyways). 
7. Dirk>KG bc Dirk's ring holds more value than KG's. Dirk also has more impressive stats and longevity. 
8. Isaiah gets underrated by many. The only ""little guy"" outside of Curry to be the best player on a title team (multiple title teams actually). Also, he did this in a super competitive era (Bird Celts and Magic/Kareem Lakers).
9. Shaq>Duncan because of his far greater peak. Also, Duncan's longevity gets severely overrated. He was only MVP level for 5 years (2002-2007).",nbadiscussion

Hey everyone - in this 3min video analysis, I took a deeper look at Lakers’ wing Kyle Kuzma’s great perimeter defense vs the Clippers on 7/30/20 and the key elements and skills that unlocked it.

Here’s a table of contents, header (sub-headings):

For those at work or the hard of hearing, I've transcribed subtitles on YouTube so sound isn't required.

Summary: A key to the Lakers W over the Clippers in their restart opener was the individual defense of Kyle Kuzma who was primarily matched up with Kawhi and early on hunted in pick and roll (that changed late). In this video, I broke down four video clips on the key elements and skills that Kuz showed during the game. The first clip is vs Kawhi off a brush screen into a reverse pivot, the 2nd clip is when switched on Reggie Jackson, the third clip is when navigating screen options vs PG14, and lastly, a clip in crunch time vs Kawhi when Kuz dealt with a nasty inside-out dribble and right to left gather.

1120,125,Your Franchise's All-Time Team (No Teammates Allowed),"A twist on typical all-time teams:  what is the all-time team for your franchise if you can only choose players who were never teammates?  There can be no overlap in the years each player was with the your team. Also, this only counts the years each player actually played for  your team (example: no  prime Shaq on the Suns).

I'm a Suns fan, so here's mine to give you an idea:

**PHOENIX SUNS**

**PG:  Steve Nash (2004-05 - 2011-12)**  
*Stats:  14.4 ppg, 3.1 rpg, 9.4 apg, 50.4% fg, 43.5% 3fg*  
***Reasoning:***  Nash is the greatest Sun of all time, in my opinion. Back-to-back   MVP's, most fun team to watch, just an amazing time to be a Suns fan. He made all of his teammates better, so it would also be interesting to see how much better he could make the other guys on this team.

**SG:  Devin Booker (2015-16 - Present)**  
*Stats:  22.3 ppg, 3.6 rpg, 4.7 apg, 48.7% fg, 36.0% 3fg*  
***Reasoning:***  Yes, the defense in the back court would be really bad, but it would be incredible to see what Booker could do with Nash as his point guard. The scoring/shooting would be phenomenal between these two. Booker is also an easy choice because he hasn't played with any other Suns  greats.

**SF:  Connie Hawkins (1969-70 - 1973-74)**  
*Stats:  20.5 ppg, 9.0 rpg, 4.3 apg, 46.6% fg, n/a 3fg*  
***Reasoning:***  Hawkins only played on the Suns for four seasons so it's easy to fit him in here without any overlap, but he is also worthy of being on the all-time team. Hawkins was a dominant offensive force, was an incredible  rebounder, and a really good passer. Having Nash-Booker-Hawkins  together on the court would allow for some of the  best ball movement and  playmaking in the league. A slam-dunk champion  running alongside Nash would be extremely fun to watch and it's hard to  pass up an All-NBA First Team selection here.

**PF:  Charles Barkley (1992-93 - 1995-96)**  
*Stats:  23.4 ppg, 11.5 rpg, 4.4 apg, 50.1% fg, 30.1% 3fg*  
***Reasoning:***  Although Barkley only spent four seasons in Phoenix he is a Suns legend and an MVP. Barkley wasn't a great shooter but he dominated in so many ways that it wouldn't matter. His passing would be valuable to kick out to Nash or Booker on the perimeter when double-teamed or he could just take it inside by himself.

**C:  Larry Nance (1981-82 - 1987-88)**  
*Stats:  17.3 ppg, 7.8 rpg, 2.6 apg, 56.1% fg, 16.1% 3fg*  
***Reasoning:***  His numbers are brought down a bit by his rookie season, but Nance  was  a solid 20/8 player most of his time in Phoenix. All all-defense  level  player would be a great to have inside to help some of the poorer defenders on this team. He also won the dunk contest, which would make   him a great partner with Nash. At this point it was harder to get   players who weren't teammates so Nance just made the most sense.

**6:  Paul Westphal (1975-76 - 1979-80)**  
*Stats:  20.6 ppg, 2.2 rpg, 5.2 apg, 51.6% fg, 27.7% 3fg*  
***Reasoning:***    Westphal was an incredible scorer, leader, and good rebounder for his position. Having an NBA champion on this team and a guy who took us to the Finals is extremely valuable plus he brings confidence and efficiency off the bench.

**Conclusion:**  Overall,   I really like this team. With Nash running alongside two dunk champions  plus Booker and Barkley they would easily be the most  entertaining team in the league and would run most teams out of the gym. The main issues are defense and shooting, but I think those could be covered up by superior rebounding and athleticism and overall scoring  ability and talent. Having five players who averaged at least 4 assists  per game while on the Suns would also create a lot more open looks and  hopefully increase shooting percentages. I  also think the players would  be more efficient from three with Nash feeding them the ball.",nbadiscussion
1121,126,Thoughts on the Butler/Herro/DRob/Crowder/Olynyk lineup succeeding?,"Seems nobody is talking about this lineup that the Heat ran at the end of G3 (seemed like the whole 4th) that the Lakers had trouble guarding. It takes the bigs out the paint cause Olynyk can shoot, leaving the paint wide open for Butler to slash or Crowder/DRob to backdoor cut and it makes the handoffs that the Heat like to run, tough to guard

And on defense they had Crowder and Butler play up top while the other 3 played closer to the rim. How do the Lakers approach/beat this lineup for next game?",nbadiscussion
1122,127,Why do Teams Switch to Iso Offense During Clutch Moments?,"  

This is something that’s always confused me. Unless you’re the Rockets or maybe a select few other teams, isolation is generally considered to be an inefficient play. So why do so many teams go to it again and again when games and seasons are on the line? 

We’ve seen a great example of a team playing pure team basketball to great success in late game situations this postseason in the Heat. However, there seems to be a prevailing wisdom around the NBA that iso shots are needed late in games against better opponents. The classic example of this is the KD Warriors with KD saying, “The motion offense we run in Golden State, it only works to a certain point.” 

I’m unable to find the stats to investigate this myself but am wondering if any of you might know why so many teams use iso plays in clutch situations and if it is actually beneficial for them to do so?",nbadiscussion
1123,128,People are overreacting to Paul George’s struggles. He’s always been an inconsistent shooter and right now his jump shot just isn’t falling. He’s still had a positive impact on his team so far through his contributions in other areas.,"Watching him last night he wasn’t even having as terrible of a game as many said he did. I feel like a lot of fa are skewed by their hatred for him. He’s always been an inconsistent shooter and shooters tend to have off games in the playoffs.

He wasn’t even chucking up bad shots yesterday, they were mainly open/good shots that he normally would make. He’s not messing up the teams rhythm since their entire offensive strategy is built around having a couple players iso. Sure his shooting is struggling right now but he’ll almost certainly bounce back. Once he starts hitting those usual looks he’ll be fine.

He’s still contributing a lot in other areas. He almost had a triple double last night (11/9/7/2). He had 9 rebounds and 7 assists. His defense has been great and he had 2 steals yesterday. He’s looked a lot better as a playmaker and doing auxiliary stuff on the court. Even though his shots not falling he’s able to have a positive impact.

I guarantee you that sometime during this playoffs he’s going to have a game or two where he goes absolutely nuclear. It’s best that he has his cold slump right now and bounces back in later rounds, rather than having him choke deep in the postseason.",nbadiscussion
1124,129,Remembering That One Healthy Year of Yao and Tracy and How the Mavericks Halted the Hype,"Back when I was a kid, I used to have a Yao Ming poster. 


It wasn’t because I liked Yao Ming. I wasn’t a Rockets fan and honestly, at the time, I didn’t realize just how good Yao Ming was. As an east coast child, I didn’t realize teams existed in the west outside of the Spurs and the Lakers — those were the only two teams that mattered in my view. And Houston was supposed to change that, or at least join the picture. So when a bingo night in elementary school lead to me now owning a Yao Ming poster, I guess I had to watch him.


It was perfect timing because that was the 2004-05 Houston Rockets season and more importantly, it was the one healthy year we got of Yao Ming and Tracy McGrady.

----
We start back in 1999. In his late teens, Yao Ming would be pressured to make the move to America and join the association. Being pressured by the management of the Shanghai Sharks, he would consider the option but would wait until 2002 to make the move. Partially because of horrible contracts with an agency, partially because he stock would skyrocket with time. 


He would literally have a group of advisers to monitor his value, the Chinese government would have investment in the young man — including their creation of regulations to take money out of Ming’s pockets. Seriously, the whole situation of how Yao Ming was brought over to the NBA is incredibly fascinating and a little bit depressing. The lack of a oral history on the situation or some 30-for-30 is surprising. 


Yao was not the consensus overall first pick that year from a talent perspective. From the college level, you had the incredible Duke team that choked against Indiana in March Madness — leading to Maryland winning it all (never forget). It was thought that Jay Williams, being the greatest college basketball point guard of all-time, could go first overall. However, the Chinese basketball market was lucrative. You weren't necessarily drafting Yao for Yao. You were drafting Yao for China. 


So Yao would go first overall. He had to. You had to have a formal letter from the Shanghai Sharks that you could draft him. 


His first year wouldn’t officially start until he faced a healthy Shaq in January, where he would go pound-for-pound with the man that had attempted to bury his career with his words. Yao wouldn't be taken seriously until he met a real threat- similar to how fighters aren't taken seriously until they meet a proper match. O’Neal would start the game, attempting to cross over Yao Ming in the left corner only to be met by the right hand of Yao Ming stopping his shop. It was an incredibly cocky move with an incredibly poor execution. The next possession, you knew the Rockets would return the favor—getting the ball to Yao in the low post. However, Ming would go with the soft hook for two. 


Ming was real. 


He would get beat out for Rookie of the Year by Amar’e Stoudamire — in which both players deserved the award but, you know, reasons lead for  Stoudamire to get the nod. Seriously, it was a weird year where you would see a lot of questionable comments from ESPN writers, O’Neal and they would play it off as not racist—and Yao would agree — but you could also see why it was interpreted that way.


The Rockets would miss the play-offs by one game but still, the 15-game improvement was a sign of greater things to come. And when Rudy Tomjanovich had to resign due to bladder cancer, it was a blessing in disguise.


Jeff Van Gundy would take over the ropes and develop the system around Yao, truly looking to get the most of the out of big man. It would work because they would make the play-offs in his first season as head coach, only to exit the first round against the Lakers. Van Gundy's usage of a 2-man game was all Yao truly needed -- having him work off of screens or in the low post. 


So entering the summer of 2004, the Rockets had time to think. The team clearly wanted to go all-in around Yao, who would be their target?


---

Tracy McGrady was not happy in Orlando. 


The man that managed to win back-to-back scoring titles on the Magic, despite the team missing the play-offs in 03-04, wanted out. Injuries had plagued the team and Doc Rivers’ departure mid-season meant the team didn’t sit well with the man in his prime. His confused for why this team sucked so much and why management wasn't doing anything to assist made sense. 


McGrady had established himself as one of the best players in the league and requesting a trade was huge news. It would be even crazier because Orlando would have the first pick in the draft and would select a man named Dwight Howard. He really did want out.


The timing was perfect for Houston. Steve Francis didn’t like the changes Van Gundy was making which meant his name was available. Despite being an incredible guard, he would be traded—along with his best friend on the team Cuttino Mobley, and Kelvin Cato’s bad contract—to Orlando for T-Mac, Juwan Howard’s bad contract, Tyronn Lue and Reece Gaines. 


It was a mega move but a move to hopefully stop the dominance of the two teams in the West. It was meant to change the tides of time.


It worked to a degree. 

---
The regular season would start off slow. McGrady was different from the previous backcourt, which meant there was a learning curve to the Van Gundy offense. Tracy’s ability to be strong on the boards was a nice addition but also took away some of the thunder Yao brought. Van Gundy’s vision of building around Yao slowly became a vision of McGrady and Yao coexisting in the same system, which meant a lot spacing for the scoring star while setting Yao in a position to succeed in the post. Incorporating more isolation opportunities for McGrady as well as still using Yao's presence early on in a possession would be the fix. 


Tracy would have his career defining moment of 13 points in 33 seconds against the Spurs on December 9th, the team would slowly come to form earning a play-off spot as the 3rd seed in the Southwest division and more importantly, things were looking good for Houston.


The Rockets were seen as championship contenders but possibly in a tier below the remaining old guard. They were a defensive team that would rely on McGrady and Yao to score nearly all of their points and it would work. It would make sense because here was their starting line-up going into the play-offs: McGrady, David Wesley, Ryan Bowen, Bob Sura and Yao.  Jon Barry, Mike James and Dikembe would come off the bench. This wasn’t your prototypical championship caliber team, it was the hope that two incredible players could do incredible things.


But the Western conference was open for the taking. Shaq was out of Los Angeles and was now in the East — meaning Yao would be relatively uncontested in the low post. The Phoenix Suns would sign an unrestricted free agent named Steve Nash and would pair him with their new coach — Mike D’Antoni-- and Amar'e. The ‘Malice at the Palace’ would happen. The Wizards and the Bulls would make the play-offs in the east and the Lakers would miss the play-offs. It was an underrated crazy season. 


Which meant a first round match-up between Dallas and Houston would be a must watch. I found out recently that Houston and Dallas fans hate each other which meant that the I-45 match-up wouldn’t be your every day battle. 


Dallas had an up-and-down year. Don Nelson would step-down mid-season and Avery Johnson would takeover. Under Johnson, they would win their final nine to earn the second spot in the Southwest division and a 4 seed in the West. The match-up was even and more importantly, they could avoid the Spurs in the second round. But first, they had to get through each other.


Game 1 would take place in Dallas but you thought it would have been McGrady’s court at home. A pissed-off Mark Cuban with long hair would have to watch McGrady for 51.9% from the field, on 27 shots, scoring 34 points in 46 minutes. Early foul trouble on Yao wouldn’t matter as Dirk Nowitzki couldn’t find his form, going 5 for 19 from the field.


Dallas couldn’t match-up with the size differences McGrady and Yao brought to their roles. At times, it felt like Johnson was testing to figure out what he could do — sometimes having Dirk guard Yao and immediately regretting that decision. And as much as they would focus on Yao in the early stages, Tracy would just be dominating Stackhouse, Terry, Finley, [Dirk](https://youtu.be/yPsURFSVpmo?t=90) whoever they had on the court.


They had to figure it out fast because Yao wouldn’t get the calls that would limit his game 1 performance. *Right….*


At least they wouldn’t in Game 2. Yao Ming would start off the first quarter going 5 for 5 from the field, 7 for 7 from the line and only committing one foul. Meanwhile, Tracy had a hefty 10 points to start the game as [well as an incredible and-one](https://youtu.be/rK6galQrajw?t=69). Dallas was able to keep it close with 30 points in an overall team effort but they to stop the Rockets from blasting off. 


The fouls would come again. Tracy would have 3 fouls but more importantly, the Rockets were fouling Dirk. It would become a common theme that Dirk would draw fouls. Dirk would get foul with his signature jumper—refs would think there would be contact when in reality, Dirk was incredible at spacing himself. Dirk was used to getting to the stripe 5-7 times a game. this series, he would see the line 13, 12, 10, 9, and 9 times respectively -- which felt kind of unreal. 


It was a physical series — as you would expect with the play-offs — but at times, the fouls didn’t fit the crimes at times. Fans would become upset and did lead to match-fixing allegations down the line. 


The second half adjustment from the Mavericks would finally give them a lead. If they could get the ball away from Yao and McGrady, it would force other places on the Rockets to make shots. It was a good idea.The duo would only combine for 10 field goal attempts but as fouls would linger on McGrady and Yao, their defensive efforts would be limited. Meanwhile, Dirk would have a quiet third quarter, possibly bracing for what would be a war in the fourth. 


All that would matter would be the last 30-seconds of the game. The quarter would feature the match-up we all expected, Dirk versus Yao and Tracy but missed shots from Jason Terry, Finley and Howard gave a little less support to Dirk from the solid role-player work of Bob Sura, Jon Barry and Mike James. 

 [Dallas would have the ball down 2 with 29.3 after a missed jumper from Tracy](https://youtu.be/I5XRN4KvYJ8?t=19). Dirk would get the ball at the right elbow after a screen, leading to Tracy taking on the 7 footer. In a vintage dirk move, he would dribble to the middle of the paint, spin his back to the basket and rotate out into a fadeaway that only Dirk would do. It was a free two-points.

Houston would intentionally not call a timeout and force Dallas to react to what was in front of them. The world knew that Yao or Tracy would take the final shot, the question was how. Exactly how you would want it, a high screen from Yao with the floor spaced lead to a free look from just inside the three-point line. He wouldn’t miss.


What felt like an iconic moment was Yao running like a giraffe to hug Tracy, only to be contrasted by another pissed off image of long haired Mark Cuban. TNT would run a statistic that Houston Rockets were 7-0 all-time when they lead a series 2-0. And with 2.2 seconds left, Dirk would not get the ball but Michael Finley would and his jumper would not go.  


The basketball universe was in flux. The night before, the Nuggets took a game off of the Spurs. Now, the Rockets were up 2-0 to the favored Mavericks. Something wasn’t right in the world. 


The Mavericks knew they would have to win game 3 and avoid criticism of being a team that simply got hot late in the season. Both teams would battle it out early, totaling 12 fouls and 9 turnovers. Yao again would be plagued by early, questionable fouls but the Mavericks would only be able to take advantage of his foul trouble late in the quarter, getting a much needed 5 point lead.  


The second quarter would not be prettier as fouls and turnovers continued to add up.Dirk  and Tracy would account for 40% of the total points in that quarter. The bigger problem came with Dikembe, Ryan Bowen and Yao all having 3 fouls in the first half, limiting the threat of size on the Rockets that they used so well to their advantage. One of them would be punished.


Bowen’s 2 fouls added more to the fire and his replacement, Scott Padgett, managed to rack up 3 fouls as his replacement in 10 minutes. But the Rockets were able to get back into the game. Tracy, Yao and David Wesley accounted for 24 points while Dirk searched for his teammates as Terry, Dampier and Josh Howard would go scoreless. Jerry Stackhouse’s 7 points eased the pain but a 10 point differential in the third quarter gave the Rockets the lead. 


But Dirk didn’t know what a shadow looked like. He couldn’t stand in the shadow of the Tracy and Yao show. With 8:14 to go, Dallas would go on an 18-0 run as Yao and Bowen would foul out. Tracy would go 1 for 5 in the fourth and a quarter that would only have the Rockets score 19 points felt like the Mavericks were finally making their appearance in the playoffs. 


Game 4 was up for grabs. Slowly, questions regarding the officiating began to take place. It was an underlying storyline to the series that it felt as if there were questionable calls made — both ways. And with all of the light shining on the stars, people were watching the calls closely. 


The first half would feature much of the same. Two early fouls from Yao would limit his performance but Tracy would still finish the first half with 17 points. Meanwhile, Dirk  was still killing the Rockets from the line — despite shooting 2 of 7 from the field — and he was getting needed support from Finley, Terry, Howard and Stackhouse. A 3-point lead for the Rockets to finish the half wasn’t going to be enough, we all knew there would need to be a spark in the second half to determine the fate of Game 4.


That spark plug would be The JET. Jason Terry wasn’t having an incredible series. But with Dirk struggling again in the second half, the Mavs needed someone to step up to numb the pain that would be 30 points from Yao and Tracy in the second half. 


Terry would go 8 for 13, 5 for 7 from deep and more importantly, only commit 2 turnovers. The big men from both teams getting into foul trouble meant that the floor would become incredibly wide open, allowing for scorers to do what they do best.


[Dallas would have a 1 point lead with 45 seconds to-go and as Jason Terry brought up the ball](https://youtu.be/IZIyBeHTJe8?t=193), it was the rare situation where you knew Dirk would not be getting the ball. Tracy would pick-up Dirk however a high screen would lead to McGrady guarding Terry out on the wing. It felt like the perfect situation for the Rockets as McGrady would stop the drive from Terry and force him to keep dribbling.  


As JT would bring the ball back to around the perimeter, McGrady poked the ball, leading to a scramble at the top of key. High in the sky, the ball would fall into the hands of Dirk, who would kick it out to Terry, alone on the wing. And the hot man stayed hot, drilling the three point shot and leaving the Rockets with their hands on their heads. The stars aligned for Dallas. 


It was a heart breaker in Houston. Game 5 would feel like a forecasted loss. Tracy McGrady couldn’t find his shot in the first half — going 4 for 12 from the field and getting 13 points. Meanwhile, the Mavericks' success was a continued team effort, even with Jason Terry returning back to earth with his 0 shots made in the first half. 


Things would stay the same except this time, the beast from the far east was awoken. 22 points in the second half, 15 points in the fourth kept things interesting. But his 3 of 8 shooting from the line in the fourth was as disastrous as Tracy McGrady’s shooting. Every opportunity the Rockets would do to keep the game close, the Mavs would match it. The 3 point loss wasn’t as heartbreaking as people thought, as Tracy was simply having an off night, but it would mean we could expect to see Game 7. 


Game 6 wouldn’t start the way the Rockets were expecting.Tracy would start off hot — 5 for 7 from the field, but his team would struggle. 2 fouls early again for Yao removed some of the scoring potential of the Rockets and they would only score 18 points — mitigating Dirk’s poor start once again. 


They would pop-off in the second quarter, thanks to Mike James’ 13 points and Tracy’s 9 but more importantly, the collective of the Mavericks couldn’t find the bottom of the nets.But the half-time break would again shift things. Dirk was still terrible but Michael Finley made his presence known with 10 points.Tracy and Yao would struggle from the field and again, the lead was back into the hands of Dallas.


And, as the story goes with this game, it meant the Rockets were going to have hot 4th — which they did. But the Mavericks would also only score 13 points in the 4th. Yao and Bob Sura wouldn’t play in the 4th, Jon Barry would have 12, Mike James would have 9 and Tracy would seal the deal with 11. It was an ugly game, one you sort of just want to forget when you’re entering a Game 7 environment. It was the clown act between two redneck demolition derbies. 


The stage was set. Two teams that did not like each other, in a physical series, would get a chance to break each other’s hearts. You would think it would be an incredible bruiser game, battle to the end. 


It was not. 


A game that would require Yao and Tracy to be at their best simply would not work in their favor. Their star efforts weren’t enough in a team environment. Now, I should mention that Tracy struggled to start the game — going 3 for 9 from the field and Dirk was again struggling with his 4 first-quarter points. But only 3 players on the rockets scored in the first quarter — compared to 6 from the Macs.


A 12-point cushion to start a Game 7 usually doesn’t feel like it can last, except for this time. It felt like it would last in this game. Tracy and Yao scoring a combined 20 points would normally mean that the Rockets were on their way back but Jason Terry would again, be a critical spark plug with 15 points in the second. Yao would also return to foul trouble with 3 fouls in the first half and elimination continued to creep. Yao would have to battle through the third quarter despite picking up his fourth however it wasn’t much help because again, the team of the Dallas Mavericks was greater than the two of the Rockets. This time Yao, Tracy and Scott Padgett would be the only 3 to record points in the third while 7 Maverick players would produce points on the scoreboards. 


The Rockets were begging for foul calls but weren’t getting them.  They would only get to the stripe 7 times in the first half. The Mavs: 17 times. General frustration, the depression that comes with possibly being eliminated remained in the minds of the Rockets during the second half. 


Yao’s 33, Tracy’s 27 weren’t enough. The 16-point performance from the rest of their teammates was the story of this roster. Jason Terry’s 31, Josh Howard’s 21 and respectable 13 and 14 points from Finley and Dirk would lead to the departure of the Rockets from the play-offs, in what was a brutal end to the first season of Yao and Tracy.


Dallas would go on to lose to the Phoenix Suns that showed they were real western conference contenders  but more importantly, it felt like they broke Houston’s chances at being one of the top teams in the west. The following season would be a waste as both Tracy and Yao missed a significant amount of games due to injury. The roster would continued to survive and but also continue to struggle to make it out of the first round. And when they did, it was 2009 where Tracy would have a season-ending knee injury, Ron Artest would be on the team and Yao Ming would miss the second round match-up against the Lakers and would cost the team an opportunity at the Western Conference finals.


It was unfortunate we never saw a second opportunity but then again, I don’t know if it would be a better performance. The Rockets wouldn’t be able to add support for the duo, a coaching change would stall the progression Van Gundy had made and more importantly, the duo would never rebound from health issues. Despite the greatness in skills, the cards weren't in their favor.


Instead, they will remain one of the biggest what-ifs in our basketball life time. Two hall of famers wouldn’t be able to get out of the first round at their peaks. Instead, the good fortune would shift to the Dallas who would find success as one of the best during the period of time where Kobe would re-build Los Angeles, San Antonio would do San Antonio things, and we had the house of the rising suns in Phoenix. Utah and Memphis would remain staples as the team that ""might do it this year"" and it would last us until a group of three players would kick off the start of a new generation of basketball in Oklahoma City.


But for a period of time, Houston was in the picture. The picture was foggy, a little difficult to see but it existed.",nbadiscussion

I came across the site yesterday and I believe it could be a really useful tool to the community to highlight specific plays that occur in a NBA game. This should make discussion easier when describing a certain highlight or action.

For example, let's pick something random in last night's game, let's search for any fouls made by Bam Adebayo in the fourth quarter. We get this [clip](https://3ball.io/plays?evtt=6&p1id=1628389&p=4&playId=0041900302_587). Even shows the ref who called the foul. Pretty neat I think.

Since I just found out about this yesterday I am still figuring out all the search features, but there are many things to choose from: different types of shots (make and miss), rebounds, turnovers, fouls, jumpballs; and then can narrow down even further with things like period, who it was assisted by, who was it blocked by, etc.",nbadiscussion

>... Then there’s his scoring. **Historians have mislabeled Wilt as the game’s most “dominant” scorer, but that epitaph should belong to Jordan.** He holds the [highest pace-adjusted scoring rate](https://stathead.com/basketball/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&match=single&order_by_asc=0&order_by=pts_per_poss&qual=pts_per_g_req&per_minute_base=36&type=per_poss&per_poss_base=100&is_playoffs=N&ccomp=gt&positions%5B%5D=G&positions%5B%5D=GF&positions%5B%5D=F&positions%5B%5D=FG&positions%5B%5D=FC&positions%5B%5D=C&positions%5B%5D=CF&lg_id=NBA&birth_country_is=Y&age_min=0&age_max=99&height_min=0&height_max=99&season_start=1&season_end=-1&college_id=0&as_comp=gt&as_val=0) in NBA history (since eclipsed by '19 James Harden) and six of the nine highest-scoring rates of all time. He litters the record book with more high-efficiency, high-volume seasons than anyone:

>[**GRAPH**](https://backpicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Jordan-Volume-and-Efficiency.png)

>A more selective filter demonstrates Jordan’s singular brilliance: In only 15 NBA seasons has someone scored over 30 per 75 at +6 percent rTS, and Jordan owns four of them (Karl Malone and Harden each have two, Shaq, LeBron, Curry and Kevin Durant have one each). His scoring game was so resilient that in the postseason he upped his volume and creation with almost no loss in efficiency. This coincided with Chicago’s slight improvement in relative playoff offense during the ’90s, as the Bulls generated a +7.3 postseason rating with Jordan, an eight-season mark bested only by Magic’s Lakers from 1984-91.9

>**In 1990, Jackson introduced the triangle, an offense with a notorious learning curve. The Bulls arc that year reflected some growing pains; their first-half was comparable to previous seasons, teetering along at a 45-win pace until the All-Star game before a dynasty blossomed. There’s a near perfect trajectory from the All-Star break into the heart of the ’91 season as Chicago ascended from coach to first class. Here’s what its rolling point-differential looked like over the period:**

>[(**The graph this post is referring to**)](https://backpicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Bulls-90-to-91-Growth.png)

>Fittingly, almost all of this change occurred on offense. With Pippen and Grant entering their primes, the Bulls first-half attack that year was a respectable 2.6 points better than league average. But, for the first time in Jordan’s six seasons, it moved into the upper atmosphere after the break. Chicago’s rORtg was +6.3 in the second-half (including postseason), which would place it in the top-35 of all time for a full year, and at the time would have been the seventh-best offense ever. The 1991 Bulls were a similar +6.7 on offense.

>In 1992, Chicago peaked at +7.4, the 12th-best offense ever, and one of three attacks in history with a raw efficiency above 115.5 points per 100. After three consecutive top-100 offensive seasons, Jordan took a baseball sabbatical and the Bulls scoring efficiency dropped to 2 points above league average. In 1995, before his return, Chicago chugged along at +1.2 for 63 games (playing at a 52-win pace), reinforcing the team’s competence but also highlighting Jordan’s value — lifting slightly above average offenses by 5 or 6 points is GOAT-worthy. After nearly two seasons off, MJ (posting a cringeworthy -2.6 percent rTS) lifted the ’95 team’s offense to +4.3 in his 27 games (at a 59-win pace). Again, the turnovers declined, down to 12.1 percent from 14.6. Even an oxidized Jordan made an impact.

>With the rust off in ’96, MJ led Chicago to two of the 10-best offensive seasons ever, including the fourth-best of all time in 1997.10 They also benefited from the shortening of the 3-point line, as both Jordan and Pippen were better marksmen from the shorter stripe (in place from 1995-97). The height of four of the Bulls six title teams was staggering:

EDIT:

MJ has the highest ***peak*** on the list, though he ranks 3rd overall. This list ranks the **most valuable overall careers**, so longevity is rewarded. It is stated that he might easily have finished 1st had his 'missing' years in 86 and 94-95 followed the rest of his surrounding seasons-

>... *More importantly, Jordan lacked longevity, missing a year in ’94 and logging partial seasons in ’86 and ’95, both of which cost him valuable GOAT mileage. By my valuations, he composed 10 MVP-level seasons, compared to 12 for Kareem and Russell. If MJ’s injured seasons followed his valuations curve, he would have a strong argument for No. 1, and if his hypothetical 1994 season followed the curve, he would likely be No. 1 on this list. While I can see giving him slightly more credit, he could only finish first with his current longevity if I viewed his peak as an outlier among outliers, and neither box metrics nor non-box data support that idea. If anything, they suggest Jordan’s GOAT peak status isn’t unassailable, which means there’s also an argument for him dropping back a slot. Therefore, he’s my highest peak player, but falls short in career value to Abdul-Jabbar, landing at No. 2.*

[**LeBron James's**](https://backpicks.com/2018/04/05/backpicks-goat-3-lebron-james/) combination of peak and longevity ranks him at 2 at the moment - he was 3rd when the series was written but he was moved up to 2nd after the 2018 playoffs- 

>... *In total, Jordan is the only comparable perimeter peak in history, although* ***James’s*** *defense was slightly more impressive at its apex. Eight of LeBron’s last nine seasons are all-time level campaigns, pairing either good or great defense with transcendent offense. He’s logged enough mileage to challenge Jordan; this will be his 14th season on the All-NBA team, whereas MJ only made 11. Like the other great megastars who excel in non-scoring phases of the game, I do wonder if I’m undervaluing LeBron, given the unique shape of his offense.*

>... *In a few weeks, he will likely move to No. 2 on this list. If I had fewer reservations about his ball-dominance scaling (and his lack of spot-up shooting), he’d be a spot higher already, and I do think he has an outside argument as the highest-peak player in NBA history. And, barring injury or premature retirement, James will likely retire with the most valuable career ever. For now, he’s etched on the Mt. Rushmore of the sport at No. 3.*

[**Kareem Abdul Jabbar's**](https://backpicks.com/2018/04/12/backpicks-goat-1-kareem-abdul-jabbar) very good peak, but more importantly, his consistent 15-20-year excellence lands him at no. 1-

>... *Yes, others were better at their best, but* ***Jabbar*** *passes them with the most impressive longevity in NBA history, finishing with the most All-Star years (17) and MVP-level seasons (10) in this series. Put another way, his Lakers career alone was longer than Magic Johnson’s entire career (and nearly as valuable), and he played six all-world years before that in Milwaukee. His drop in mobility (per the scouting report) reduced him to a marginal defender during many of those later seasons, but size kept him relevant, and I credit him with seven strong All-Star campaigns in the ’80s alone and three MVP-level years at the beginning of that decade. At his best, he was an elite offensive anchor and a strong defender with a number of monstrous value-signals, enough for me to give him a top-eight peak of all time. My valuations even feel conservative because of how tricky it is to weigh his dominance in the early ’70s; he smoked the competition, but it was the strangest period in league history, with teams stretched thin by expansion. His lead over the field is large enough that I’d have to downgrade his prime seasons by nearly 10 percent just to pull him off the top line. So, the most reasonable conclusion is that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar authored the best career in NBA history.*

High-peak but lower longevity greats like [**Bird**](https://backpicks.com/2018/01/11/backpicks-goat-11-larry-bird/) and [**Magic**](https://backpicks.com/2018/01/15/backpicks-goat-10-magic-johnson/) are docked places accordingly.

>... *In total,* ***Bird*** *has the imprint of a GOAT-level offensive player with a clear case as a strong defensive factor early in his career. However, like so many other superstars, his offensive peak didn’t coincide with his best defensive seasons, making it less likely that he was a top-5 peak player ever. By my valuations, Bird’s first eight years are MVP-worthy, including one of the best two-year apexes in NBA history with an argument for the best post-merger rookie season. I do wonder how much credit to give his non-traditional offensive traits, but either way, minor adjustments up or down don’t move Bird much on the list. With a phenomenal peak and problematic longevity, he lands here, barely behind No. 10.*

>... *Collectively, the film and data scream that* ***Johnson*** *was one of the very best offensive players in history. His WOWYR numbers are fantastic, finishing first in the 2016 results, and near the top in all regressed game-level studies. His team’s offenses were even better in the postseason, improving by a weighted average of 2.5 efficiency points. However, Magic’s defensive work dings him somewhat among the other greats, as he was likely a neutral-impact defender in the early part of his career before his defense waned in later seasons. But it’s his longevity that costs him most on this list, as HIV stole valuable prime years for him to climb up the top-10. All told, I consider Magic’s peak just short of the all-time greats, not only due to his defense, but because his ball-dominance introduces redundancies on good teams. On the flip side, because his offenses were so good, and his style somewhat unique, I can see an outside argument for him reaching Wilt and the next block of players. Either way, what’s clear is that with two more years comparable to his ’91 campaign, he would move up multiple spots, and with three similar seasons would be pushing the top five. Instead, he narrowly edges rival Larry Bird for the 10th-most valuable career in NBA history.*

1127,132,Teams with 3 players scoring 20 PPG in a season - Quarantine Basketball Reference Findings,"^(In the next episode of my quarantine) [^(basketball-reference.com)](https://basketball.reference.com) ^(findings, I searched for teams who had three players all average 20 PPG or more in that season. This list has an amazing diversity among well-known offenses and under the radar teams. I have placed a requirement of playing at least 50 games in the season for that team, and looking at the 3-Point era only.)

**Run & Gun: 1980-1983 Denver Nuggets**

In the earliest iteration of 3 players averaging 20 or more, these Denver teams managed to accomplish this **THREE** seasons in a row. Dan Issel and Alex English contributed to all three with Kiki Vandeweghe playing the final two after David Thompson's 1981 season. Doug Moe's teams of the 80s hold countless records for high scoring, perennially leading the league in scoring and points allowed

**The X-Men: 1986-1988 Seattle SuperSonics**

In true underdog fashion this team advanced to the WCF despite a losing record, behind Xavier McDaniel (X-Man), Tom Chambers (Tommy Gun) and Dale Ellis (Lamar Mundane) all averaging above 23 PPG in 87. All three players were in their primes while averaging 20s for two seasons in a row, accounting for at least 60% of their teams points both seasons

**We Believed: 2007-2008 Golden State Warriors**

In the year after the famous ""We Believe"" playoff run, Monta Ellis, Baron Davis and Stephen Jackson looked poised to make a return to the playoffs. However, they became the team with the best record to miss the playoffs in the 3 Point era. At 48 wins and 34 losses they won 6 more games than the previous year, but to no avail!

**Sleep Train Arena Legends: 2013-2014 Sacramento Kings**

In the midst of the horror show that is the 2010s Kings, there is few bright spots, one being the 2014 Kings. A young group of Boogie Cousins, Isaiah Thomas and midseason acquisition Rudy Gay scored 60% of the measly Kings points that season. A combination of injuries and classic Kings-style transactions led to this group never playing together again.

**Tampering: 2018-2019 New Orleans Pelicans**

In a season marred by tampering fines and holdouts on the parts of the Lakers, Pelicans, and Anthony Davis; Jrue Holiday and Julius Randle quietly helped put together the rare three player 20 PPG season. This team will most likely only be remembered for the whirlwind talks surrounding the Brow.

**Run TMC: 1990-1991 Golden State Warriors**

Before the Splash Bros, there was Run TMC, with Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond and Chris Mullin's two seasons together being immortalized their Run DMC nickname. Despite the attention to these teams, there is more nostalgia than success, being the bridge between the Rick Barry Warriors and the We Believe teams

**Before Barkley: 1983-1984 Philadelphia 76ers**

in the season after the infamous ""fo fo fo"" Championship Sixers, Julius Erving, Moses Malone and Andrew Toney replicated their chemistry to each average 20 PPG. Despite the disappointment of not defending their title, being knocked out in the first round, their consolation came with the drafting of Charles Barkley in the following season.

**The Johnsons: 1988-1989 Phoenix Suns**

With Tom Chambers signed with the Suns coming from the aforementioned Sonics, joining a young Kevin Johnson and high scorer Eddie Johnson. This team made the 8th best season improvement in wins, going from a dismal 28 wins to 55 wins and a WCF appearance. This grouping would later contribute to Charles Barkley's 93 Suns

**Splash Bros: 2016-2019 Golden State Warriors**

In the least surprising addition to this list, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant last three seasons together were memorable. Amazingly, Curry and Durant both averaged at least 25 points each of these three seasons. Not much else to say about this dynasty

**Just Barely Counts: 2019-2020 Boston Celtics \***

In the cut short season, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum and Kemba Walker are on pace to reach this rare accomplishment, having all played 50 games while averaging over 20 PPG. This can be considered an asterisk as their averages may dip if the season resumes.",nbadiscussion

1129,134,Are we 100% sure that Kyle Kuzma is good?,"I'll probably get a lot of hate for this post, but hear me out: I believe that since Kuzma had such an unexpectedly great rookie year, he has been overrated for the past couple of years since people saw him immediately as good.

I'll start with the most over-blown part of his game: his shooting. In college, he shot just below 2 threes a game and 30% from deep in his career, never shooting above 32.4%. Then, he comes into the NBA guns blazing and about 5.5 a game at a clip of 36.5%, a percentage and quantity of threes that lead many people, including myself, to believe that he was a great shooter. He dipped down the next year in 18-19, as though he shot more threes at 6 a game, he only made around 30%, though Kuz was still being credited as being a vital shooting threat to surround LeBron. After the Lakers acquired Anthony Davis from the Pels, I saw a ton of people wondering how they would fit Kuzma into the starting lineup with LeBron and AD, only for the Lakers to make what has looked like the right decision so far of having Kuz come off of the bench. For a guy that there were many reports about being the one piece that the Lakers weren't willing to give the Pels in their pursuit of AD, Kuzma hasn't really been the biggest contributor to the team, and his shooting has dipped even further. The drop in from 6 threes a game to 4.5 is expected when you're coming off of the bench, but the drop barely below 30% shooting from three confirmed the evidence that was right in front of us that Kyle has probably never been that great of a shooter, and just happened to have his best year as a rookie. This stroke of luck made us as fans expect that he would not only maintain that ability, but build on it, which Kyle has done the exact opposite of.

Kuzma does still provide a scoring punch, but especially during this past year, his efficiency is just not there. Maybe he's able to score 19 PPG on 45.5% field goal percentage, which is great, but in a more limited role, which in theory should allow Kuzma to pick his shots more and increase that FG %, he instead dropped to 43% with 12.5 PPG, while averaging the same numbers that he did during his rookie year per 36, but just less efficiently. Not to say that Kuz is a bad scorer, because he definitley is a pretty solid bucket-getter, but he's already regressed from his rookie year when he was put in a role that wasn't focused on him being the number two or three option, which is concerning.

Kuz doesn't provide much outside of scoring, as he has never averaged more than 2.5 APG, with an honestly putrid ratio of 1.3/1.6 assist to turnover ratio. In addition to his lack of passing ability, Kuz has never been a very good rebounder, peaking at 6 a game in his rookie year, and only going down from that number ever since. I know that this year his stats will be lowered since he is playing less, but even if you look at his per 36 minutes stats, he has regressed to a worse version of his rookie self.

Outside of the more surface-level stats, Kuz is a bad defender at 6'8"" without a ton of athleticism, and he has never even averaged above a combined 1 steal and block per game. He also doesn't provide very much off of the ball on offense as far as I have seen, and though I bet that there will be some people that will argue that his shooting provides an off the ball threat, there is really no proof outside of his rookie year that at any point in the past 6 years since Kuz made his college debut that he is a good shooter from three.

The main reason that Kuz's regression scares me so much is that if he is going to contribute on a championship-level team like he is on now, his best role will not come in the role that he was in during his rookie and sophomore seasons as a number two or three option and big minutes starter (spoiler alert - the teams weren't winning). This year, he has been the instant scoring punch off of the bench for the Lakers, which I believe is the role that he should be playing on a winning team, but he has also had his worst season yet, lacking the ability to efficiently score or stretch the floor when he isn't playing big starter minutes. If Kuz can't score efficiently, he really isn't providing much else to your team, and I personally would rather have guys like Danny Green or Avery Bradley play for the Lakers. Guys like Green and Bradley don't demand shots like Kuz, they can play off of stars like LeBron, and if they are having a rough scoring night, they can still lock-up someone on the opposing team. If Kuz is off, which he has been at points during his very up and down season this past year, he gives you nothing, and unless he has a great playoffs this year or a good year next year, I'm off the Kuz train.

When I was thinking about the idea for this post, I originally wanted to focus on a broader phenomenon that I have noticed that if a player surprises everyone as a rookie or has a fantastic rookie year, they will be looked at as the level of player that they established themselves as during their rookie year, no matter whether they regress or not. This isn't just a basketball thing, as I am a Saints fan for the NFL, and our star cornerback in Marshon Lattimore had an incredible rookie year that earned him All-Pro honors, which made everyone view him as a top corner in the league. I have watched every game but maybe two or three during the past two years for the Saints, and Lattimore has consistently not played like even a Pro Bowl level corner for the Saints. He has kept his reputation, however, because every now and then, he will have a game like when he held Mike Evans to 0 catches that shows that he has the talent, but not the consistent focus, of a top corner. Marshon frustrates me because the Saints will likely pay him like he is a top 3 corner in the NFL off of reputation rather than production, while guys who have produced more, but maybe struggled more out of the gate will get less. A basketball comparison is Lonzo Ball, who came into the league being hyped-up by his dad to be ""better than Steph,"" and though Lonzo struggled with his bizarre shot as a rookie, especially as a rookie PG, he has become a pretty good shooter, making over 38% of his attempts on 6.5 per game from three. Though Lonzo has proven himself to be a good shooter now, I guarantee you that if I were to ask the average basketball fan who is a better shooter between Kuzma and Lonzo, over 90% would say Kuz, even though there isn't a stat that could back that up.

Just don't give up on guys after a rough rookie year, especially rookie PGs (I see you everyone that is calling Darius Garland a bust already), unless they are on a completely different level of sucking after shooting-up draft boards unexpectedly before the draft, like Jarrett Culver. On the flip side, don't say that someone is good because of some performance that they had two years ago (injuries are a semi-exception to this rule), like Kuz, Kevin Knox, and Dennis Smith Jr. (How the Knicks managed to acquire two guys who looked like they had bright futures a year or two ago to being two of the worst players in the NBA is beyond my comprehension, the Knick's ineptness as a front office continues to amaze me).",nbadiscussion

This got me wondering who is the best NBA player to never receive a single MVP vote. I took to Basketball-Reference.com Award pages, put every MVP voting page into a spreadsheet, crossed that data with career-WS, and this is the Top-5 ordered by WS:


Player | WS | From | To
------|--|----|--
**Pau Gasol** | 144.1 | 2002 | 2019
**Horace Grant** | 118.2 | 1988 | 2004
**Jeff Hornacek** | 108.9 | 1987 | 2000
**Otis Thorpe** | 106.4 | 1985 | 2001
**Sam Perkins** | 105.4 | 1985 | 2001

Other notable players snubbed: Mo Cheeks (103.5 WS), Tyson Chandler (102.1), Jason Terry (102), Andre Miller (100.8), Andre Iguodala (96.8).

Obviously, the votes come in single seasons and not over the entirety of a player's career, and that means that players with ""lower"" total WS could still have put on a monster single-season and get a vote, or on the contrary have ""average"" seasons every year they played but bulked their WS total by staying in the league for long.

Even with that, finding Pau there really surprised me considering how good he was during the late-00s helping Kobe winning those two chips. The fact that Gasol along with the other names mentioned never got to get a single MVP vote (whether it was first-place or last-place in the ballot) is kinda staggering.

Do you consider Gasol the best player to never get voted, or would you put another name up there?",nbadiscussion
1131,136,"Hot take-The Great All-Star Snubbage of 2020 is a testament to the insane talent pool in the league and to the 3 point shot's evolution. When you have players on nearly every team averaging 25, you are forced to take W/L into affect which causes some All-Star caliber players to be snubbed.","Back 20 years ago, averaging 25+ PPG would give you a lock as an all star, if not an all NBA first teamer, but today, the league has changed. Averaging 25 PPG is the bare minimum for a player who wants to be considered a ""Superstar"" in today's NBA. The next step is winning. A player like Devin Booker is most definitely an all star caliber player, and his stats reflect that, but when almost every team has a player who is averaging 25 PPG, you have to look at that team's success to judge whether its star player is truly an all star.

Obviously there are some exceptions (Brandon Ingram and Trae Young jumps out at me) where the team has not found success, but I don't really think it should be debatable if Booker should make the all star team over Mitchell, who has likely led his team to a comfortable spot in the playoffs, despite averaging a few less points.

The reality is-Averaging high PPG in the NBA isn't what it used to be, with the insane talent pool there is right now, and the evolution of the 3 point shot. Players need to find team success or else they cannot guarantee themselves as an All Star Lock.",nbadiscussion

1133,138,"Happy 86th birthday, Bill Russell! No one did more to ensure his team’s success & win championships. He won 11 NBA titles, 2 NCAA titles, and Olympic gold with his elite defense, rebounding, athleticism, versatility, passing, leadership, intelligence, clutch games…","Some items:

* Russell was 21-0 in winner-take-all games in his NBA career. No one else was close to that mark. If the Celtics & an opponent were even throughout a series & Bill Russell was playing, Boston was ALWAYS going to pull it out in the end. 

* The Celtics were ho-hum right before Russell joined the team, terrible right after he left, and even worse when he was on the team but missed games (*which wasn’t often*), but when he was there they were the most dominant title-winning team in sports history which proves how ludicrous the “He was simply the best player on a loaded team” comment is. When he missed games during his career, the Celtics had a losing record (*10-18, and 18 of those 28 missed games were against teams with losing records*). When Russell missed 3 or more games in a row --so his teammates really had to adjust & couldn’t just “get up” for one game without their leader-- the Celtics were 1-12. They were horrible without him. There is *NO* evidence the Celtics were any good when Russell wasn’t on the floor, rather a ton of evidence to the contrary. 

* Similarly, the Celtics didn’t win the title only 2 times during Russell’s 13-year career, and both were (probably) due to difficulties experienced by Russell. In 1958, the Hawks topped Boston 4-2 in the Finals (*winning by 2, 3, 2, & 1 points*), during which Russell missed 2 games & played hurt when he was available in the series. It’s safe to say Boston would have won that title with a healthy Russell. In 1967, the aging Celtics, fresh off of 8 straight championships, lost to the loaded & younger Sixers in the ECF. This was the first year Russell was Boston’s player-coach, which is significant since he faced horrendously stressful & over-the-top racism as the first black coach in US pro sports history, and he played so much & so intensely he often forgot to sub players which hurt his team. The next season, the Celtics were older & considered “done”, but he added a bench coach to handle subs, and they topped the defending & favored champion Sixers in the playoffs, and then won the title. Then the “seriously, they’re done now” 1968-69 Celtics clawed their way into the Finals & beat the LOADED Lakers 4-3 in Russell’s final season. Two giant asterisks have to go on the only two championships Boston *didn’t* win during Russell’s career. 

* Russell’s list of clutch games, series, and moments is ridiculous, but I’ll only point out he had [the greatest Game 7 performance of all-time in the 1962 Finals](https://old.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/bei34r/on_this_date_april_18_1962_bill_russell_had_the/), scoring 30 points & grabbing 40 rebounds to win the title in a super-tight Game 7. 

* Part of what made Russell so unbelievable in big games & moments (especially late in the games), was that his IQ and level of manipulating opponents is unparalleled historically. On defense, he’d often intentionally “just miss” blocking a particular star player’s shots earlier in a contest, but late in the game when the opponent was lulled into thinking they could get a certain shot off over Russell that night, he’d extend the extra inch and come up with clutch blocks & defensive plays they weren't expecting. I’ve never heard of another player doing stuff like this. Add in his truly Olympic-level athleticism (*[7th ranked high jumper in the world in 1956](https://trackandfieldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/14-mHJRank.pdf)*), and his defense was a cross between Tim Duncan & Kevin Garnett -- covering everything everywhere with incredible explosiveness, plus impeccable timing & decision-making.

* There is no hyperbole in saying Russell was *unquestionably* the most impactful defensive player ever. I feel like I’d be insulting the intelligence of knowledgeable fans by explaining this any further. 

* Russell is one of very few superstars who had an overwhelming positive & unifying force on his team in a way that had significant on-the-court value far beyond normal quantifiable skills/stats (*i.e. dictating the culture & how it affected the team’s play, creating the ultimate synergy*). In that category I put Bill Russell, Jerry West, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson (*from ‘86-91*), Tim Duncan, Steve Nash, and Stephen Curry. Lots of other star players had an impact on winning and were good leaders, but often didn’t have that contagious alpha-but-not-asshole power to keep everything in one positive direction (*ex: Dr. J and David Robinson*).

* The stories about his IQ are legendary & numerous - [here are some clips about his hoops IQ](https://old.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/e5pplu/imo_bill_russell_had_one_of_the_highest_bbiqs_ever/). At least watch the 3rd one on that list (""Some more mindgames"") to see a short interview with him talking about manipulation of a star opponent in a way I’ve never heard another player articulate; he truly was thinking on a whole different level to create advantages for his team. 

* Bill Russell was so versatile on the floor, he would train & [play all 5 positions on offense](https://old.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/bozife/bill_russell_ran_all_5_positions_on_offense_for/). The only other players in history who could *maybe* do this are Maurice Stokes & Giannis Antetokounmpo, but Russell’s results were quite different, plus immediate & sustained. His value to the Celtics’ offense is WAY underrated, especially [on the fast break](https://old.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/bfh9f2/bill_russell_leading_finishing_fast_breaks_are/) where he had a bigger influence than Steve Nash due to how well he could start, run, and finish it. 

* Speaking of which, Bill Russell was an *elite* passer, both in the half-court & full-court, and put up [insane passing numbers for a center, especially in the playoffs](https://old.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/bx42hh/big_men_c_or_pf_who_were_great_passers_so_much_so/). John Havlicek talked about how much worse the Celtics’ offense was right after Russell’s retirement due to his missing passing.

* Russell lead an *unranked* San Francisco University team to 2 consecutive NCAA titles, and [could have won a title all 3 seasons he played at SFU](https://old.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/dddwse/bill_russell_won_2_titles_in_college_but_actually/) if not for an injury to his HOF PG teammate, KC Jones. Even at the college level, he could lead players who weren’t supposed to win to the ultimate heights; it wasn’t just in Boston. And he was the leading scorer, rebounder, & defender on the 1956 gold medal winning Olympic team, which had an average margin of victory of +53, the highest ever (*’92 Dream Team was +44*). 

* Fans often knock him for not being a high scorer. He played on a team that spread around the scoring so very few Celtics ever had big scoring numbers, and he often had the best FG% on the team, with a career FG% that was higher than the league’s by the same ratio as Hakeem over the NBA’s during his career (*Russell finished top-5 in FG% 4x, way better than Hakeem who was considered unstoppable*). Russell understood what sacrifices to make so the Celtics would be winners, which is why he won the 1962 MVP ([voting](https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_1962.html)) over Wilt Chamberlain (*his epic 50 ppg & 26 rpg season*) and Oscar Robertson (*his epic triple-double season*). **It was clear that Russell’s approach was far more valuable to his team’s success than that of other superstars with monster stats.**",nbadiscussion

1135,140,How many players do you think have a legit GOAT argument? I’ll give you mine.,"The NBA GOAT debate is the age-old question but it's just beating a dead horse at this point. So, I’m saying who do you think has a legit argument to be the GOAT? Here are mine:

Jordan- 6/6 Finals, highest PPG ever, 2x more FMVP'S than anybody else, best perimeter defender ever, majority considered the GOAT. 

Kareem- Most points ever, 6 rings, 6 MVPs, was all-NBA caliber for almost 20 tears. 

LeBron- widely regarded as the best passing non-PG ever, 8 straight Finals appearances, 3 rings in 9 appearances, longevity is nearly getting to Kareem’s level. 

Russell- 11 rings, in my opinion the best defender ever, best winner in sports history. 

Those are my 4 no-brainers. The weird thing about this argument is that it’s not in order of best players, at least for me. For instance, I think Magic is the 4th best player ever, but he’s not on this list. Here we’ll get into my next tier that I’m on the fence about maybe having a legit GOAT argument:

Wilt: best statistical peak ever, averaged 50 points and 26 rebounds in a season, however, historically slowed down in the postseason and only won 2 rings. 

Shaq: he or wilt are considered as the most dominant player ever, in my opinion best finals series ever in 2000 (38 and 17, FMVP, win in 6), 4 rings (3-peat from 2000-02), led the league in FG% 10 times. 

You guys probably have beef with me for not including Kobe, Magic, Duncan, and Bird in this list. But honestly, I don't think they have a legit GOAT argument. Comment if you disagree!",nbadiscussion

1139,144,Recent story of Omari Spellman's weight issues during the NBA season make me question the handling of developing young players as permanent/consistent members of the active roster,"There recently was a story published by [Warriors Wire](https://warriorswire.usatoday.com/2019/07/13/omari-spellman-struggles-with-weight/), drawing from an interview/piece from [the Athletic](https://theathletic.com/773580/2019/01/18/how-hawks-spellman-lost-control-of-his-weight-and-realized-he-needed-a-change/) about Omari Spellman and his issues with keeping his weight down during the NBA season. Here's an excerpt:

>But what quickened Spellman’s weight gain was inactivity — yes, even during an NBA season.

>In the pros, the practices are shorter than in college and Spellman saw a drastic reduction to his playing time. In 2017-18 at Villanova, Spellman averaged 28 minutes per game but saw that number fall to 17 minutes as a Hawk.

>Plus, constant air travel means constant sitting; jet lag, time zone changes and sleep deprivation are known to wreck the metabolism.

This story got me thinking...young NBA players have challenges on the road, as mentioned above. Teams often prioritize their role as a traveling member (often in name only, as they may not play much) of the team over their personal development.

My next thought is of Dragan Bender, a player who recently signed with my Bucks. Bender, to my knowledge, always traveled with the Suns, and played 82 games his sophomore season (when he was 19/20 years old). Bender at the time was far too weak and skinny to play a big man's role, and was lacking in his skills as well. Furthermore, he was on a team that had zero playoff hopes past the first week of the season. Why was he with the team the entire season, spending all that time sitting on planes/buses, getting inconsistent sleep, and in unfamiliar workout environments when he could have periodically missed road trips to do rigid and scheduled weightlifting, practicing, and more in Phoenix? Playing in games is valuable to improvement, but there's diminishing returns over a whole 82 games. 

Bringing this conversation full-circle, I believe there's a lot of players (I felt this way about Thon at a time) who could benefit from being treated as ""part-time"" roster players while they're very young and have serious work to do on their body and skills in the gym/practice facility, rather than being on the road and present for every game of a season that's nearly 3x as long as what they did in college with just one serious break (All-Star). Spellman appears to be one example of a player whose personal development was hurt by participating in the NBA travel and game schedule as a young player still building himself, and I don't think he's alone.",nbadiscussion

1141,146,A look at John Stockton's historical records which are probably never going to be broken,"Today is the birthday of an NBA icon, in the full sense of that word. John Stockton was born on 26.03.1962. and spent his entire career as a Utah Jazz PG. He has taken the team to the playoffs every season of his career.

But unfortunately, Stockton and Malone failed to take Utah to the very end, they failed to bring down those famous Chicago Bulls in 97th and 98th, the Houston Rockets a few years before, and so on, and so on ... The list just goes on.

And that's a big pity because surely Stockton is one of the best PGs of all time and Malone one of the best PFs. And in my opinion, the two of them together are the best duo ever. Their Pick and Roll was unstoppable.

Stockton himself was simply a genius, the Point Guard any coach could wish for. The man had over 1000 assists a season 7 times, and from 87-88 to 96-97 had over 10 assists per game. He still holds the record for 14.5 assists per game in a single season. In addition, Stockton is, of course, the all-time leader in NBA history with 15806 assists, while the second-placed Jason Kidd has ""only"" 12091, almost 4000 assists less ... A record that will most likely never be reached.

But that's not all, Stockton was known for being a fierce defensive fighter, nimble and bold and often very dirty, often topping everyone's list of the most annoying player you could meet on the court. This is evidenced by the fact that Stockton is the all-time leader in the NBA in the number of steals with 3265 steals.

I made some graphs about it. The [first one](https://i.imgur.com/OTNH2B7.png) shows you how far he really is in the previous two statistics from the other players, the distance is quite large between him and Jason Kidd, and after that from everyone else.

And that was all possible because Stockton played as many as 19 seasons in which he missed only 22 games. 22. There was no rest for him.

The following two graphs that you can see show [assists over time](https://i.imgur.com/ueb00wQ.png) (depending on the number of matches) and [steals over time](https://i.imgur.com/HUdSDXM.png). And if we take away 4 full seasons (328 games), he would still lead in front of Kidd in assists and in steals. In the assists' segment, he would still lead for at least 1,000 assists.

My education in statistics is limited to a few research classes in graduate school, so I'm interested to hear if I'm misinterpreting this. I know there is a lot of nuance to quantifying NBA games because they're so dynamic. 

Note: Due to trailing late in several games, the Nuggets committed numerous intentional fouls. By virtue of that, I think this aggregate stat actually slightly overestimates the number of game flow foul calls that benefited Los Angeles.",nbadiscussion
1144,149,Ja and Zion’s rookie campaign draw some interesting parallels to a previous season this decade.,"In 2013, Damian Lillard entered history as the winner of the annual ROTY award, and in doing so became only the fourth player in NBA history to win the award unanimously. Dame joined company of Ralph Sampson, David Robinson and Blake Griffin as he was the freshman who impressed voters the most in the 2012-13 season.

Lillard, in his inauguration as the Blazers’ point guard, averaged a cool stat line of 19/3.1/6.5 with complimentary shooting splits of .43/.37/.84. Through his rookie year, Dame was consistency personified as he and Kyle Singler were the only rookies to feature in every game.

However it must be noted that the ex- Weber State point guard wasn’t the general consensus pick for the award.

In New Orleans, the Hornets had just jumped the lottery to fleece the Cavaliers, Wizards and legendary 7-win Charlotte Bobcats from the premier pick in the 2012 draft, and in doing so were able to select the most highly coveted draft prospect since LeBron James was sent to Cleveland in 2003. With the first pick in the draft, New Orleans selected the 19-year old power forward Anthony Davis from Kentucky. 

Davis was raw but impressive in his first year in New Orleans, averaging 13/8/5 on a minutes restriction after having slight injury trouble through his rookie campaign.

Here’s where things get interesting. 

The 2020 ROTY “race” is again, and award almost set in stone. 

Ja Morant’s scintillating season as the point guard for the Memphis Grizzlies has been nothing short of breathtaking. As I’m writing this, Morant is leading the Grizz’ to a record on the right side of the .500 line, as the defiant Tennessee basketball club continue to defy expectations and continue on their warpath of the Western Conference, having beaten contenders Denver, Houston and LAC by a margin of 34 in the month of January alone. 

Leading the upstart Grizzlies, Ja is averaging 17.6/3.5/7.0 on shooting splits of 50/38/78, not to dissimilar to Dame’s rookie numbers. Ja is battling post subject Damian Lillard’s Blazers and co-Rookie Zion Williamson’s Pelicans for the 8th seed and what’s looking like a shot against, you guessed it, AD in the first round of the 2020 playoffs.

Last year, New Orleans once again jumped the lottery with this time the 7th worst overall record landing them the prized pick at the Barclays Center, once again leapfrogging the Cavs and Wizards in the process (sorry guys). With the first pick in the draft, New Orleans once again managed to select the most coveted draft prospect since LeBron James, as 19-year old power forward Zion Williamson became the newest star four at the Pels’ disposal.

Zion, akin to AD. has stuggled with injury through his rookie season, but has shone when asked, and is averaging an astounding 21/7/2 on a minutes restriction, with performances which have shown his scary potential in the future of the league. 

Grizzly fans and Pelicans fans should no doubt feel a tingle of excitement whilst reading this post, as following in these two players’ trajectories will almost certainly lead to a fruitful future for their respective teams and countless moments of brilliance from their star-men, unless the Pelicans fail to fly high with their second generational big-man talent, as their name might suggest.",nbadiscussion
1145,150,The Clippers amazing two year rebuild: A summary.,"Now that the shock has worn off, let’s talk about how the clippers went from losing Chris Paul and Blake Griffin to where they are today, all in the span of exactly two years.

First, they managed to get the Rockets to give them Pat Beverley, Montrezl Harrell, Lou Williams and a first round pick in a sign and trade so that CP3 could get his max contract. They later used that pick to get Danilo Gallinari.

Then, they dealt Blake Griffin to Detroit for Tobias Harris, Boban, Avery Bradley and a first rounder. That first round pick was used in the trade for Shai Gilgeous where they ended up giving Charlotte 2 second rounders to swap spots.

Then, a few months ago, they traded Harris to Philly for a package that included Landry Shamet and two first rounders, one of them being the coveted Miami pick.

Finally, a few days ago, they were able to get Mo Harkless and another first rounder from Miami just for absorbing the Harkless contract.

A few other things worth mentioning.

The Clippers were in constant asset collection mode, always winning small moves here and there and adding quality depth. That depth was on display last year when they managed to make the playoffs in the West even after trading Harris and despite having zero stars. They built the kind of quality depth that might appeal to, oh I don’t know, a superstar free agent who might be looking for a new team. I don’t know how many times we’ve seen teams in recent years (namely the Lakers and Knicks) constantly gave away assets for cap space to sign free agents, only to strike out on said free agents. Why would anyone think that an empty roster is attractive to superstar free agents that can have their pick of what team to go to? 

Also, In the last two years, they’ve been a .500 team. The FO made the decision not to tank, but to be competitive and try to rebuild on the fly. So not only did they turn this thing around in two years, they did it without any high lottery picks. 

Which brings us to yesterday.

In the span of two years, the Clippers did such a good job collecting assets and “winning trades” that they had enough in the barrel to not only pay what they did to get PG, but have a solid supporting cast left over. Harrell, Lou and Beverley were the heart and soul of last years playoff team. Landry Shamet is a high level sharpshooter and just an awesome fit next to the guys they have. They are going to be able to start three of the best defenders in the league, then bring Harrell and Lou in to play against the opposing bench.  

They have Jerome Robinson and Kabengele, two young first rounders that can either be bench pieces or trade chips. They have depth and they’ll add more cheap veterans in the next few weeks. Guys are wanna come here and ring chase.

I hope, with all the stuff about Kawhi pulling a power move and hijacking PG, that the bigger lesson isn’t lost on people. As was the case in Brooklyn, the winner of these free agency sweepstakes were teams with good geography and a strong front office. Everyone had NY and LAL as the favorites and they ended up losing out to better run franchises in the same city.

And before I go, a word on the Clipper from office. I love Jerry West to death and he’s arguably the best NBA GM of all time, but I question the wisdom of crediting him for what the Clippers have done here. One of the many brilliant things Ballmer did was bring in a lot of talented guys to run his team, because he has god money and he understands how to run a business. Lawrence Frank and Michael Winger have great reputations around the league, and they’ve built a deep staff. Even Jerry West himself has said that he’s just a consultant and that those guys deserve the credit for the Clippers turnaround. Maybe we should take him at his word instead of breathlessly speculating that is just has to be all Jerry’s doing?",nbadiscussion

1147,152,Salary cap magic: How the Nets created $9.2m out of thin air to sign DeAndre Jordan,"There's been a lot of talk about DeAndre Jordan's contract being an overpay at 4 yrs/$40m, and the argument against that has been that he is basically coming free since it was believed that Kyrie and KD were taking less money for him to be signed. In reality, what the Nets have done to accommodate his contract - as well as their previous players DLo, Graham, and Napier - is even more impressive. I also posted this in the Nets subreddit but I think it's so interesting it's worth sharing here as well.

I take no credit for this information - the following chunk of text is a series of tweets by @AlbertNahmad on Twitter, a salary cap enthusiast. He breaks down the incredible salary cap wizardry the Nets will be performing to sign all of their new players without having to trade anyone AND with Kyrie and KD getting virtually all of their max contract money as well. This is incredible stuff.

> Follow the next set of tweets very closely, to see how the Brooklyn Nets will employ salary cap magic on July 6, to squeeze an extra $9.2 million out of thin air!
> 
> The common logic across the NBA community is the Nets did the Warriors a favor by agreeing to take in Kevin Durant via sign-and-trade, vs. simply signing him outright… That’s only half true! Yes, GSW extracted something: D’Angelo Russell. But so did Brooklyn: DeAndre Jordan!
> 
> The Nets were probably planning to sign Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving into cap room. But when DeAndre Jordan became a possibility, they probably then shifted course. They decided to steal the Lakers’ idea!
> 
> The Nets will brilliantly sequence their transactions, in order to increase the combined salary they can give to Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and DeAndre Jordan by a whopping $9.2M… effectively creating cap room out of thin air to cover Jordan’s entire first-year salary!!!
> 
> OK, so how are the Nets going to do it? Here are the steps:
> 
> The Nets will first exhaust all $68.8M of their cap room by signing their free agents and draft picks. They’ll sign D’Angelo Russell, DeAndre Jordan, Nicolas Claxton, and, finally, Kyrie Irving (who will need to take a small discount from his $32.7M max – as little as $420K).
> 
>Think about what just happened… The Nets need $70.0M cap room just to sign Durant ($38.2M) and Irving ($32.7M), let alone add Jordan ($9.3M). They can only create $68.8M, by waiving Napier and Graham (NGs). Instead, they’ll keep Napier, Graham and Russell to exhaust cap room.
> 
>The Nets will then guarantee $3.2M of the combined $3.5M salaries of Shabazz Napier and Treveon Graham, so they’ll count as outgoing salary in trade. They’ll then combine Napier, Graham and D’Angelo Russell to trade-match for… Kevin Durant (who could get his full $38.2M max).
> 
>The Nets will end it all $8.3M over the salary cap – having artificially created $9.2M in cap room by exceeding the salary cap to trade-match for Kevin Durant, rather than sign him outright. And they’ll give that extra money to… DeAndre Jordan!
> 
>And that’s why the Warriors will need to acquire Shabazz Napier and Treveon Graham in the D’Angelo Russell trade, even though their salaries were non-guaranteed. And it’s also why they’ll need to pay the Wolves cash just to get rid of them!
> 
>For those asking: If you follow my tweets closely, you will notice that the Nets will sign D’Angelo Russell into cap room. So BYC will NOT apply. That is the most critical part of this entire story!
> 
>Kevin Durant doesn’t necessarily need to take anything below his $38.2M max to make the math work. Kyrie Irving might need to take as little as $420K less than his $32.7M max. But if he really wants that $420K, he can take it as some sort of unlikely bonus (by signing first)!

This seriously blew my mind. I've been operating with the understanding that KD and Kyrie were both taking around $5m less to fit DJ's salary but the DLo S&T is actually making all of this work for the Nets, while they're also getting a 1st round pick from the Warriors and guaranteeing money for all of these players - including their boys Treveon Graham and Napier.

However, this season on the Clippers, he seems to have fell off. He plays around 7 less minutes a game, around the 28 min average. He also barely scores 20 a night, which also is an 8 point stepdown.

1151,156,[OC] Introducing Playoff Success Shares : quantifying contextualised playoff success (the end of the Rings Erneh argument ?),"# The concept :

**SKIP TO PSS RESULTS IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT HOW THE NUMBERS ARE CALCULATED**

A couple of you might remember this stat from the first post about it, back in the distant year of 2017, but for the rest :

As far as resumes go, there aren’t many objective ways of ranking individually attributable playoff success. We all agree “best player on a championship team” is the best, but what about comparing different guys who achieved that ? This guy had better teammates, but that guy played in an easier conference. How about being the best player on a conference finalist ? Is that better than being no2 on a title team ? Well, it depends on a player’s individual performance, it depends on how good the player’s teammates are, and it depends on how tough the competition was.

So I looked for a way of quantifying the amount of team playoff success a player is individually responsible for, contextualised for teammate level, strength of competition and team performance.

The essential idea is this : first, we figure out how much contextualised success every playoff team in NBA history has had.

Second, we figure out, for each playoff team, how much (percentage wise) each individual player on that team was individually responsible for.

Finally, we multiply the two to come up with the player’s individual number, called Playoff Success Shares, or PSS. So, we can calculate this for every season, every playoff team, every player. Here’s how it works :




----

# The method :

So, how do we come up with a single number to define a team’s playoff success ? Here are the problems :

First off, it seems completely subjective to decide how much PSS a team would get based solely on which round of the playoffs they reached.

Secondly, it seems somewhat unfair, since a team doesn’t necessarily deserve more credit just going further. For example the Kings in 2002 pushed the Lakers to 7 in the WCF compared to the clearly weaker 2002 Nets who got swept by those same Lakers.  It just didn’t sit right with me that the Nets would get to split more Shares between them just because they happened to be in the weaker conference and thus reached the Finals instead of “only” making the WCF.

## So here’s what I came up with :

At the end of the regular season, all playoff teams are assigned a value (**Regular Season Value**), meant to represent how good they were, based on win percentage and simple-rating-system. SRS allows to account for strength of competition (showing that just because the ’16 Raptors won more games than the ’16 Thunder, they weren’t a better team), and win percentage is a good equalizer to avoid things like one team having negative value or one team having a value 4000 times greater than another. 

The average team ( .500 record, 0 SRS) would have a Regular Season Value of 50. 

The very best regular season teams ever have a value approaching 200 (206 for the ’96 Bulls, 201 for the ’72 Lakers and 200 for the ’71 Bucks are the only teams to pass 200).

Teams then accumulate **Playoff Value** (PV), based on their opponents and their performance.

For the first round, the losing team accumulates more Playoff Value the closer the series was (pushing it to 7 gains more Playoff Value than getting swept), and the exact amount of Playoff Value they gain is proportional to the Regular Season Value of the team they lost to, assuming they won games. 

To give you a bit of an idea of the numbers, here’s how much Playoff Value (PV) a team would add in a first round loss against the ’16 Warriors or ’07 Nets :

Result | ’16 GSW | ’07 NJN
:-:|:-:|:-:
Loss in 4 | 50.0 PV | 50.0 PV
Loss in 5 | 69.3 PV | 54.0 PV
Loss in 6 | 88.6 PV | 58.0 PV
Loss in 7 | 107.8 PV | 62.0 PV

For the winning team, it’s the opposite. The fewer games they drop, the more value they gain.

From the 2nd round onwards, the calculations remain the same except instead of using only the opponents’ Regular Season Value, the already accumulated Playoff Value is taken into account as well. The idea being that some teams play better in the playoffs, and therefore teams “inherit” a part of the value of their opponents as the rounds go on. 

The ’16 Thunder were tough to beat not just because they were the 55-win Thunder, but also because they were the team that beat the 67-win Spurs.

For example, eliminating the ’07 Warriors gained the Jazz a decent amount of Playoff Value that round because they weren’t just the ’07 Warriors, they were also the team that beat the ’07 Mavs. For this exact example, the ’07 Jazz added 115.4 Playoff Value in the 2nd round by beating the Warriors in 5, but if just the Regular Season Value was taken into account, they would only have added 53.6 Playoff Value in that second round. This is of course one of the most extreme examples.

The Playoff Value gained during each round is then added together for a total Playoff Value, meant to represent how much a team’s playoff run was worth, once strength of competition, and performance against said competition, are accounted for. 

Although not statistically an obligation in this model, the winning team has always had the most Playoff Value every year by a big stretch (due to more Playoff Value being up for grabs the further the round).

## Playoff Value results :

Since 2000, the highest Playoff Values are the ’01 Lakers (15-1 record, 4 straight 50-win teams) at 866.7 (the highest ever), the ’11 Mavs (pretty good playoff record, really tough competition) at 833.1 and the ’16 Cavs (for having beaten the super-Warriors) at 826.3 (464.0 of which was accumulated in the Finals alone).

However, this model is unfair to teams that are better in the regular season.

For example, in 2016, the Spurs swept the first round and lost the 2nd round in 6. The Blazers won the 1st round in 6, and then lost in 5. Yet the Blazers accumulated more Playoff Value simply by virtue of playing tougher competition.

This seems unfair as the Blazers didn’t play tougher competition because they played in a more competitive era or conference, it was merely because they weren’t good enough to secure a high seed in the regular season.

Thus, the Regular Season Value is added to the Playoff Value. Important to stress, this is NOT because this metric aims to take into account regular season performance directly, but simply for recognising the importance of the regular season in making the playoffs and securing a high seed (thus making the road to the title easier).

That being said, this is still a playoff stat, so the Regular Season Value isn’t a huge difference (on most title teams, the Regular Season Value is about 135, while the Playoff Value is over 700), and mostly impacts teams that lose in early rounds.

The exact calculations are adjusted so as not to penalise teams that played when the 1st round was best-of-5, or when the first round was a bye for the top seeds, etc ...

## Total Value results 

Since 2000, the highest Total Values are still the ’01 Lakers (972.2), however the ’16 Cavs (953.4) leapfrog the ’11 Mavs (946.4) because they were better in the regular season (remember, it’s not about rewarding good play in the regular season as much as it is not punishing teams that avoided tough competition in the playoffs by being great in the regular season), and the ’17 Warriors join the mix in 3rd place with a 952.1.

The lowest Total Values by title teams since 2000 are the ’13 Heat (784.7), ’04 Pistons (785.1) and ’20 Lakers (786.2).

The highest Total Values by Finals losing teams since 2000 are the ’08 Lakers (766.5, highest mark ever, almost as much as some title teams), the ’13 Spurs (701.8) and the ’16 Warriors (681.1).

The model also confirms what common sense indicated : the 2002 Kings had a 491.5 Total Value (2nd highest for a team that lost in the conference Finals ever) while the ’02 Nets had a 429.8 Total Value (lowest for a Finals loser so far this century).

The model also roughly confirms what many experts believe : basketball got a lot better really quickly from the 60s to the 90s, and has roughly stagnated since (maybe a better way to word this would be that great teams had easier paths to the title in the 60s. It's not a measure of the actual level of play on the court).

Average Total Value for the title team by decade, as well the highest Total Value for a team that decade :

2010s : 889.6 (so far) , ’16 Cavs (953.4)

2000s : 876.9, ’01 Lakers (972.2)

1990s : 916.7, ’97 Bulls (1057.3, all-time best mark)

1980s : 785.4, ’89 Pistons (951.7)

1970s : 692.7, ’72 Lakers (877.8)

1960s : 570.4, ’69 Celtics (701.6)

1950s  (’50 and ’51 not included) : 440.4, ’53 Lakers (544.6)

Each playoff team’s total value is then divided by the same number, calculated so that the average number of PSS a title team receives is 5.00, which is seems arbitrary but means the average starter on an average title team with no bench should receive 1.00 PSS for 1 ring.

The highest (’97 Bulls) received 6.91 PSS as a team, the lowest title team (’57 Celtics) received 2.42 PSS.

If enough people are interested, I’ll make a post just about team Value and which were the best playoff runs ever ranked by this metric, where I go more into detail on the adjustments for the different playoff formats that have existed over the course of the NBA since ’52 (10 different formats in that timeframe).

Notes on Total Value :

- A few obvious flaws : there is still some subjectivity to the model (deciding the factor in front of the formula that adjusts for competition level and length of series, which increases each round) and the model assumes an opponent is as good during a series as it was before the series, which is wrong if a team chokes or, more likely, suffers from injuries to one/some of its best player(s) and finally the model benefits teams from the 50s/60s by considering a loss in the 1st round (which was also the conference semis at the time) equivalent to losing in the conference semis nowadays, instead of considering it the equivalent of losing in the 1st round (not that impactful of a decision considering the teams from those decades still accumulated very low numbers of Total Value). 

- Even incorporating the “inheriting value” factor, teams with mediocre regular seasons than massively overperform in the playoffs still aren’t considered amazing opponents to beat. Most glaring example is the 2017 Warriors “only” accumulating 294.9 PV in the Finals because as amazing as the Cavs were in the playoffs, they were still just a 51-win team with a meh 2.87 SRS.

- The ’73 Knicks (869.4) and ’72 Lakers (877.8) are the complete outliers of the pre-merger era, with more than 160 Total Value more than any other team of that era (’52-’76). There was only one other team before the ’76 merger that even cracked 700 (’69 Celtics at 701.6).

- 1989 was a true tipping point. The ’89 Pistons were the first team to crack 900. Before them, only 5 teams had reached 800 (’72 Lakers, ’73 Knicks, ’80 Lakers, ’83 Sixers and ’86 Celtics, which is 5/37 champs from ’52 to ’88),  but since ’89, every title team has cracked 800 except the ’04 Pistons, ’20 Lakers and ’13 Heat (which is 29/32 champs from ’89 to ’16) and almost half have reached 900+ (15/32).

- Unsurprisingly, since 2000, the losing WCF team had a higher Total Value than the losing ECF team all but three years (’09, ’19 and ’20).

- No losing Finals team has ever had more Total Value than the champions.

- Rarely has a Conference Finals losing team had more Total Value than the Finals losing team, but it has happened a few times (’02 Kings (491.5) over Nets (429.8), ’81 Sixers (467.9) over Rockets (424.5) and ’72 Bucks (396.4) over Knicks (387.5))

- Top 5 Highest Total Value for teams that didn’t win the title : ’08 Lakers (766.5), '13 Spurs (701.8), ’98 Jazz (694.0), ’91 Lakers (689.8) and ’16 Warriors (681.1).

#PSS

The team PSS is then split between the players on a team using various advanced stats.

4 Advanced stats are used to determine credit :

- Playoff VORP : VORP is good because it’s already cumulative, and because it’s a box-score derived metric. This makes it less accurate but also calculable going as far back as 1974. More accurate stats like RPM or RPM wins don’t go nearly as far back, so are useless for historic comparisons.

- Playoff Win Shares : same advantages, already cumulative and calculable going all the way back to 1955. 

- Cumulative Playoff PER : PER is the most flawed of these but presents the advantage of being a good equalizer. VORP and WS can be negative or close to 0 so using only those would give a huge boost to the superstar level players and the role players would get very little credit (and by that I mean basically none), so the metric would lose all purpose as it would become synonymous with the “Finals MVPs” approach discussed earlier. PER is multiplied by minutes played to get “cumulative PER” since a player posting a 43 PER who played 5 minutes over the entire playoffs should not be getting too much credit for a title. The assumption is made that a team's pace doesn't vary much from lineup to lineup (less than 10 possessions per 48 minutes difference)

- Cumulative last series GameScore : Now I know I said the whole point of this was to stop players being judged only by rings or Finals MVPs, but I do believe that the players that stepped up in the last round a team reached should get a bigger chunk of the credit than a teammate that contributed just as much overall but mostly contributed in the first 3 rounds. The formula is simply the sum of the player’s GameScore for each game they played in the Finals. (for example, without this factor, Kobe gets more credit for 2001 than Shaq).

Finally all are added up with weights designed to give equal importance to each metric. 

The weights are 1 for PER x MP, 5 000 for WS, 12 000 for VORP and a variable weight for series GameScore that varies from 150 for a 7 game Finals to 263 for a Finals sweep (the point being that just because a Finals was shorter shouldn’t mean that the Finals GameScore factor should count less) 

These weights were chosen so that the team totals in each category would be roughly equal.

Example for the 2016 Cavs : 

sum of players’ PER x MP : 88472

sum of players’ WS x 5000 : 86000

sum of players’ VORP x 12000 : 87600

sum of players’ Cumulative Finals GmSc x 150 : 80820

Finally each player’s total “score” is divided by the team’s total “score”, given a number that can be interpreted as the % of the credit that player deserves for that title run. This percentage is multiplied by the total PSS the team received to give 

An example of what this means :

All the 2014 Spurs got a ring, and Kawhi got a Finals MVP. Nobody else got anything.

On paper :

Kawhi : 1 ring, 1 Finals MVP

Duncan : 1 ring, 0 Finals MVP

Austin Daye : 1 ring, 0 Finals MVP

LeBron : 0 rings, 0 Finals MVP

DeMarcus Cousins : 0 rings, 0 Finals MVP

So resume-wise, LeBron adds no more than Boogie (who missed the playoffs) and Duncan adds no more than Austin Daye.

But by PSS :

Kawhi : 0.96 PSS

Duncan : 0.90 PSS

Austin Daye : 0.002 PSS

LeBron : 1.13 PSS

Boogie : 0.00 PSS

## PSS Results 

**For those who skipped to here :** PSS is a measure of a player's contribution to a playoff team, with context of team performance, teammate level and strength of competition taken into account. How well a team does (and who they do it against) gives the team a total PSS, which is then split between the players on said team using advanced stats to determine who deserves how much of the team PSS.

For each decade, the first table represents how many PSS each notable player accumulated each year. Cells in green are for players that won a ring that year, in orange are those that lost in the Finals. All runs over 1PSS are bolded.

 The second represents each player’s career accumulated PSS year-by-year, color-scaled to highlight the best players (green) and the least productive among these examples (red). The players deemed “notable” enough to include in these tables are the big names of the decade/era in question, as well as a few key roles players (and every All-NBA 1st Team member, explaining DeAndre’s inclusion).

For all players with at least 5 or more career PSS, here’s a graph of how they stack up :

A whole bunch of notes and records and stuff :

- **THIS IS NOT A GOAT RANKING** These numbers are merely meant to replace the “Finals MVP” and “rings” lines in a players’ CV, not be a single metric that encapsulates a player’s entire resume.

- The players with multiple “Playoff MVPs” are : Russell (8), Jordan (7), LeBron (6), Shaq and Magic (4), Mikan, Kareem, Bird and Duncan (3), Wilt, Havlicek, Walt Frazier, Hakeem, Kobe and Curry (2).

- A good barometer seems to be 1 PSS = 1 good performance on a title team or 1 great performance on a non-title team, 1.5 PSS = 1 great performance on a title team and 2 PSS = 1 all-time great performance on a title team.

- LeBron is the all-time leader at 17.29 PSS, over Jordan (15.47). 

- Dolph Schayes had the most PSS over the ’50s decade (2.81), Russell over the ‘60s (8.19), Kareem over the ‘70s (5.62), Magic over the ’80s (9.80), Jordan over the ‘90s (12.91), Kobe over the ’00s (8.88) and LeBron over the ’10s (12.57) and ’20s so far (1.60).

- Kareem is also 3rd over the ‘80s, and is the only player to be top 3 in two different decades (not counting the ’20s yet). Ironically, he’s 1st of the ‘70s and 3rd of the ’80s despite accumulating more PSS in the ’80s than ’70s. 

- LeBron has the most runs of 1 or more PSS at 10, followed by Jordan (8), Kobe and Magic (6), Pippen (5), Shaq, Bird, Kareem and Duncan (4). LeBron holds the record for most consecutive years of 1+ PSS at 8 straight (his 8 straight Finals streak).

- Russell was the first player to reach 1PSS in a single season (’62), Kareem was the first to 1.5PSS (’80) and Jordan the first to 2PSS (’91).

- At least one player has reached 1 or more PSS every year since ’79.

- The only players to accumulate 1 or more PSS in a year in which their team didn’t win are Kareem, Dr. J, Bird, Magic, Drexler, Barkley, Jordan, Karl Malone, Payton, Shaq, Kobe, Dirk, Wade, Dwight, LeBron, KD, Steph and Jimmy Butler. Drexler, Jordan, Kobe and LeBron are the only ones to do so more than once. LeBron holds the record for most such playoff runs at 6 (nobody else has more than 2).

- LeBron and Jordan are the only 2 players to ever accumulate more than 1 PSS in a season in which their team didn’t reach the Finals (’09 and ’89/’90). Jordan is the only player to do so more than once, and is also the only player to ever lead the league in PSS in a year in which he didn’t reach the Finals (’89).

- The only players to lead the league in PSS in years in which they didn’t win the title are Kareem (’74), Jordan (’89), Shaq (’04), Kobe (’08) and LeBron (’14, ’18). LeBron’s the only one to do it twice.

- The only runs with more than 2 PSS are ’97 Jordan (2.10), ’00 Shaq (2.09), ’91 Jordan (2.05), ’93 Jordan (2.03) and ’16 LeBron (2.01). ’03 Duncan just misses the cut (1.997). Thus Jordan has more such runs than the rest of all players in NBA history combined. 

- The next best runs are ’03 Duncan (2.00), ’06 Wade (1.94), ’12 LeBron (1.94) and ’94 Hakeem (1.93).

- The highest PSS in a year with no ring is ’18 LeBron BY FAR (1.67), followed by ’91 Magic (1.43), ’08 Kobe (1.36) and ’06 Dirk (1.33).

- The best duos ever are ’97 Jordan/Pippen (3.48), ’91 Jordan/Pippen (3.33) and ’01 Shaq/Kobe (3.31). The only teams to feature two players over 1.5 PSS are the ’01 Lakers (Shaq and Kobe) and ’10 Lakers (Pau and Kobe). ’20 Lakers only just miss the cut (LeBron 1.60, AD 1.49).

- The ’92 Bulls are the only team to feature 3 players over 1PSS (Jordan, Pippen and Grant).

- 2009 is the only year that 4 different players had over 1PSS (Kobe, Pau, Dwight and LeBron).

- LeBron is the only player to have accumulated 5+ PSS for two different franchises.

- Kobe and Magic have every “most PSS through age X” record from age 18 to 29 (Magic has 7 of them, Kobe has the other 5). LeBron has the record for most PSS through age 30 and above.

- Magic, Bird and Duncan have every “most PSS through X years in the league” record from rookie year to 8th season. Jordan and Magic are neck and neck through 9 and 10 seasons, and Jordan has the record for most PSS through 11, 12, 13 and 14 years. LeBron has the most through the first 15 seasons, and onwards.

- The timeline of “most PSS ever” record looks like this : ’50-’58 Mikan, ’58-’61 Schayes, ’62-’83 Russell, ’84-’96 Kareem, ’97-’17 Jordan, ’18-now LeBron.

- 17 of the 39 players with 5 or more career PSS played for the Lakers or Celtics at some point in their career. The Celtics have 5 players to make the list who played exclusively for their franchise (Russell, Bird, Havlicek, McHale and Sam Jones) , the Spurs have 4 (Duncan, Robinson, Parker and Ginobili) and the Lakers “only” have 3 (Kobe, Magic and Jerry West) but two of them are in the top 7.

- Being based on box-score derived metrics, high-impact players who don’t show up much on the boxscore aren’t well represented (Rodman is the ultimate example of this).

- For the same reasons, high-volume low-efficiency scorers are also screwed by the model (Iverson gets only 0.84 PSS for ’01, and 2.70 for his career).

- Some players are higher than expected (Grant, Pippen, K. Malone, …), but it’s important to remember this metric doesn’t aim to represent the best playoff performers, but simply the ones with the most individually attributable playoff success, so it’s not insane that players with crazy longevity or that played on many great teams would show up high on these rankings.

- Since context is taken into account, the numbers are comparable directly to one another. It doesn’t make sense to say something like “Wilt had 8.99 PSS despite only winning twice” or “Russell has 9.55 PSS despite playing in a weak era”. The entire point is that that’s already taken into account. If Wilt had more help, he would have gotten further and his team would have accumulated more value, but he also would have gotten a smaller chunk of it. If Russell had played in a stronger era, he would have gotten more PSS for getting each ring, but he would have won fewer rings. The only context that could make sense to add is time (“Bird got 9.04 PSS despite only playing 9 full healthy seasons” for example is a logical observation).

----

##Possible improvements :

- Instead of calculating what percentage of his team’s success a player is responsible for and multiplying it by the team’s total PSS, it would be more accurate to do so for round by round. That would benefit the players that stepped up in the more valuable rounds. Right now, the Last Series GameScore factor advantages the players that step up in the last series played, but all previous rounds count equally. Problem is precise series-by-series stats aren’t available before ’73, and even after that, only GameScore is accessible for all playoff series. 

- Regular season may be more accurate if another factor was considered, maybe Elo rating ? 

- The Playoff Value calculation could be made more accurate. Some series are closer than the series score indicates, and for others it’s the opposite. I’m thinking including series point differential to the formula, but that would require going through a LOT more data. 

- The first two NBA seasons and BAA seasons cannot be used (barely any boxscore data available). However, ABA is calculable, so I might get around to doing that. Dr. J is already really high on the list off of his NBA career alone, so I wonder how high he could get if the ABA counted.

So, what do you guys think ? Do you like the logic of this model ? Do you see other flaws/ways to improve it ?",nbadiscussion
1152,157,"20th anniversary of the ban on hand checking unpopular opinion: Lebron would have actually benefited from hand checking/playing in the ""more physical"" era","I hear people argue all the time that he's lucky he plays today because the rules make his game easier. I'd argue that his offensive game might be hindered somewhat by those rules, but on aggregate he'd be much more dominant in that era.

Almost every team that has eliminated him in the postseason has run finesse, motion heavy, spread the floor offenses. Without the 3 point revolution as represented by the Warriors, or the Spurs mastery of ball movement, he might have won 3 more rings between 2014 and 2018. 

The point is, the blueprint to beat him has never been to outmuscle him. He's a better pure athlete than just about any wing you could throw at him. Yes, hand checks would slow him down somewhat. But IN RELATION to competition, it would have less of an effect. Also consider how much his own defense would benefit from being able to maul opponents. In his physical peak I honestly think hed be the best wing defender.",nbadiscussion
1153,158,Damian Lillard’s giant contract,"Feel like nobody really talks about this. Dame and Portland agreeing to 4 years $196M is HUGE, on average $49M a year.

Was this the right move? Even Steph Curry’s $201M contract is for 5 years, and we know GSW might have issues keeping Draymond. 

Dame is a superstar/ top 10 player IMO and he probably deserves the contract given his loyalty and contributions to Portland. And obviously from his perspective, get every dollar you can. But this contract pays him significantly more than even Steph, Lebron, Kawhi, etc. Will this end up preventing Portland from contending? How do they stay competitive and add more pieces?",nbadiscussion

As many people would know by know the Jazz have acquired Mike Conley from the Memphis Grizzlies and look set to be able to challenge for a high playoff seed in the West this coming season. A commonly known fact by most people too is that Conley has never made an all-star game and many people would argue he is the best player to never have made an all star team. With this the case it made me curious as to which 3 players in NBA history have played together in a season and had 0 all star appearances.  
  
Now I haven't done a whole lot of research but I think Utah look pretty good.  
  
- **Mike Conley** averaged 21/3/6 last season on 44/36/85 shooting splits. Conley at his best was also arguably the best player on three 50 win teams. He was an elite defender at the guard position and a solid all around player.  
  
- **Rudy Gobert** averaged 16/13/2 last season on 67/-/64 shooting splits. Gobert at his best was also arguably the best player on three 50 win teams and is also in the running for his second DPOY after his second all-NBA team appearance too.  
  
- **Donovan Mitchell** averaged 24/4/4 last season on 43/36/81 shooting splits. Mitchell is also only in just his second season and has already been the number one option on back to back top 5 seeded teams. Another fun fact is that Mitchell has the highest career scoring average of all 0 time all stars in NBA history.  
  
-----  
  
So what do you think? Is Utah's trio for the upcoming season the best in NBA history for a team with 0 all stars or is there a better group that I'm forgetting about?",nbadiscussion
1156,161,Am I being a dumbass or did the refs attempt to nudge the over-under at the end of Raptors-Sixers?,"*I posted this to r/nba and it was removed. I could sound like an absolute dumbass, but I want someone to actually read this and tell me if I’m overreacting or not.*

Disclaimer: this doesn't prove anything about game-fixing. But it does look awfully suspicious. Also, this isn't just unjustified whining — I tried to get as much evidence as I could, and hyperlinked every foul I reference so you can decide for yourself how justified the whistles were.  

&#x200B;

The Bovada over-under line for Sixers-Raptors Game 6 opened at 213.5, but was bet down to 211.5 by tipoff. 56 percent of money was still on the under. 

&#x200B;

At 4:47 in the 4th quarter, the score was Sixers 101 - Raptors 80. 181 total points, 31 points shy of the over. With both teams seemingly ready to slow the game down and the Raptors about to throw in the towel, there appeared to be no chance at hitting the over. 

&#x200B;

Over the next 58 seconds between 4:47 and a Sixers timeout at 3:49, the two teams combined to shoot 11 free throws (7 for Toronto and 4 for Philly). The fouls-only play by play for those 58 seconds looked like this: 

&#x200B;

1. Ben Simmons shoots 2 free throws [(4:47)](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0041800216&GameEventID=584&Season=2018-19&title=Green%20Personal%20Take%20Foul%20(P3.PN)%20(T.Washington))
2. Flagrant on Joel Embiid on the second free throw, Marc Gasol shoots 2 free throws [(4:47)](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0041800216&GameEventID=591&Season=2018-19&title=Embiid%20FLAGRANT.FOUL.TYPE1%20(P4.T2)%20(Z.Zarba))
3. Personal foul on Tobias Harris [(4:37)](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0041800216&GameEventID=596&Season=2018-19&title=Harris%20P.FOUL%20(P1.T3)%20(J.Goble))
4. Personal foul on Ben Simmons, Raptors enter the bonus [(4:34)](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0041800216&GameEventID=600&Season=2018-19&title=Simmons%20P.FOUL%20(P4.T4)%20(J.Goble))
5. Shooting foul on Tobias Harris, Kawhi Leonard shoots 2 free throws [(4:30)](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0041800216&GameEventID=602&Season=2018-19&title=Harris%20S.FOUL%20(P2.PN)%20(Z.Zarba))
6. Away-from-play foul on J.J. Redick, Danny Green shoots 1 free throw and the Raptors keep the ball [(4:04)](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0041800216&GameEventID=613&Season=2018-19&title=Redick%20AWAY.FROM.PLAY.FOUL%20(P5.PN)%20(Z.Zarba))
7. Shooting foul on Ben Simmons, Kawhi Leonard shoots 2 free throws [(4:03)](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0041800216&GameEventID=616&Season=2018-19&title=Simmons%20S.FOUL%20(P5.PN)%20(T.Washington))
8. Personal foul on Serge Ibaka. Sixers are in the bonus, so Jimmy Butler shoots 2 free throws [(3:49)](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0041800216&GameEventID=620&Season=2018-19&title=Ibaka%20P.FOUL%20(P6.PN)%20(J.Goble))

&#x200B;

All fouls are hyperlinked — you can decide for yourself how legitimate some of the calls were. The two teams had not shot 11 free throws combined in any of the first three quarters. They'd just done it in 58 *seconds.* 

&#x200B;

All of a sudden, with 3:33 left the Sixers call a timeout. Both teams sub in their deep benches. Over a 74-second span, the score had gone from 101-80 to 106-87. 12 points in only 74 seconds, or a point scored every 6 seconds. The total reached 193, within reach of the 211.5 over-under. It would take only 19 points over the next 3:33 of garbage time to hit the over-under — still a pretty large number, but doable thanks to a flurry of whistles. 

&#x200B;

Predictably, the garbage time defense was basically nonexistent. Both teams threw in a few threes and open layups — and the refs, although not quite so blatantly this time, nudged the odds a bit more with another six free throws in the final 3:33. 

&#x200B;

With 36 seconds to play, Toronto got a steal and a runout dunk to make the score Sixers 112 - Raptors 101. 213 points. Remember, the over-under was 211.5. Over the last 4:47 of the game, the Sixers and Raptors combined for 32 points and 19 free throws. According to Basketball Reference, there hadn't been a 32-point five-minute stretch in any of the first four games. 

&#x200B;

The two teams shot 36 free throws in the first 43:13 of the game, for a rate of about one free throw every 80 seconds. For the last 4:47, the two teams shot 19 free throws, for a rate of about one free throw every 15 seconds — and for that one 58-second stretch between 4:47 and 3:49, one free throw every six seconds. 

&#x200B;

Again, this doesn't prove anything for certain. But when the free throw rate more than **QUINTUPLES** in garbage time of a twenty-point game, two teams combine for their highest-scoring five minute stretch of the series, and the two teams just *barely* cover the over, it seems very suspicious. 

&#x200B;

**TL;DR: In garbage time over the last 4:47 of the Sixers-Raptors game — a stretch that began with Philly up 21 — the two teams shot 19 free throws, more than five times as many as expected, and the two teams combined for 32 points, the highest-scoring five minute stretch of the series. This allowed the teams to cover a 211.5 over-under spread with 213 total points. This isn't definitive proof of game fixing, but to me it's awful suspicious.**",nbadiscussion
1157,162,Dallas Mavericks cap wizardry,"quite a few people (of course especially Mavs fans) were wondering why the Mavs who were the team with the biggest cap space remaining (almost 23m) almost didnt use any of their cap space (only 7.7m so far for Seth Curry)

but after the Delon Wright signing or to name it correct sign&trade it becomes pretty clear what path they are going and its quite brilliant to be honest

&nbsp;

it seems like someone from the Mavericks front office read the post on r/nbadiscussion about how the Nets created about 10m cap space out of thin air

Mavs did basically they same but added an extra twist

remember the Harrison Barnes trade in february? they created a 23m trade exception with that trade but as some cap experts here know - if you use cap room you also void your remaining trade exceptions at the same time

so what is the situation right now? Mavs so far signed Curry using up around 8m of their 31m cap space and signed Boban Marjanovic with their room exception and also agreed to re-sign Porzingis/Kleber/Finney-Smith using their bird/early-bird rights

if they outright would have signed Delon Wright into cap space now they would be left with 14m in cap space (not to mention Grizzlies could and potentially would have matched that offer sheet since he is an RFA) BUT if they didnt sign any other free agents in the next days their cap space would have been away once Porzinigs etc offically re-signed - so what did they do?

they sign&traded Delon Wright into their Barnes (23m) trade exception - what did this change?

by using their trade exception Mavericks no longer acted as an cap room team but an over the cap team 

they signed Boban using their BAE, Curry using their MLE - so now they can re-sign Porzingis/Kleber/Finney-Smith AND still have 12m of the Barnes trade exceptions left which they can use throughout the whole season and which could become very valuable since the Mavs are the only team besides the Hawks (13m cap space) that can absorb bigger contracts without problem AND since there are so many teams looking to contend this year some will fail and be sellers and not buyers at the trade deadline and then the Mavs can get some picks or other valuable assets (or some buyers trade a contract into the Mavs trade exception in exchange for picks/rookie deals and then use their newly created trade exception to trade for a win now piece)

so they practically preserved 12m of their cap space",nbadiscussion
1158,163,[OC] Zion Williamson is tied for the 3rd highest points per touch (0.515) since the NBA started tracking touches (2013-14),"TL;DR: [Charts](https://imgur.com/a/ReOdvZF)

***

Being able to score without dominating the ball is a skill that has typically been reserved for the NBA's most deadly catch and shoot players. Since the NBA started tracking touches (2013-14), Klay Thompson, Terrence Ross, and JJ Reddick have regularly been among the league leaders each season in points per touch. 

However, this season, there is a new face at the top of the points per touch leader board (minimum 500 total touches). 

##[Through 15 games, Zion Williamson has averaged 0.515 points per touch.](https://imgur.com/OqAxOQx)##

That's notable because every other player at the top of the points per touch leader board (Ross, Bojan Bogdanovic, Warren, Booker, Reddick, etc...) are either used as catch and shoot specialists or could be used as catch and shoot specialists. Zion Williamson is neither of those things. He has created a new player archetype that I like to call the ""Catch And Score"" specialist.  

*** 

Furthermore, players who have a high points per touch average typically are not also volume scorers. Which makes sense. Teams want their best scorers to touch the ball as often as possible which would in turn bring down their points per touch average. And yet, Zion is averaging 24.1 points per game. 

##[No one in the history of the NBA's tracking era has ever averaged as many points per game and points per touch as Zion at the same time.](https://imgur.com/Nyuk5Tk)##

The closest anyone has come to this is Brook Lopez during the 2013-14. In a season in which he only played 17 games due to a foot injury, Lopez averaged 0.515 points per touch (the same as Zion) and 20.7 points per game. Worth noting that Shabazz Muhammad had a three year stretch (2013 - 2016) in Minnesota in which he dominated the points per touch leader board, albeit while only averaging around 10-15 points per game. 

***  

Zion's ability to draw quick fouls, snatch offensive rebounds, and throw down lob passes all contribute to his high points per touch average. Right now his role on offense is simply to catch and score. 

As he develops a handle and becomes more confident in his ability to make two and three dribble moves his points per touch average will inevitably drop, but I believe we'll see his name at the top of this leader board for several more seasons to come.

1159,164,Could we see a big jump in FT% in the bubble?,"A post currently near the top on r/nba peaked my interest a bit. I'm not 100% sure if it will make a huge difference to 3p%, but I think we could see a significant increase in FT% in the bubble.




The lack of fans plus like the other post said a static background. It's about as close to doing free throws in an empty gym as its going to get. I wonder if the players that you hear about that can make them in the gym but can't in games (Dwight Howard for example) might see a bump in there FT%. What's your thoughts, do you think we'll see an uptick? How much of it is outside factors and how much of it is just game nerves? 

Edit: Just thought I'd clarify I don't mean significant as in like 10% jump across the board. I meant more as statistically significant, as in there was a note able increase in FT% which would not have been expected had we been playing normal games. Even if its only for a select few players.

1160,165,Should we start including Andre Drummond as one of the greatest rebounders of all time? Where does he stack up historically?,"I’ve always had a soft spot for big tough centers who seem to be able to grab 15 rebounds at will, so I’ve enjoyed watching Andre Drummond play and grow up. But I was still incredibly surprised at his basketball reference page. He is barely 26 years old and he already has 7,555 rebounds and is 8th all time in rebounds per game with 13.8

He is a 3 time rebounds per game champion and over the last 4 seasons has averaged 15 per game! 

He’s led the league in total offensive rebounds 6 times in a row and total rebounds the past 4 years (though he is an iron man, and has only missed 10 games in 6 years) 

Perhaps most importantly though is that he’s led the league in offensive rebounding rate 4 times and total rebounding rate 3 times. 

In a time where rebounding stats can be deceiving, offensive rebound percentage can perhaps be the best metric and he is absolutely elite at it. He could be the best rebounder of the 21st century, but I’m curious what y’all think.",nbadiscussion

1162,167,[OC] Zion is justifying the Hype and playing in a unique way in today's NBA,"## Introduction

Zion Williamson is a breath of freshness with which he also brings a bit of old school basketball.

After 10 NBA games in which he gave us many highlights and wonderful moves with phenomenal numbers, we already have enough games, data and actions to analyze Zion and his style.

First, I have to say that the level of hype around Zion before, during and after the draft was definitely the highest in the last ten years. The one closest to Zion is probably Ben Simmons with comparisons to LeBron, but it still seems to me that Zion and the story around him is much bigger than Simmons.

## Things to work on

When I read his draft profile now, the most commonly mentioned negative sides were:

* Bad mid-range, three point shot.

* Poor when playing back-to-basket.

* Relying on strength in offense (alluding to the fact that this will not be possible in the NBA league).

* Bad efficiency from FT line.

And now that I've looked at the first ten games and watched Zion in great detail on how he plays, I can safely say that this is still true. Relying on strength is obviously not a problem, because he has absolutely blown everyone in front of him so far.

There is no shot from the mid-range/three-point range, it looks weird and he doesn't shoot that much (those 4 3PT made against the Spurs in the first game is a huge anomaly obviously). If you look at the [Shot Chart I made](https://i.imgur.com/fqZflem.png), you will see that Zion scored all but 8 shots from the Restricted Area. This is quite worrying to me, but on the other hand, very fascinating. Free throws have also remained a problem, with 65.4% being a fairly low percentage, and given that he is 9th in the league in free throws per game, this skill would greatly help him and his team if he were at an even higher percentage.

I would attribute the poor play of the back to the basket to the fact that he is not very skilled with the right (weaker) hand. This was most prominent against the Bucks (well, it is true that they are by far the best defensive team in the league) when Brook Lopez and Giannis shut him down. He was constantly directed at using his right hand, to which he responded with spins to his left hand and excellent pump fakes. But the ability to finish with the right hand is essential, especially with his style of play.

## Strenghts

### Next level rebounding

But all of these things are correctable, as many players have shown, it is possible to learn to shoot efficientlyeffectively. Right hand and post play can be straithened up through one summer. But those things that can't be learned, which you either have or don't have, Zion has in huge quantities.

Zion does not give up when he misses a layup or shot and fights to get offensive board. He's scary in that segment. 8th in the league in offensive rebounds per game, with all players ahead of him being at roughly 3 inches at least taller than him. As you can see in this [chart](https://i.imgur.com/5rBCYmT.png), ([here is version with cm instead of inches](https://i.imgur.com/bm4kEQp.png)), there is no other player who is less than 2 meters and has more than 2 rebounds in attack. The will, motor and the constant work is something that is visible ""from the plane"" with Zion, and it is the right recipe for the road to success.

Also, when looking at the ratio of [offensive and defensive rebounds](https://i.imgur.com/LysAv4X.png), Zion has almost more offensive rebounds than defensive. Only a handful of players came close to such feat along with him, and one of them is Montrezl Harrell. 

## Comparisons

Harrell is the player who currently most resembles Zion with his style of play, constitution, athleticism and skill. Both are awesome athletes and undersized Big Men, Harrell is 2.01m high (6ft 7) and Zion is 1.98m (6ft 6). They both score almost all of their points from the [restricted area](https://i.imgur.com/IR6rzzk.png). Both are also technically capable and know how to drive to the hoop. The only difference between the two is perhaps that Harrell relies more on Pick And Roll, and Zion relies more on Post game.

If you were to draw a parallel with some of the older players, Charles Barkley is a perfect comparison. The same height as Zion and very similar physique and athletic ability, Barkley terrorized the NBA while in a Philadelphia jersey. If someone were to offer the Pelicans Chuck's career in the form of Zion, of course with a couple of titles ;), I doubt they would complain. Other comparison would be Larry Johnson, who also has similar style and body.

## Conclusion

As the first sentence/title says, Zion brought a touch of freshness and old school basketball, and it's really a treat to watch a 19-year-old play around with experienced NBA players like he does. All I want is for him to stay healthy and then he will surely show his full potential, which is already present and visible.

1163,168,Is the disparity at the top of the East and Western Conferences overrated?,"This is the second year in a row that I have felt this way, at this time of the year. All year, the talk is about how much stronger the West is than the East, and for a long time that was just true across the board (eg. in the Duncan Spurs, Dirk Mavs, Kobe Lakers, Nash Suns era). But, while the West still has the edge in the middle and bottom, this is the second year in a row where the East has felt stronger at the top, at this point.

I am cheering for the Nuggets, who are legit, but, as much credit as I give them for making it this far, I am skeptical as to whether they would have gotten by a couple of the East teams that are out already (ie. the Bucks or Raptors).

Past the Nuggets, the teams that were supposed to be the reason for why the West was so stacked, largely turned out to be revealed as pretenders: Rockets and Clippers, I am looking squarely at you. The Rockets were pitched as a championship darkhorse, and the Clippers were pitched as the favourite (and part of this big 3 that was ""clearly"" a tier above the rest of the league), and, with the benefit of hindsight, I think we can pretty safely say that neither team actually was as good as advertised.

If you take the Lakers out of the equation (who I currently consider to be the title favourites), is there really any other team in the West that you would take in a series over the Heat, Celtics, Bucks or Raptors?

And, last year, was a similar sort of story: the Warriors were obviously legit, but would you have picked last year's Blazers or Rockets over the Bucks or Sixers? Much was made of the Warriors having no KD for the Finals, but they also didn't have KD for the 6-straight wins that got them past the Rockets and Blazers last year. In the Finals, the non-KD Warriors were clearly a step below the Raptors, despite the Raptors needing late game heroics to squeeze by the Sixers, and to avoid going down 3-0 to the Bucks, just to get out of the East.

The East still has a bunch of chaff at the bottom, right up to the 7th and 8th seeds, which were pretty weak this year. But, if you look at the top contenders in each conference, I think this is second straight year where you can legitimately say, with the benefit of hindsight, that the East had more legitimate championship contenders than the West did.",nbadiscussion
1164,169,Is anybody else extremely excited to see Kawhi vs Giannis?,"I mean, I just don't think we've ever, ever, ever had a matchup like this. 

&#x200B;

Two perimeter players who are both one of the 5 best offensive players, and 5 best defensive players in the league.

&#x200B;

Two unstoppable forces from the perimeter, who are one of the only handful of players in the league that could reasonably expect to guard the other. Going head to head! Guarding each other if not the entire game, then absolutely for stretches. 

&#x200B;

And they both do it in completely different ways- Kawhi is a lights out unassisted isolation scorer, and basically a Darelle Revis-level individual defender; Giannis is the center of a scheme and a roster devised to play perfectly around him and his versatility on both offense and defense. 

&#x200B;

When's the last time it was reasonable to think that in a matchup of two perimeter superstars, both might just actually be able to shut the other down instead of them trading points and putting each other on skates?

I'm fucking excited.",nbadiscussion
1165,170,[OC] Markelle Fultz is magically improving in Orlando,"Markele Fultz is averaging 11.9/3.4/5.0 this season with 1.3 steals per game, all with just 28.1 minutes on the court. He mostly shared the PG role with DJ Augustin, who was injured on 14th of January and missed the last month of action. During that period, Fultz saw even bigger increase in his role  and had 6.4 assists on average.

I made a [Shot Chart for Fultz](https://i.imgur.com/t0PLT80.png), and it can be seen that his shot is still problematic, but it is certainly improving. You all remember his shot with a ""hitch"" which is why he received various criticisms before the draft and during the first/second season. [This is what I'm talking about](https://streamable.com/gjj42). Even a person who has never played basketball can see that something is wrong here. Behind this is the story that the Sixers misdiagnosed his injury and gave him the wrong therapy, and as a result, the correction of his shot took too long. The story is quite complicated and can be comfortably told in a separate post.

Fast Forward to this season, and his shot [looks like this](https://streamable.com/h32of) (the recording was made during preseason). This is already much better. All in one fluid motion without hitches and ugly pauses. And even if you only look at the data you will see that his shot is improving. Free throw percentages through the seasons:

Season 1: 47.6 FT%
Season 2: 56.8 FT%
Season 3: 75.0 FT%

75% is already a solid percentage for a point guard, far from an above average percentage, but the FT% in first through seasons were terrible even for centers. The mid-range jumper now looks respectable for Fultz, but the three pointer still remains a problem because sometimes he has that hitch I talked about before. But all this is a very good sign and indicates that Fultz is doing a lot to improve the shot.

What Fultz is really good at now is driving and finishing at the rim, and some shots from the paint (generally from a distance shorter than free throw range). He ""wiggles"" around the mid-range in order to find the optimal shot or pass (many assists come from such ""cuts"" by teammates), and with this action he reminds me of Chris Paul and even Kawhi (they are not the same position, but Kawhi is one of the best at mid-range). I made a chart showing all the guards and their [efficiency in the ""Restricted Area""](https://i.imgur.com/hIlu7BU.png). In my opinion this is very encouraging for Fultz because he is more efficient than Westbrook, Lillard and Lavine (etc.) who are already renowned scorers.

Markelle is only the fourth option this season in Magic, behind Vucevic, Fournier and Gordon, and maybe even Isaac while he's healthy. I think this situation will change, especially if Fultz continues to work on his shot, as other segments are already covered pretty well. If all that happens, and I honestly think he will, Fultz could be a top contender for the MIP award next season, and then maybe some other awards...

Magic finally look to me as a team that has figured out things, as a team that has a future and invests in it. Fultz, Isaac, Bamba, Gordon, Iwundu are all good building blocks for the future with veteran reinforcements like Vucevic and Fournier holding the wheel in their hands for some time. They are also flirting with the playoffs this season, it would be really interesting to see Fultz play in his first playoff appearances.

And let's not forget, Fultz is 21 years old. For him, this was a Rookie season on a team that believes in and supports him. The best of him is yet to come..",nbadiscussion

1167,172,"Post All-star break, Mike Conley averaged 26/3/7 on 48/40/84 shooting. What are your expectations for Conley this season?","As everyone is well aware by now Conley has been traded to the Jazz and with other signings as well Utah looks set to be a major threat in the Western Conference.  
  
However opinions are divided with some people considering the team a finals threat and others believing they are severely overrated and a likely first round exit.  
  
Conleys move to the Utah Jazz looks like it could be a huge acquisition for the squad and he is part of a very solid core four alongside Mitchell, Gobert and Bogdanovic. These players are also all better than any teammates Conley had on the Grizzlies post allstar break so that leads to the question.

1168,173,Post NBA Bubble: Winners and Losers going into the 2021 Season,"Now that the NBA has successfully ended its season, I wanted to list the major winners and loser going into the offseason. We've seen teams overachieve and underachieve this season and I just wanted to know what you guys think about my takes on this. This is just my general thought after the 2020 season. A lot can happen in the offseason. Let me know what you all think or if I missed anything.

&#x200B;

**Winners** 

* Lakers (Obvious, won championship, best duo in basketball)
* Heat (Over performed expectations, great young core and superstar in Jimmy Butler)
* Nuggets (Young team with great potential, Jokic and Murray can only get better)
* Warriors (Sucked so bad and now they have a top pick in the draft, still have Steph, Klay And Dray for 2021. They can land X factor player or solid role players for next season)
* Mavs (Solid team, Doncic can only get better)

&#x200B;

**Losers**

* Clippers (mortgaged future and lost in 2nd round and blew a 3-1 lead. West will only get better next season)
* Bucks (No real ""star"" aside from Giannis. Giannis can only do so much. Got bounced by an underdog team. Could lose Giannis)
* Celtics (Great young core with decent vets, but when will they have enough to make finals? Too much talent to lose to Miami imo. Feels like they go through this every year now since 2018)
* Raptors (“Star” player couldn’t live up to moment. Don’t see them getting a star anytime soon to make them a championship team.)
* Rockets (Not really sure what they need to do next to win, Russ doesn’t compliment Harden)
* Sixers (Simmons won't shoot. Embiid is always hurt. Harris and Horford underperformed and are stuck there due to contracts)
* Pelicans (Zion’s is great but his longtime health is in question. BI is probably gone, Ball appears to be a bust, and they’ll probably trade Jrue Holiday. The team you traded AD to won the chip)",nbadiscussion
1169,174,Why all the Larry Bird slander?,"I've been seeing stuff on Instagram and other sports media outlets that have been trashing Larry Legend in comparison to today's stars, suggesting that he would've gotten cooked by guys like K.D., and though I'm not gonna argue that Larry probably couldn't have guarded possibly the best offensive player ever, I think that the younger media and fans as a whole has been disrespecting one of the all-time greats as of recently.

When people talk about how ""Larry Bird would've gotten destroyed by (insert athletic current-day scorer here),"" and how that makes him overrated as a player, I think that that's ignoring his actual game. He was one of the smartest forwards of all-time, using his lack of athleticism as an advantage by positioning his fairly large frame to get a lot of rebounds, and he was also one of the best passing forwards of all-time. If he played today, he might be better offensively, as he would be encouraged to shoot more than the max of 3 threes attempted per game that he shot at the peak of his career. He also was never a guy who was gonna beat you off-of his burst, and though I won't argue that defenders today are more athletic than they were in the 80s and that it would be tough for Larry to maintain his three-peat MVP level of dominance today, people write him off completely mainly because he dominated in a less-athletic era than today.

This writing-off happened in the 80s as well with the Pistons' ""Larry Bird would've been just another player had he been white"" comments, and though I believe that the NBA has gotten more athletic and skilled now with advance in technology, eating habits, and many other factors, saying that Larry can't hang in the discussion of all-time greats is just disrespectful.

Finally, with all of these dumb edits with Larry guarding Lebron or KD, he was never a particularly good defender, and he only got worse as his back problems flared-up fairly young for an NBA player. Overall, to say that Larry couldn't hang in today's NBA with his game as a shooting PF (I think he would've played more PF in today's game) who can also handle the ball and average around 8 APG is crazy to me, even if he's a step worse than he was in the 80s because of the improvement of competition in today's league. I would also like to note that I am in no way trying to imply or encourage any stereotypes in this, and I am merely trying to restate issues past of the Pistons' comments and such and try to interpret that into a modern context.",nbadiscussion
1170,175,Derrick Rose deserved his 2011 MVP,"I'm always seeing from LeBron James supporters that Rose robbed him of MVP because he was considered the 'villain' of the league because of his decision to leave to Miami. 

In reality, Rose simply deserved it. Yes, James posted both better regular & advanced statistics but there's more to the MVP than just basic statistics. 

That year, James had both Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade. Both of which were top 10 players. Bosh had averaged 18 and 8 whereas as Wade averaged 26-6-5. 

Rose's team, however, was constantly battling injuries. Their 2nd option in Boozer missed 22 games, their defensive anchor in Noah missed 34 games, and for much of the season Rose's next best players were Luol Deng & Ronnie Brewer. 

Rose as a 22 year-old led an awful-offensive, injured Bulls team to 62 wins and was their only legitimate option. And people make it seem like Rose's numbers weren't good in their own right, he averaged 25-4-8. 

A fact people forget it that LeBron didn't even finish 2nd for the award, Dwight did. Many NBA players such as Steve Nash, Chris Bosh, & LeBron himself said Rose deserved it.",nbadiscussion
1171,176,A false narrative has been created that it has always been Miami’s strong defence specifically “Bam” that beats the Bucks but in fact it is actually Miami’s 3 point shooting that have willed them to victory.,"If the reasoning for this is based on the regular season the problem with that is the heat won each time because they shoot lights out on 3 besides. There **latest match up and Heat lost the lead because there shooting fell off in the 2nd half and that’s because it’s hard to hold on to such high volume at great shooting efficiency** and that is exactly when the Bucks took over. 

It was never there defence that kept them in the game.

Each game Giannis still ate, putting up good numbers on good efficiency. **Giannis still averages about 25 PPG on approximately 58% TS.** One of the stat lines from this sample size includes a game where the **Bucks played there 3rd game in a row against the Heat** which is a big reason for why the Bucks lost. 

Miami has been a great 3 point shooting team the entire season. The **heat this season on average are making 18 3s a game on approx 43% against the Bucks.** That’s absurd and this happens because of the bucks defence since they leave streaky shooter(s) open as that is apart of there defensive scheme. Essentially **Miami is taking advantage of the shots the Bucks defence is giving up and actually hitting them at an above average clip** since they’re already one of the best shooting 3P shooting teams in the league. That’s another reason why Brooklyn kept shooting. 

So if the reasoning is Heat will win against Bucks because of the defence there is no proof it has worked; its always the offence and shooting.

The defence narrative would actually favour the bucks since they’re playing like an all time great defensive team and mainly because the game slows down along with becoming tighter and more intense in the post season and it would benefit the Bucks a lot as we’ve seen before; the **Bucks were one 2OT game away from being up 3-0 in the ECF.** The only problem is if a streaky shooter gets hot but in the playoffs we’ve seen 3 point shots taper off because of the defensive intensity but with no audience it’s a total different atmosphere that’s too hard to predict. It’s unprecedented. 

That’s why I disagree but only the playoffs and time will tell although I do see the heats defence perspective side of things but don’t agree with it because each of Miami’s win were because of there 3 point shooting never because of there defence.",nbadiscussion

1. The D-rose led bulls had an awesome young core, but he drove them all into the ground in the regular season. This led to them never truly achieving their potential in my eyes. 

2. The T-Wolves weren’t looking great before they got Jimmy Butler, and when he arrived they were sitting in the 3 seed before he was injured. He then completely botched the negotiation of jimmy which led to one of the biggest PR nightmares in recent memory.

1174,179,Kris Dunn's Defense,"I knew he was having a good defensive season but I hadn't realised just about every single defensive metric available is pegging him as a top 10 defender this season, it's insane:

- Not a metric per se, but he's **2nd** in Steals/game, **1st** in Steal %

- Bulls DRTG with Kris Dunn on the floor is **106.4**, 4.0 points better than league average, would rank **4th** in the NBA over a full season. They also improve by **+6.2** points on defense when he's on the floor.

- Defensive Box Plus Minus (BBRef) - **2nd**

- Defensive RAPTOR (which incorporates player tracking) - **7th**

- Defensive PIPM - **5th**

- Defensive Real Plus-Minus (ESPN) - **13th**

- Defensive RAPM / Luck-adjusted RAPM - **7th**

He should receive some serious consideration for an All-Defensive spot. He may not get it because the Bulls are bad and his offensive role is small (hence he won't be well-known to voters), but he's clearly been one of the best guard defenders in the league this year, and one of the most impactful defenders in the league, period.

- Here's a fantastic SB nation article on him written by Michael Pina - [""Kris Dunn is a dying breed in today’s NBA. That’s why he’s so fascinating""](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/2/27/21156173/kris-dunn-chicago-bulls-free-agency-contract-qualifying-offer)

I created a table to just compare these allstar/superstar duos against the Lakers in the playoffs. It's pretty interesting to see them all get dominated except for Jokic and Murray. Denver really put up a tough series against the Lakers.

Miami unfortunately lost Dragic. I would have probably compared Dragic/Butler vs. the Lakers if he wasn't injured. Abedayo was an all-star this year so it is still fair to say that the duo is Bam/Butler. Bam did get injured, but so did Westbrook who got injured and had Coronavirus.

I also added the Clippers for fun. This is in the conference semi-finals. Denver dominated the duo when they played together, and they had a -6.9 net rating.

I think the other point to see here is that the defense for these duos are all bad against the Lakers. Lakers just had their way against all the top duos.",nbadiscussion

When Casey won the award, there was a sizeable outcry from more than just Celtic homers about how Brad Stevens was robbed of the award. I'm partial to agree with that sentiment. If Brad never wins COTY, will he be the best coach to never win the award? On the other hand, is Casey the worst coach to ever win the award? Surprisingly, the award's been around since the 62-63 season, so we have a ton of groundwork to go off of.

What do you think of having the season end so late? Will this cause low viewership since it’s competing with NFL season and possibly MLB season? Or will it help viewership since people are less likely to be enjoying the weather in October?

1180,185,How Luka Dončić and Rick Carlisle helped Tim Hardaway Jr's recent turnaround and why it isn't only a hot streak,"**Introduction**

&#x200B;

In February of last year, the Mavs traded for the young star Kristaps Porzingis from the New York Knicks in a deal centered around acquiring the large contracts of the veterans Courtney Lee and Tim Hardaway Jr from NY. The latter was a controversial topic, since he showed the ability of being a great role-player in Atlanta but was an incredibly inneficient scorer during all of his time with the Knicks. And this perception of him continued in his first stretch of games in Dallas, since he shot 40% from the field and 32% from 3 in his 19 games with the Mavs' uniform last season.

Donnie Nelson led the way to the signing and re-signing of multiple role-players to get depth in the 2019 offseason, and with that, Hardaway's role with the new squad was a question. He started the season coming off the bench, and, unfortunely for Mavs fans, he continued being a inneficient scorer with questionable shot decisions and overall a negative for the team.

&#x200B;

**Rotation Changes**

&#x200B;

But then, Carlisle had an idea. After 13 games of playing the 27-year-old guard with the second-unit (shooting 34% from the field and 29% from 3 in that stretch), Rick introduced* Tim to the starting lineup, and it was an immediate success. In the first 5 games of the new rotation, Tim Hardaway averaged 20 points per game in 60% from the field and 61% from 3, with 4 games with 10+ points. That stretch included back-to-back 40+-point wins against the Warriors and Cavs and wins on the road against Phoenix and Houston.

The key factor to that success was limiting THJ to playing mostly with Luka instead of introducing him with the bench. Even though his stats coming off the bench were terrible, his numbers with Luka were incredible already. When the 20-year-old star was on the floor, Hardaway had a 117.3 ORTG, 98.7 DRTG, +18.7 NETRTG and his TS% was 7 points better. Knowing that, Rick made sure to reduce his minutes without the slovenian guard on the game and made him a starter.

In the month of December, excluding the 5 games Dončić didn't play with an injury, Tim Hardaway Jr. played 213 minutes WITH Luka on the floor and only 8 WITHOUT him. In comparison, THJ played 225 minutes with Luka but 119 without him in November. Not by coincidence, in the next 11 games as a starter (before the Luka injury), Tim averaged 15.7 points per game in 52/45/92 shooting splits and the Mavs enjoyed a 9-2 record.

&#x200B;

**But why is that the case?**

&#x200B;

A lot of people might be thinking ""Well, no shit that someone plays better when sharing the court with an MVP-caliber player that averages nearly 10 assists a game"", but Tim Hardaway specially benefits from that more than everyone else.

The reason he is having such a good time playing with Luka is that he is playing the catch-and-shoot role, and isn't handling the ball much. In Atlanta and NY, he had a frequency of catch-and-shoot attempts of 38% in average. In that stretch with Luka, the frequency was at 56%. Hardaway has problems when he tries too much on offense and attempts to create by himself. He is not good as a pull-up shooter and shot-creator, and that was the role Rick gave him in his first games in Dallas.

As he started to play with an incredibly high-usage guard that is having an MVP-type season, he didn't even have the opportunity to have the ball for long stretches anymore. With now a pure-shooter role, his efficiency got up by a good amount and he became what everyone hoped he would.

Again, not by coincidence, in the 5 games Luka didn't play with an injury, Tim averaged 18 points per game in 18 attempts and shot only 36% from the field and 37% from 3PT. And in the last 4 games with Luka, he averaged 15 points per game in 10 attempts and shot 55% from the field and 60% from 3PT.

In conclusion, I'll not try to say his success is only due to the season Dončić is having or because Rick is a great coach. He of course is probably working his ass off to fit with the team and win games. He accepted coming off the bench and even as a starter he accepted a lesser role than the one he had in NY. The new role he has is helping him become the player the Knicks hoped they'd get, and much of that is because of Carlisle and the system he stablished around the european sensation.

*Edit: As someone commented here, Tim's introduction to the starting lineup was due to Curry being out for a couple of games because he was sick.",nbadiscussion
1181,186,Post addressing 'the worst thing about the 3 pt revolution',"https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats_per_game.html

As you can see, league average FG% is not that different. Teams aren't just bricking out of nowhere. I really have no idea how that post got 300 upvotes. Stay woke people. 

It's also not that different from the offense from a decsde ago. Instead of shooting 3s, they just bricked long 2s instead. 

In fact, 3 pointers is by far the biggest reason for scoring averages going up. Pace, free throws per field goal attempt, and FG% have stayed consistent. It's the sheer volume of 3s that has changed. In addition, more 3s = more spacing, which leads to less contested drives, post ups, and even makes shooting for others easier. Give Giannis bad shooting teammates and I don't think he'd average even 25.",nbadiscussion
1182,187,Why does Shaq not take more flack for losing to the Jazz 4-0 in 1998?,"So...

Looking back at the 1998 season, the Lakers had made some improvements to make their squad better. In 1998, the Lakers finish with a 61-21 record, third to the Jazz (62-20) and Sonics (61-21).  This was a 5 win improvement from the prior year.

I like reading old /r/nba threads. A lot of them are fascinating. Here’s a fun one that I stumbled across recently.

**The Original Post.**

> Nearly five years had passed between Kobe and Carmelo's 60 point game. Before them only Shaquille O'Neil, Tracy McGrady, Allen Iverson, and Gilbert Arenas had 60 point games since 2000.

>So who do you think has the best chances to drop 60 in the future? I'm not asking when you think it will happen, but what players have the best chance?

>I think obviously Kevin Durant, and Carmelo Anthony are the best scorers in the NBA so they will definitely be high on my list. LeBron is such a freak in terms of size and talent and strength he is definitely up there as well. I think that Russell and Harden could drop 60 as well, dependent on who they are playing. And lastly I think that Curry could drop 60, potentially.

>I think that Wade and Kobe might not be able to due to declines. I think they might hit upper 40s and 50, but I think 60 is a stretch for even Kobe now.

**Most recent 40+ games at the time.**

The original thread was posted on the 25th January 2014, the day after Melo’s 62pt game against Charlotte. It was his thirty-fifth career 40+pt game at that point in time.

Here are the most recent big games (at the time) from the candidates mentioned in the OP.

Durant has thirty-six career 40+pts games at that point in time. In the three weeks prior to this post, KD has scored 48pts vs Minnesota, 48pts vs Utah, 54pts vs Golden State and 46 vs Portland.

Lebron has sixty-one career 40+pt games at that point in time. His last two big games was against Boston when he put up 45 in game 6 of the 2012 ECF and when he put up 40pts vs Sacramento in March 2013.

Westbrook has five career 40+pt games at that point in time. His last two big games was against Miami when he put up 43pts in game 4 of the 2012 Finals and when he put up 45pts vs Minnesota in March 2012.

Harden has three career 40+pt games at that point in time. His last two big games was against Oklahoma when he put up 46pts in April 2013 and when he put up 45pts vs Atlanta in November 2012.

Steph has four career 40+pt games at that point in time. His last two big games was against Charlotte when he put up 43pts in December 2013 and when he put up 47pts vs Lakers in April 2013.

**Added context:**

This is KD’s MVP year.

 Russ missed a lot of time this season due to knee surgery. 

Harden has been at Houston for a season and a half. 

Steph was breaking out and would make his first all-NBA team. 

This is Lebron’s last year with Wade. Wade only played 54 games this season. 

Kobe had returned from his Achilles injury already but had injured his knee vs Memphis in the previous month. 

**So what’s the answer?** 

Here is every 60+pt game since Melo’s 2014 game. The answer to the question was actually Lebron two months later but it’s interesting to see who else has (and hasn’t) hit the 60pt mark in the last six years.

**Would that list be surprising to people in 2014?**

Steph, KD, Harden, Lebron and Melo were popular/common answers and all were recognised as having the potential to put up big numbers in 2014. Harden’s done it four times, Lebron has done it once but Steph and KD both share a career high of 54pts so far. Melo would only hit the 40pt mark five more times in his career and never came close to 60pts again.

Obviously Booker hadn't been drafted yet, but what about Kobe, Klay and Dame? Did anyone see those performances coming in 2014? 

Actually, yes.

--------------------------------

For Dame, someone posted

> Damian Lillard. He has a bright future. 

And another said

> I think Lillard has a better shot at it if he's killing it from 3. I don't see either him or Aldridge actually doing it though

-----------------------------------

For Klay, /u/MarioTheGoat posted

>Dark horse is Klay Thompson. He's a fucking assassin and doesn't get enough recognition because IMHO he has the best shooter in the world on his team. 

And another said

> Klay Thompson. 20-25 from three

---------------------------------

Kobe was actually a really popular choice.

Someone said 

> I'd love to see Kobe just try to do it once before he retires. I think if he REALLY wanted to, he could, on like 50 shots.

And someone else said

> I honestly wouldn't be that shocked if Kobe hit 60 again. Obviously he needs to be healthy, and really just needs a game where they are down (Lakers aren't really that great right now and no one would blame Kobe for taking all the shots with the teammates he has right now) and he's feeling it which happens a lot considering how long he has been playing. Kobe won't shy away from shooting the shit out of the ball so I could see it happening.

----------------------------------------------

And as a final conclusion, here’s an interesting comment from /u/andthatssometrainshit.

>Kevin Durant is an obvious choice, particularly if he plays on a team without Westbrook or another solid number 2 option at some point in his career. Curry, too. Westbrook and Harden can probably do it, but they would need to be on worse teams. Consider the 60 point games that have occurred since 2000-2001. The best record of any of those teams was 45-37 (the 06-07 Lakers), and even that was probably a little high for their personnel. The others: 42-40 (05-06 Lakers), 43-39 (04-05 Sixers), 41-41 (06-07 Wizards), and 21-61 (03-04 Magic). In today's NBA, if you're on a 50-win team, it's near impossible to score 60.",nbadiscussion

The tournament is not seeded. It is simply the earliest draft year vs. the later draft year, alternating between left and right and top to bottom.

The first round:

2004 vs **2019**

|2004|2019|
|:-|:-|
|Dwight Howard|**Zion Williamson (PF)**|
|Emeka Okafor|**Ja Morant (PG)**|
|Ben Gordon|**RJ Barrett (SG)**|

I gotta go with 2019 here. This group is insanely balanced and freakishly athletic. Dwight Howard will bully Zion inside, but the spacing between Emeka and Dwight is a huge concern and come on... who is stopping Ja throwing lobs to Zion?

**2008** vs 2015

|2008|2015|
|:-|:-|
|**Derrick Rose (PG)**|Karl Anthony-Towns (C)|
|**Michael Beasley (PF)**|D'Angelo Russell (PG)|
|**OJ Mayo (SG)**|Jahlil Okafor (C)|

This is a tough one for me, because 2008 (the all potential team) is incredibly balanced and in all honesty probably play above their NBA production on a streetball court, but D'Angelo and KAT are a potent duo who can hit every shot on the court. I think Rose thrives in this tourney and Mayo and Beasley relish the stage. Going with 2008 and it may be controversial.

**2010** vs 2013

|2010|2013|
|:-|:-|
|**John Wall (PG)**|Anthony Bennett (PF)|
|**Evan Turner (SG)**|Victor Oladipo (SG)|
|**Derrick Favors (PF)**|Otto Porter Jr. (SF)|

Weak matchup. Not sexy at all. Oladipo does sing the anthem to kick off the tournament. That is really the only positive 2013 team can take home from this. 2010 blows them out.

**2006** vs 2017

|2006|2017|
|:-|:-|
|**Andera Bargnani (PF)**|Markelle Fultz (PG)|
|**Lamarcus Aldridge (PF)**|Lonzo Ball (PG)|
|**Adam Morrison (SF)**|Jayson Tatum (SF)|

2017 has the defense between Lonzo and Tatum. Tatum is going to boom Aldridge. It is known. But for some reason and based off all the times my homies and I got run off the court by a bunch of tall dudes that could shoot lights out.... I gotta go with 2006 here.

2005 **vs 2018**

|2005|2018|
|:-|:-|
|Andrew Bogut (C)|**Deandre Ayton (C)**|
|Marvin Williams (PF)|**Marvin Bagley Jr. (PF)**|
|Deron Williams (PG)|**Luka Dončić  (PG)**|

A lot of younger folks on here may be forgetting just how amazing Deron Williams was. I would love to see rookie Deron take on Luka. Insane basketball IQ. This is a 1 on 1 matchup for most of the game but Luka starts facilitating and  the rest of the 2018 team is just a tad bit stronger for me.

**2009** vs 2014

|2009|2014|
|:-|:-|
|**Blake Griffin (PF)**|Andrew Wiggins (SF)|
|**Hasheem Thabeet (C)**|Jabari Parker (PF)|
|**James Harden (SG)**|Joel Embiid (C)|

Hasheem Thabeet is an absolute liability here. Let's just get that out of the way... But Griffin and Harden is a nasty duo and we can park Thabeet in the paint without 3 seconds being called. This may be a controversial pick, but Maple Jordan, Mormon Jordan and The Process come up just short here.

2011 vs **2012**

|2011|2012|
|:-|:-|
|Kyrie Irving (PG)|**Anthony Davis (PF)**|
|Derrick Williams (SF)|**Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (SF)**|
|Enes Kanter (C)|**Bradley Beal (SG)**|

Huh... TIR that Enes Kanter was a Top 3 pick. No shade. Love Kanter. **But Kyrie, ""What does the word blowout mean to you?**"" 2012 is one of my favorites for this tournament. Elite D and two superstars. 21-3 final.

2007 vs. **2016**

|2007|2016|
|:-|:-|
|Greg Oden (C)|**Ben Simmons (PG)**|
|Kevin Durant (SF)|**Brandon Ingram (SF)**|
|Al Horford (C)|**Jaylen Brown (SG)**|

2007 is deeply affected by the Oden/Horford spacing (if only Mike Conley went a spot higher...). Can Ingram shoulder the scoring load over the course of the tourney? I don't know. But 2016 has enough defense to frustrate KD and knock out the best player in the tournament in the first round.

1188,193,It is time to be honest about the WNBA,"The NBA is the parent company to the WNBA, since there is no r/WNBAdiscussion I figured this would be the place to speak openly and honestly about the WNBA from a 15 year NBA fan's perspective.

For those unfamiliar with the origins of the WNBA the league was founded 24 years ago by the NBA under commissioner David Stern. The goal of this league was to get more women interested in basketball and to give Top-level American talent a place to play on the home front. 

Good intentions and for the first 5 years of the WNBA's existence things were looking up, the league expanded from 8 teams in 1996 to 16 teams to start the 2002 season. Average attendance started at roughly 9000 per game in 1996, spiked to 11k per game in 1998 and declined back to 9k per game in 2002.

Therein lies the first issue with the WNBA, after 2002 the per game attendance numbers started a slow decline, so much so that by time 2010 rolled around many teams were relocated to smaller arenas or simply folded. There are now 12 teams in the WNBA and only 3 of the founding teams are in the same city.  (4 founding teams folded and 1 was relocated 3 times)

The viewership and per-game attendance numbers were always low, people blame lack of marketing but if we're being honest almost every single person knows the WNBA exists. I believe that the main is reason is the general sports watching market is simply uninterested in professional women's basketball. Think about it, how many people do you know who watch the WNBA? Who buy the jerseys? or even go to WNBA games? (Pre-corona) I'm willing to bet that the number is quite low. 

The majority of sports consumers are male and the WNBA was created to lure females into sport consumption. On paper the idea makes sense right? 50% of people don't really watch sports and most are female, why not try to and acquire that market? The problem is in reality women consume so many other types of media that the WNBA simply does not compare to. Social Media sites, YouTube and even the Kardashians have higher rates of engagement and support than the WNBA ever will. Adam Silver even revealed during [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA-AqTIYJ5g&ab_channel=WNBAKicks) that they are frustrated that women are not showing up to the games. He also revealed that the WNBA is supported predominantly by older men.

The next problem is the biggest issue with the WNBA, there is a huge lack of entertainment value when you actually watch a game. Don't get me wrong, these women are phenomenal players and are fundamentally very very good. The problem is that biology is a bit of a motherfucker. Women cannot compare to men in terms of strength, acceleration or verticality. Think about a player like Gary Harris. His vertical leaping ability and hangtime in this play [is absurd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydacQNBzpo4&ab_channel=HouseofHighlights). Gary Harris is a solid player but he is no superstar player like Lisa Leslie or Candace Parker or even Brittany Griner. Yet those are the only 3 players in the WNBA to have dunked ever and none of them could jump like Harris can.

When you watch an NBA game there is always a chance to see a moment that captures our imaginations or even exceed them. Think about this play [JR Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w_1CsiLEfI&ab_channel=rymanoo) of all people did something that looked incredible. The entire stadium got on its feet, you probably have chills from watching that play. That is the power of the NBA.

The WNBA suffers from a lack of athleticism compared to the NBA and unless we make serious strides in genetic engineering that gap will simply never be closed.

Now we have to talk about money, a touchy subject because the WNBA does not share it's financial data with the public. Adam Silver also admitted that the WNBA receives 12 million a year from the NBA as a stipend yet the league itself still loses 20 million a year on average since its founding. Now all this would be scary enough to look at if I was a member of the WNBPA but the strange thing is all the coverage on the financials of the league are about the wage-gap between the two leagues. Granted initially the WNBPA said they just wanted the same percentage of BRI (basketball related income) as the men's league (men's league gets 50%). However if your league takes in roughly 60 million a year in income and loses 20 million a year, why would you be entitled to the same percentage? Your labor is not generating profits even close to what a healthy professional league should be.

Even if you triple the WNBA salary cap does it make the league more watchable? As per my earlier arguments I believe the answer is no.

Most WNBA players actually play overseas during the offseason in Eastern Europe and earn up to triple their WNBA income. Which begs the question why even come back? Just play in Europe make your money and rest during the regular WNBA season.

If you were a software engineer in Ohio and you got offered triple your salary to work in Poland or Turkey how seriously would you consider that job offer? 

This isn't a manifesto trying to take down women's sports. I enjoy women's tennis, I loved watching the US women's soccer team run rampant over the world cup and even female golfers are starting to gain popularity which is fantastic!

This is specifically about how the WNBA is a league on the decline and it has failed to establish a foothold in the US. The market isn't there, the product is subpar, the business is bad and the players make significantly more money elsewhere.

I am curious to hear what you guys have to say about the WNBA, do you think it has a future? If so what can the league do to generate interest ?",nbadiscussion
1189,194,"Lebron James fans tend to highly rate Scottie Pippen, this is because of the GOAT debate between LeBron and Jordan. What are other examples of this?","Another example, The Phoenix Suns fanbase likes to rate Gobert highly. Obviously this is because Mitchell vs Booker is often debated. The argument for Mitchell revolves around defence and winning more games.  
  
Suns fans as a result credit most of this to Gobert, which makes sense since he is a 2x DPOY with crazy advanced stats. Booker has never played with a player like Rudy so that's why they rate him highly. To prove that Booker is better than Mitchell. Hopefully this thread doesn't turn into a Booker vs Mitchell thread but this was the best example I could think of.

1190,195,"To be clear, I do not think this will happen nor do I want it to. That being said, if Giannis/Steph/Klay played together, what would be the best way to defend them?","Sorry to all of you who are as tired as I am of the WILL GIANNIS GO TO GOLDEN STATE??? hot takes. I don't think there's any real chance that happens, and I honestly don't want it to. It would be interesting to see from a basketball standpoint to be sure, but I think it's more fun watching the best players challenge each other as opponents instead of grouping up and decimating competition.

That being said, I'm asking this question specifically hoping to focus on that basketball standpoint and on the on-court logistics of this group rather than the NBA-wide drawbacks I already mentioned.

Forget the hot take articles for a second and think of this more like a basketball riddle.

The strength and synergy of this trio should be obvious. Steph and Klay are by far the best shooting duo basketball has ever seen. They do a lot more than shoot though: Steph, in particular, is an underrated passer ([slightly relevant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2hXbLvUWFg&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=NBA)) and leader who consistently brings the best out of everyone he plays with, and speaking more tangibly, Steph and Klay are two of the smartest and most effective off-ball movers basketball has ever seen. Giannis driving with those two screening and cutting and warping opponent defenses would surely be an intimidating prospect for the rest of the NBA. The Warriors during their dynasty (which may not be over) were historically great in transition too, which is also where Giannis happens to thrive.

The historically unparalleled perimeter gravity of Steph and Klay discombobulates defenses by pulling defenders out of the interior and leading to tons of accidental double teams, open lanes, and poorly contested layups/dunks. Conversely, the nearly Shaq-like interior gravity of Giannis, combined with his superior ballhandling and transition game, similarily warps defenses by pulling defenders *away from* the perimeter and forcing them to ""build a wall"" in the paint. This trio would undoubtedly play off one another's strengths beautifully and at first glance seems virtually unguardable.

But I'm of the opinion that no team is invincible. There will always be brilliant basketball minds like Popovich and Spolstera working day in and day out to find weaknesses to exploit and creative defenses to run. People thought the KD Warriors would be invincible (granted they sort of were), but the '18 Rockets gave a truly herculean defensive effort and came exceptionally close to stopping their incredible run. They didn't win, but they found a chink in the armor. I have no doubt that if KD stayed with the Warriors for long enough, someone would have built on what the Rockets did and eventually taken them down (not trying to take anything away from the Raptors' title, but they obviously didn't beat the full-strength KD Warriors).

Even if these hypothetical Giannis Warriors went on to win back to back titles, more and more of the league's focus would be on coming up with ways to stop their offense, and I think inevitably someone would come up with something effective. Even if that team ended up coming up short like the '18 Rockets, I have no doubt that over the course of a few years (ignore Steph and Klay aging for the sake of this question, because that's a boring answer) someone would end up pushing them to seven games.

The question is: what would that take?

A modified triangle and two, maybe, with two guys glued to Steph and Klay and the other three ready at all times to collapse on a Giannis drive? This would probably lead to lots of open looks from whoever else is on the floor with those three, but you might have to live with that.

Good personnel is at least as important a good scheme, too. Maybe the more critical factor here is finding someone who can do a respectable job guarding Giannis one-on-one over the course of seven games. Bam did a solid job this year, though he was clearly not alone as the Heat still utilized the ""wall"" quite a lot. Embiid and AD have also had some impressive defensive performances against Giannis in the past. The three-point revolution is still in full effect, but I think we're starting to see something else over the past few years: the rise of the versatile, switchable, athletic big-man.

That's about the best I can come up with: a combination of a clever zone; a player gifted with the size, strength, athleticism, hands, IQ, and discipline to play respectable defense against Giannis with no help; and a willingness to concede some easier shots to the two non-Giannis/Steph/Klay players on the floor.

I've only been watching basketball for a few years though, and I'm one person. I would love to hear from anyone who knows the sport better than I do wrack their brain for what kind of defense would be best suited against these three. I don't expect anyone to come up with the perfect solution, obviously, but do your best Popovich impressions and see what you can come up with! Imagine you're a coach whose job depends on playing a respectable series against these guys. There's got to be something!",nbadiscussion
1191,196,Kobe: A remembrance from an international fan,"I've never posted here before. I felt like I had to today. Just my thoughts. 

I am not a fan of Kobe Bryant. My friends who share my love for basketball know I decided a long time ago to die on the ""LeBron James is the GOAT"" hill. In fact most of my recent engagement on Kobe has been to troll him, including sharing digs at his overinflated ego, his annoying fans, his selfishness, his being a bully -  there really was no end to material (including some I posted as my WhatsApp status yesterday that has mercifully faded away now). 

What they do not know was that well before LeBron was even a blip on my radar, I knew and loved Kobe. My first exposure to a basketball superstar was watching Space Jam on our VCR in the dial-up age, and getting to know Michael Jordan as the man who teamed up with Bugs Bunny to save our planet. Broadband internet brought with it YouTube, where I stumbled into Kobe Bryant out of curiosity - and also probably because his was one of the few African-American names Malayalam newsreaders could pronounce correctly with any sort of consistency. The first real basketball memories I have are of watching Kobe in the Lakers purple and gold, shooting absurd midrange jumpers and going to the rim against men that were somehow even taller than him. That's how I fell in love with basketball, through those Kobe moments. It didn't hurt that he played just like MJ (intentionally so, I later learned). And that was the idealised image of basketball that I kept in my mind as a child till I knew better. Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny saving the world. Kobe Bryant, draped in purple and gold, wrecking guys on the hardwood floor. That gave this short pudgy Indian kid all sorts of hopes and dreams for what life could be like once he was older and taller.

As I grew older (sadly not taller) and learned more about basketball and life, I found new players to idolise, and reasons to distance myself from MJ (Bron better), and Kobe even more so - although Bugs continues to have a special place in my heart to this day. I have seen many people online talk about Kobe's ""complicated"" legacy. It's not that complicated - he was credibly accused of rape. He was a known bully, and fairly late into his career called a referee a ""fucking fag"". Kobe Bryant showed time and again that he was not what we would refer to as a ""good"" guy. And it felt great to be on Team LeBron, on the side of the ultimate family man who climbed out of poverty (Kobe's dad was a successful NBA player) and succeeded against all odds with the Godforsaken Cleveland Cavaliers (Kobe was drafted into the greatest franchise in modern NBA history). Loving LeBron over Kobe, to my young mind that did not give much heed to age, generations or Tim Duncan, meant never having to jump out in defense of a known sexual assaulter, never having to get creative with excuses for failure, never having to be mean about the new generation of players or bitter about how the game evolved, and never having to confront the idea of being a fan of a seriously flawed man. Life was good.  

It was when Kobe retired that I started to feel something missing. Of course, being who I am, I loved how his final game was a joke that wrote itself. He scored 60 points but on 50 attempts, shooting a spectacular 44% from the field. They kept feeding him the ball so that he could leave on a high note, the silver lining in a terrible season that was to become a reflection of what Lakers basketball would look like for the next few years. It was hilarious. But the Lakers won that game, breaking a 6-game losing streak on the final day of the season. Kobe got them the W. 

I never found another Kobe. There was the four-headed monster of Golden State to expend all my righteous fury on, an abomination that combined with the incompetence of the Cleveland Cavaliers organisation to take me into severe basketball depression. I couldn't even work up a little schadenfreude from watching the Lakers ruin themselves on the back of Deng and Mozgov and their many other failed experiments (okay, maybe a little), but they were no fun to hate on after Kobe left. They were a team without their star. No real identity except angry dudes online clamouring about the glory days of Jerry, Wilt, Kareem, Magic, Shaq and - of course - Kobe. Basketball hasn't been the same since Kobe left. 

As I grew older and a little more mature, I also had to accept - first begrudgingly, then admiringly - that the Kobe I was seeing post-retirement was not the guy I distanced myself from. He was a loving father to four girls, and a mentor to players decades younger than him that were coming into the league. He had educated himself on LGBT rights and chastised toxic fans online who were using the same language he had used on the court. He was an ardent advocate for the WNBA. He was on late night talk shows telling people about how his daughter Gianna said she would carry on his legacy, and how they didn't need a son for there to be a third generation basketball star in the Bryant clan. He won a frickin' Oscar for an animated short based on his Dear Basketball, a poem he had published for The Players' Tribune at the time of his retirement - my only comment on that piece is: ""inject that shit right into my veins"". I realised that not only was basketball not the same since Kobe left the league, but Kobe wasn't the same either - maybe even before he left the league. The modern Kobe was a man who was working hard to overcome the sins of his past, clearly conscious of the huge black marks they would leave on his legacy, working hard to broaden the latter so that the former would become smaller and smaller when we finally took it all in. I don't think it erases them. If anything, we should keep highlighting his wrongs, to tell the story of survivors, to remind us of what even the most celebrated people are capable of in their darkest and weakest moments. If he really was a changed man, I think he would understand.

And then Kobe really left. Suddenly. Without warning, a day after Lebron overtook him on the all-time scoring leaderboard in his own hometown (wearing shoes that read ""Mamba4Life"", and then proceeding to give a long interview on what Kobe meant to him and the support Kobe gave him as a teenager coming into the league). Kobe's chopper went down with Gianna and 7 others along with him, sending tens of millions into mourning and many others not knowing what to feel. At first I didn't believe it. It couldn't be. Not like that. Not with his kid. Not when I had just gotten used to seeing them on the sidelines taking in the game they both so clearly loved together. That poor mother. Those poor girls. Once I realised what was happening, I couldn't take my eyes off my phone as reactions started pouring in. As I watched celebrities, players and other basketball personalities and most importantly fans agonise over his loss. As they commemorated him with gatherings, artwork, social media posts, emotional interviews, shot-clock violations and crazy stat lines, for a while there I went back to being that pre-teen loading up videos of Kobe destroying guys on the court, in awe at that blur of purple and gold and the sheer skill on display.

As international fans, our connections with the things we love are remote and intimate at the same time. We aren't really there, but we always are. We can't really see them, but we always do. We shouldn't be able to feel the same things, but we somehow do. A young Indian man in his twenties can weep over the death of an African-American sportsperson in his forties who was taking his daughter to her basketball game. A corporate lawyer cramped into a cubicle in an air conditioned building in Bengaluru can feel like he's with the crowd outside Staples Center that gathered to mourn their superstar. A 12-year old discovering YouTube in the Middle East can admire Kobe Bryant for putting up 81 points in a single game. A 13-year old can watch in awe as he took over an Olympic finals on a team that included Dwyane Wade, Chris Paul, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony and yes, LeBron James. An 18-year old college student can distance himself from an idol of his childish youth because of the bad he is capable of. Even if he still took the odd dig or two here and there, a 24-year old can, while being fully conscious of the pain Kobe caused, find his way back to the Kobe of his childhood because of his respect for the Kobe of today. Well, of the day before yesterday.

Maybe I am a Kobe fan after all. Rest in Peace, Legend.",nbadiscussion

1193,198,"[OC] Even with Zion hurt, the New Orleans Pelicans are talented and deep. And 0-4. So what's the problem? And what's the solution?","**part one: A HOT POT OF JAMBALAYA**

This past summer, the New Orleans had as good of an offseason as you can expect for a team that had to trade away (arguably) the best player in franchise history smack dab in the middle of his prime. 

The reasons for optimism were multi-faceted. Obviously, the draft gods smiled upon them and granted them Duke PF Zion Williamson, one of the better and more marketable prospects of the century. More than that, the team secured two respected executives for their front office in David Griffin and GM Trajan Langdon. Immediately, they proved their cool head and competency. The new front office was largely hailed for the return on their Anthony Davis trade, using AD to land a load of assets, and parlaying those assets into even more. 

By the time the dust and beignet sugar settled, the Pelicans looked absolutely stacked with young talent, and also stacked to the brim with depth. Depth on top of depth. In fact, it's fair to suggest that the Pelicans have 12+ players who should be playing in a rotation somewhere around the league.

In some ways, the new-look Pelicans felt like TWO separate teams smushed together. You had a group of young talent (led by Zion Williamson and the old Lakers core) that would still have some growing pains but a high ceiling, and you had the veteran core that could theoretically compete for a playoff spot now (led by Jrue Holiday and new additions J.J. Redick and Derrick Favors.) 

For the sake of illustration, here would be those ""two"" rosters:

######**team win now (or at least, ""go .500 now"")**

PG: Jrue Holiday (29 years old)

SG: J.J. Redick (35), E'Twaun Moore (30)

SF: Darius Miller (29) *injured*

PF: Nicolo Melli (28)

C: Derrick Favors (28)

######**team win later**

PG: Lonzo Ball (22 years old), Frank Jackson (21)

SG: Nickeil Alexander-Walker (21)

SF: Brandon Ingram (22)

PF: Zion Williamson (19)

C: Jaxson Hayes (19)

**floaters** (who can fit either team): Josh Hart (24 years old), Kenrich Williams (24), Jahlil Okafor (23)

Perhaps my estimate that this team had 12+ capable rotation players may have been under-selling them; that's 14 players who could be getting minutes on a team somewhere and would have been 15 if Miller had been healthy this year. 

Because of that insane depth (and because of Zion Williamson), the Pelicans had been regarded as a darkhorse pick to make the playoffs. The top 8 in the Western Conference may have been tough to crack, but their over/under of 39.5 wins suggested that they had a puncher's chance. Who knows; maybe Zion Williamson could come into the league with Blake Griffin type impact (22-12-4 as a rookie) and fuel that spark. 

---

**part two: A BUBBLING MESS**

Unfortunately, things have not gone according to plan. Zion Williamson got injured, and is expected to miss a month or two of the season (and may be held out longer.)

In his absence, the team looks disjointed and confused. There's some ""good"" (like Brandon Ingram's scoring), but plenty bad. Coach Alvin Gentry hasn't settled on a rotation yet, and can't figure out the right concoction and recipe for success. The team has started 0-4, and has struggled mightily on the defensive end. They've given up 120+ points in every game, and rank 29th (among 30 teams) in defensive rating.

Any team with a bunch of new pieces is bound to have some growing pains, but there's not much room for error in the stacked Western Conference. 45+ wins is a good bar to shoot for to make the playoffs, and that's starting to look out of reach. If the team can't get their defense straightened out, 30-35 wins may be a more reasonable expectation for this season.

And if that's the case... what then? Do you simply shrug and push your timeline back a year or two? That would make sense in theory, but there's some degree of a ""ticking clock"" here. Brandon Ingram will be a restricted free agent this summer, and will be a handsomely paid one if he continues his hot start. His current rates (27.3 PPG, 9.5 REB, 4.8 AST) aren't sustainable, but he could realistically hit 23-7-5 in a fast-paced offense like this. And if he does, he may be near ""max"" range.

While the pace and space system of Alvin Gentry fits with the talent in either timeline, coach Gentry may be worried about time himself. He's 64 years old, and entering his 5th year with the team. As likable as Gentry may be, it's not easy for coaches to survive prolonged losing stretches. So far, he's finished 30-52, 34-48, 48-34, and 33-49. If he can't win 35 games this season, that'd be the 4th time out of 5. If David Griffin wanted to find ""his own"" coach, he'd have every excuse to make that move. He can look outside the organization or within, as top assistant Chris Finch is among the top rising stars in the league given his offensive acumen. 

Going forward, you have to wonder if there's going to be a push and pull between these forces. Griffin and the front office (in their first year) should have plenty of leash and plenty of patience, but Gentry and the coaching staff may feel some pressure to ""win/compete now."" As the Pelicans figure out and formalize their rotation, those big picture decisions will become more critical.

---

**part three: SELLING OUR STEW AT THE CRESCENT CITY FARMERS MARKET**

0-4 is a disappointment, but it's less than 5% of a regular season. There's a decent chance that the team rattles off some wins and gets back into a respectful range. It's way too early to panic or make serious decisions about their future.

But what if 0-4 turns into 3-10? Or 10-20? How long before we write off this season? How long before we hit the ""panic"" button?

Of course, ""panic"" is a relative term. Even if they're 10-20, the Pelicans still don't *have* to do anything. They don't have cap problems (right now), and they still have a bright future. There's plenty of excitement about this young core. Hell, even if Zion Williamson misses this entire season, ESPN will still be hyping up his debut next year as a headline story. The Pelicans can take their lumps right now, and utilize their veterans as mentors along the way.

That said, they have the opportunity to shift gears, pivot, and perhaps turn some of those veterans into trade chips instead. Let's take a look at how that may work, from a practical perspective.

The first shoe to drop would be **SG E'Twaun Moore**. In fact, that shoe may already be on the floor. At the moment, Moore's not even in the rotation (although injury recover may explain some of that.) But when healthy and fit, Moore's an underrated player and fills the template of a 3+D wing. In fact, he's hit 42.5% and 43.2% of his threes the past two seasons. He's only 6'4"", but he utilizes his wingspan (6'9"") to be a positive defender. Know any teams that could use a solid 3+D SG? Yeah. Basically *every* team.

Better yet, Moore would be a simple and cheap acquisition. He's on the last year of a reasonable deal ($8.7M). Would the Pelicans miss him? Not terribly. At the moment, SG is one of the Pelicans' lowest priority needs. They have Jrue Holiday and Lonzo Ball playing both PG/SG, as well as J.J. Redick, Josh Hart, and Nickeil Alexander-Walker. Moore would be more valuable to another team than their own. In terms of a ""trade return,"" you can't expect the world, but you can expect a positive asset. A team like the Milwaukee Bucks is always on the lookout for 3+D wings, and Moore would fit that roster nicely. And if the Pelicans don't intend to bring Moore back next season, it's a move that they simply must consider. 

In fact, the Pelicans don't just have one veteran shooting guard to spare; they may have *two*. To that end, they should consider trading **SG J.J. Redick** when eligible. Redick is a good guy and a good mentor, but he's over-qualified for that role. He can still contribute to a winning team. Two seasons ago, Redick set a career high with 17.1 points per game (at age 33.) The next year, he set a *new* career high with 18.1 points per game (at age 34.) That Dorian Gray run will probably end this year (he's had an underwhelming start with 25.5 minutes and 9.5 points per game), but he can still serve as a complementary scorer and spacer.

Logistically speaking, a J.J. Redick trade isn't far-fetched either. Redick is due $13.5M this season, and $13.0M the next. It sounds a little pricy for a 35-36 year old, but he should still be able to contribute 25 minutes a night to a good team. And while a 1:1 swap gets tricky in this price range, a team like the L.A. Lakers could find a way to cobble together matching salaries. For example, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope ($8.1M), Quinn Cook ($3M), and Troy Daniels ($2.0M) would hit our mark. The Pelicans have no reason to simply hand Redick off to a contender out of the kindness of their hearts, so they'd like at least a *little* asset back for their services. Dealing a heavily protected R1 pick isn't absurd to ask for when you're dealing with teams that have their eye on the 2021 title. Presumably, Redick would be more than willing to accommodate a trade himself. Not only does he have a playoff streak to consider, but he's nearing the end of the road and running out of chances to chase a title.

In terms of other potential assets, the Pelicans have a few, but may not be as willing to deal them. A trade for **PF/C Derrick Favors** doesn't look likely at this point. While Favors can contribute to a winning team, the Pelicans are thinner in the frontcourt than the backcourt right now. With Williamson injured and Jaxson Hayes still so raw, Favors is a nice fill-in safety net down low. Over-extending either Williamson or Hayes (and risking their health) wouldn't be a prudent move. Similarly, a trade for **SF Darius Miller** (a decent stretch wing) is nullified by his own injury. And of course, the Pelicans wouldn't trade any of their young talent because that should remain their top priority. Among the roster, Moore (and maybe Redick) appear the most likely candidates.

---

**part four: POTENTIAL VOODOO CURSE**

As mentioned, if the current Pelicans continue to struggle this season, it's not a big deal. If they sell off some veterans, it's not a big deal. The playoffs in 2020 were always going to be less of a focus than the playoffs in 2021, and 2022, and 2023 and beyond.

But from a big picture perspective, a bad start *next* season would be scarier than [Baron Samedi](https://jamesbond.fandom.com/wiki/Baron_Samedi). If the Pelicans stumble to a bad start in 2020-21 and still don't look ready to contend for the playoffs, then you have to start to wonder about kicking the can even further down the road and potentially considering a trade with **PG Jrue Holiday**. 

On face value, that sounds insane. Holiday is one of the faces of the franchise, and coming off one of his best stretches in his career. But naturally, when a player is in his prime like this (age 29), he won't be this good forever. And at the end of the day, the Pelicans are going to have to ask themselves: will there be enough of an overlap between Holiday's best years, and the primes of our young stars like Ingram and Zion Williamson? If not, they may have to fully embrace the youth movement and pencil in a year like 2023 as their target to contention.

What's so nice about being David Griffin and the Pelicans right now is that even *that* nightmare scenario doesn't sound so bad. When you have a foundational piece like Zion Williamson, then you can afford to wait and wait and load up some youtube highlights whenever you get cold and lonely after a loss at night. To that end, the REAL nightmare scenario for this franchise would be whether Williamson's health injuries persist, and if you start to doubt whether his body is made for an 80-game NBA grind.

As long as Williamson stays healthy, the future will be bright. But as far as *this* season goes? As far as *this* jambalaya tastes? We may be running out of time before we start siphoning out ingredients and rethink the recipe.

1194,199,"Michael, Kobe, and LeBron: Evening Out The Playing Field","**Methodology**

If you don't care about all this business, the final stat lines are near the bottom.

The question we are looking to answer is: if we adjusted Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and LeBron James' stats to where they are all playing on common ground (pace of game, team shot distribution, etc.), whose stats would be the best of the three?

We took each of the 3 players' best 5 seasons by total win shares, and averaged each player's stats across those 5 years. We then took data from every team that played in each of those seasons, and averaged up the 15 seasons to get a sort of common playing ground. We then used that data to answer questions such as this: if Michael Jordan took ""x"" percent of his team's three pointers, how many threes would he take if his team were taking as many threes as the 15 season average? By using that same method for each of the following sections, we can get a somewhat better idea of how each player's stats would look on common ground.

We would predict that their final stats would be somewhere between their actual per-game stats, and their idealized per-100 possessions stats. Consider the final stat lines as ""per adjusted 100 possessions"" which as we will find out will come closer to \~93 possessions. It's just more complicated than taking per 100 and multiplying by 0.93.

Obviously not a perfect system. It's easy to wonder that had Jordan played in the ""three point era"", he would have taken a greater percentage of his team's three point shots. Equally, taking Kobe or LeBron back to what is generally considered a more physical era of basketball may have affected their stats in either direction. Level of teammates was also not adjusted for, and that can have an influence on some stats.",nbadiscussion
1195,200,2013 NBA Draft; the craziest hindsight draft story in NBA history?,"Craziest to look back on has to be 2013.

Some crazy facts:

• Anthony Bennett went 1st overall. He played 4 season on 4 different teams before leaving the NBA. He never averaged over 5PPG

• Just ONE lottery pick from this class has made an all-star team (Victor Oladipo, 2nd overall)

• Giannis Antetokounmpo went 15TH OVERALL!! Not even a lottery pick and wasn’t considered to even have a chance at the time. Now, he is the supposed handler of the torch after LeBron retires.

• Rudy Gobert, 2x Defensive Player of the Year, went 27TH!

• MICHAEL CARTER-WILLIAMS (11th overall) won ROTY and was seen as the “next big thing” (EDIT: in Philly during early Process era, to clarify; he averaged 16/6/6/2)

• Just THREE 2nd round selections still have a job in the NBA

• SIX of the top-10 picks (this doesn’t include Bennett) never made an impact and have made a career as a bench booster

• Aside from Victor Oladipo and Giannis, only CJ McCollum (who went 10TH!!??) came out of this class and has posted at least one 20+ PPG season

• The Cavaliers won 1st overall pick, selected Bennett, and traded him to Minnesota. The next year? The Cavaliers won 1st overall pick, select Andrew Wiggins, and traded him to Minnesota. Both were considered major talent coming into the league. In hindsight, neither of those players play for Minnesota anymore and both were considered extremely disappointing considering their potential. The Cavs won the NBA championship three years after the Bennett selection.

• Only Giannis, McCollum, Adams, Roberson, and Olynyk have ever played any meaningful minutes in a Conference final.

I swear, this draft was a troll all around. Any other crazy facts I’m missing? Would love to hear more about this absolute mess of an NBA draft.

EDIT: I actually forgot to include Steven Adams at 12th as well. On Wiki MCW is just above him and was distracting, lol. Seems like two international elite big-guys were passed on, and not just Gobert.",nbadiscussion
1196,201,TIME IS A FLAT CIRCULO: how Lonzo Ball is following in Ricky Rubio's footsteps,"
When we compare prospects and players, we tend to default to more obvious parallels. Sometimes it's about the *look* of a player. *Hey, Brandon Ingram is a super-skinny scorer? Sounds like Kevin Durant to me!*. Sometimes it's about their circumstance. *R.J. Barrett = Canadian = Andrew Wiggins!*

Because of that tendency, one of the most glaring comps may be underplayed: Lonzo Ball and Ricky Rubio. Some have mentioned it, but it should be talked about more often. In fact, their career arcs have some striking similarities.

**uno: Magical Prospects**

In 2018, Luka Doncic came over to the States with an unprecedented resume for a player his age. But before him, Ricky Rubio was the most hyped European prospect of this new century.

Back in his day, Rubio was the definition of a wunderkind. He debuted in the Spanish ACB league at the age of 14, the youngest ever. He won multiple honors in Europe, and even earned a spot on Spain's Olympic team at the age of 18. In those Olympics, he more than held his own, and helped keep the hype growing into near-legend.

In terms of evaluating Rubio as a prospect, his stock felt less about raw stats or tangible athletic traits as much as a ""magic"" touch. He was a big point guard with EXCEPTIONAL vision and passing ability. Whatever the ""it factor"" is, he had it. Naturally, he'd earn some comps to Magic Johnson as a result.

In 2009, Rubio was selected with the # 5 pick by Minnesota, which seems to suggest he wasn't *that* elite of a prospect. However, we have to remember that there was uncertainty about when/if Rubio would come over from Europe at all. In fact, he ended up staying there with FC Barcelona for the next two seasons after being selected. If he had a clear path to the NBA right away, he would have been a top 3 pick if not # 1.

Nearly ten years later, Lonzo Ball and the family circus burst onto the scene. Like Ricky Rubio, Ball was a big point guard whose stock had less to do with raw scoring or athleticism as much as his exceptional passing and feel for the game.

At the time, Ball was also known as an exceptional winner who elevated his team around him. His Chino Hills high school team dominated in California, and he had a similar effect in his freshman season at UCLA. The previous year, the Bruins had gone an embarrassing 15-17. With Ball and his freshmen teammates, they immediately vaulted up to 31-5. Clearly, this kid had the magic touch! The ""it factor""! Magic Johnson himself signed off on the kid, adding to the obvious comparison there. In fact, Johnson and the Lakers jumped on Ball with the # 2 pick.

Even beyond their basketball stock, Rubio and Ball had enormous international profiles for different reasons. For Rubio, it was the European acclaim, and the type of good looks that sparked to young girls and bicurious boys alike. And while we may all roll our eyes at the bombastic Lavar Ball, Lonzo's dad's antics did help generate more attention for his son. To call Rubio and Lonzo Ball ""hyped"" prospects would be an understatement.

**dos: Clear Weaknesses**

While Ricky Rubio and Lonzo Ball hit the ground running in the NBA and started immediately, the holes in their games became more obvious and more concerning than anticipated. For both: the inability to shoot the ball consistently.

Despite extra seasoning in Spain, Rubio stumbled out of the gates with field goal percentages of 35.7% and 36.0% over his first two seasons, truly abysmal numbers. Over time, he's elevated that slightly, but his career numbers still sag at 38.8%. As far as NBA players go (let alone starters), that's a bottom-barrel number. 

Moreover, this isn't a matter of someone simply launching a lot of three pointers (where 38% would represent an excellent mark.) Rubio has shot only 32.2% from three in his career, a number that hasn't improved over time. In fact, he was down to 31.1% last season with Utah. In today's NBA, not being to shoot from long distance is usually a death sentence, so Rubio's ability to withstand that deficiency may oddly be a badge of honor. 

While Lonzo Ball's career is still getting started, he's exhibited a similar distaste for putting the ball in the net. Over his two-year career, he's shot 38.0% from the field (similar to Rubio's 38.8%), and 31.5% from three (similar to Rubio's 32.2%). In fact, you can argue that Lonzo Ball's shooting issues are even more severe than Ricky Rubio's (at least, at this stage), because he's also atrocious from the free throw line. Last season, he shot a mind-bogglingly bad 43.7% from the charity stripe. Oddly enough, Rubio shoots a healthy 83.8% from the free throw line, which does help bump up his true shooting into the 51-52% range these days. But without that type of boost, Lonzo Ball's true shooting last season registered 48.7%, a mark about 6.5% below league average. Not coincidentally, that 48% TS mark is the same as Ricky Rubio's sophomore year in the league.

As mentioned, an inability to shoot usually squeezes you out of the lineup faster than you can forget the name Stanley Johnson, so these two guards clearly have something else working in their favor. And as it turns out, there may be more virtues there than anticipated.

**tres: Unexpected Strengths**

In terms of the ""pros"" and ""cons"" of Ricky Rubio and Lonzo Ball, they largely delivered on what's expected of them. They're not scorers, but they can contribute in other ways with great passing ability and strong rebounding numbers for the position.

However, both Rubio and Ball turned out to be better than expected in one facet of the game: defense.

Coming over from Europe (as a white dude), Ricky Rubio faced the perception that he'd struggle defensively. But as it turns out, Rubio's size and basketball IQ have helped him thrive on that end. ESPN's real plus/minus metric has routinely graded Rubio as one of the best defensive point guards in the league, including a +1.03 mark this past year. To be honest, there's still some debate about the *extent* of Rubio's skill on defense. Other advanced stats (like Five-Thirty-Eight's DRAYMOND) don't grade him as well. Still, we'd count defense as one of his strengths. His length allows him to hang against multiple opponents, and that IQ, savviness, and sticky hands have enabled him to be quite a ball thief. For his career, he's averaged 1.9 steals per game.

Coming out of UCLA, Lonzo Ball had some of those same concerns about his defensive potential. The defining moment in that debate was during UCLA vs. Kentucky, when he continually shied away from guarding De'Aaron Fox, and got roasted by Fox whenever he did try to stay in front of him. The takeaway was that Ball may be a bad NBA defender himself.

Clearly, the opposite has turned out to be true. Lonzo Ball's defense has been among his greatest strengths. Like Rubio, his primary virtues there are his size and instincts/BBIQ. He can guard multiple positions, and can also be a disruptor on defense (with 1.6 steals and 0.6 blocks per game so far.) And like Rubio, Lonzo Ball is a darling of the ESPN RPM metric. That stat graded his defensive impact as a +2.3 as a rookie (3rd best among PGs) and +1.3 this past year (8th best among PGs.)

**cuatro: Wayward Journeys**

Clearly, Ricky Rubio and Lonzo Ball bring a lot of good and bad to the table, and NBA teams need to gauge just how much they value those particular skills and weaknesses. Do the positives (passing + rebound + defense + size) outweigh the negatives (shooting)?

Given the importance of shooting, it's not as easy of an answer as you may suspect. And it's a discussion that has plagued their respective teams.

Early on in Minnesota, the Timberwolves were fully on board with the Ricky Rubio Experience. In fact, they even risked their relationship with statistical stud Kevin Love by not giving him a full five-year deal (saving that for Rubio's free agency to come.) The implication was clear: *Rubio* was their primary building block.

For a while. After 6 years (and 0 playoff appearances), Minnesota felt the relationship had ran stale. They traded their once-franchise player to Utah for a modest price (R1 pick), and turned the job over to a veteran in Jeff Teague. While Teague is a fine starter, no one's ever confused him for a generational talent.

Over the last two seasons in Utah, Ricky Rubio has played well, and helped the Jazz secure playoff tickets. Still, the franchise made a point of getting more shooting this summer, and marked that PG spot as a possible area to upgrade. To that end, they brought in Mike Conley to replace Rubio in the lineup.

But don't cry for Rubio, Barcelona. While he may be on the move once again, he's not exactly a penniless nomad. The Phoenix Suns signed Rubio to a healthy contract this summer (3 years, $17M per season.) Certainly, *they* value his positives over his negatives and consider him a legitimate and quality starter at PG. And for their purposes, he's a clear upgrade at point guard.

Lonzo Ball's faced some similar upheaval in his young NBA career. The Lakers briefly embraced him as a bedrock of the future (and even traded away D'Angelo Russell to help give him more room to grow.) However, the signing of LeBron James changed the timeline and the equation mightily, and turned their native son into the red-headed stepchild overnight. 

After a year of awkwardly trying to get along, the Lakers included Ball in the Anthony Davis package and shipped him off to New Orleans. Because of that package, it's hard to gauge Ball's specific trade value. Still, he's presumably viewed as a true asset by David Griffin and New Orleans, and will have every opportunity to continue as a long-term starter for them.

But for both Ricky Rubio and Lonzo Ball, this year represents an important test case. Do their positives outweigh their negatives? Are they true starters? Their (new) teams think so. But for everyone else, that matter will be a polarizing and [philosophical debate](https://images.app.goo.gl/1KCo4M1DcHmSPSJs7).",nbadiscussion
1197,202,[OC] A Friendly Reminder that Kemba Walker Isn't on the Hornets Anymore And They're Doing Ok,"I once drove three hours to watch a game alone. Escaping the office with a poor excuse, I strolled into the Spectrum Center, avoided eye contact at all cost and sunk into a 101 section seat that I wasn’t supposed to be in. Hiding a Bullets hat under a gray hoodie and rocking a pair of Jordan 10s, I thought I could just enjoy the game of basketball as an away fan. 

The cold February night was supposed to feature a match-up between Kemba Walker and Bradley Beal. Two guards held back by the talent they were surrounded with were going to battle it out. And as a Wizards fan, everything told me that Bradley Beal was better than Kemba Walker. For the next 8 minutes of game time, I watched a team defeat a group of individuals in a game of basketball. Beal dropped 46 but all that mattered was that Kemba Walker 27 points, 11 assists. Nicolas Batum’s 20 and more importantly, his return to the 2-role while Miles Bridges got the start at the 3 didn’t matter as much. Kemba played well.

For all of the 2018-19 season, it was about Kemba’s free agency value—not the recognition of the Charlotte Hornets’ development of something different. This piece is going to contain a lot of conversation about Kemba and I hate it. Because to talk about why this team is one piece away, I have to talk about how Kemba wasn't as important on the court. I have to talk about how a team that was originally built around him and his style didn't need Walker to actually run said style. A team that prepared for his departure still suffers the stench that came with him being on the team for so long. 

Kemba Walker wasn’t an easy player to build around. It took him a while to develop his style in the association. Coming out of college, he was known for his highlights and his ‘cardiac Kemba moments’—even though I personally prefer to call him a crafty opportunistic guard, searching for comfort behind the arch. When the lights were at their brightest, he shined, it doesn't mean that the lights were shining all of the time.


When he entered the league, he was still as raw as could be. His shooting splits were poor, it felt as he was searching for guidance from someone else rather than creating his own way.


But on October 30, 2014, the Charlotte Hornets decided to take the risk.  After being a key member of the 2013-14 playoff team, he would be rewarded. They would extend Walker for his upside and would take the gamble of building a team around the young guard, with the hopes that he can turn on the lights in Charlotte.


It was a shame that the team never truly figured out what they needed to be. At glimpses, it felt that the team needed to develop around the arch—taking advantage of Kemba Walker’s ability to penetrate. Other times, it just felt as if the team was building around the two-man game—pairing Kemba Walker with the likes of Al Jefferson, Bismack Biyombo and Dwight Howard, with the occasional outside looks. 


The lack of definition wouldn’t get answered for sometime, experimentation simply lived on while Kemba Walker reaped the benefits of little-to-no expectations of team success but all of the credit for his personal success. Over time, the front office searched for answers. The city was puzzled, searching for hope. 


The Summer of 2017 provided that. Malik Monk and Dwayne Bacon would join the team at what felt were steal values. the team would trade for Willy Hernangomez and quietly, they would become one of the youngest teams in the NBA. There was a light at the end of the tunnel. The organization was ready for the change--Rich Cho and Steve Clifford were gone, a new front office was built and it seemed like the fresh start needed.

A team that was years in the making finally, existed. There was meaning to the team. 

There were three things that we learned last season about the Hornets:

1. Nicolas Batum wasn’t a Small Forward—even though he had been telling us this for some time and the Hornets coaching staff didn’t care. He’s an oversized shooting guard. This move allowed a lot of flexibility not in just who could be the 1 but how they could develop out the 3-role.

2. The team needed to be effective from behind the arch—they went from 27.2 3-point attempts per game to 33.9 attempts per game and utilized their perimeter based system.

3.  The team didn’t need Kemba Walker

The team progressed in a lot of different aspects. Different looks with Tony Parker, Devonte’ Graham, Malik Monk guiding the offense provided flexibility—something that had been missing since the last time Jeremy Lin was on the roster. 

It was also the style of offense without Walker that was appealing. Walker is so reliant on his handles opening the court that at times, we forget how pleasant it is for passing to open the offense. His score first mentality at times would rejuvenate a crowd but other times, a guard setting-up his teammate for the moment. He ranked 18th among guards in assist per game, assist % and double-doubles among guards—which was kind of surprising given is 31.5% usage rate, 6th among guards in 2018-19. He scored points—25.6 per game, 1.25 points per shot and took the second most shots by a guard (1684), which I guess explains it. 


The point, I guess, is that it feels like any guard could have been in that system and succeeded. If you’re getting the opportunities to take a lot of shot, if you’re working with a take on the two-man game that opens you up for a shot while others remain around the arch and space the floor extremely, it feels like most guards would love that system and most above-average guards would flourish in said system.

I don’t think anyone is surprised that Kemba Walker left and it felt like Charlotte has known for sometime. It developed a system where someone could come in and pick-up the slack or possibly develop others. It also explains their drafting decision in 2019—PJ Washington, Jaden McDaniels, two terrific scorers and Cody Martin, who showed offensive potential at Nevada. They didn't go after a fresh point guard out of college.

Devonte’ Graham stepped up this season, filling the role Walker provided for so long and the role Terry Rozier hasn’t proven he can handle just yet. His ability to create on the drive was something Kemba never really sought—Kemba liked being a score-first guy on the drive—but [Graham has been great about doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nst8UQGIInU)—especially with the potential from three this team has. The team averages the 7th most made three’s a game and averages 35.5 attempts from behind the arch per game. Even better, Devonte’ himself has been incredible from three. So don’t just say Devonte’ is ‘Baby Kemba,’ he may be better. 


As a team, they’re much more sharing—going from 57.8% of field goals being assisted to 62.5% They’re also trusting their play behind the arch—we already talked about more attempts but 37.1% of their points are coming from deep. 

This team does have a lot of flaws. They are running a two-man game with a focus around the arch—similar to the Wizards offense back in 2017-18—so a lot of times, Rozier or Graham will bring up the ball and be met with a high screen while the remaining forwards sit in the corner. The remaining member trails, stopping at the arch--bracing for the outlet past or long rebound. And with how much this team likes to penetrate and pass, it leads to a lot of turnovers. Its a fatal flaw to the system because at times, you could get a killer shot alone win the corner or the ball gets thrown away because of a tough pass.

In games were the team loses, they’re actually getting the same amount of shots off, shooting extremely similar numbers from the field, but are shooting but are just 3.8% worse from three and are averaging 4.4 more turnovers a game. The system is flawed, its a live by the system and die by the system. Charlotte, unfortunately, has had to deal with a lot of games where Rozier is forced to make an extremely contested bucket or an extremely difficult outlet pass only few are able to do it on a consistent basis. This also doesn’t exclude games where Graham and Rozier don’t perform or have an off-night. Last night’s game against Atlanta was an unfortunate reminder that sometimes, a player simply cannot get buckets.


I would also be remiss if I didn’t say Charlotte’s defense still sucks. Kemba Walker’s departure hasn’t changed the lack of strength in the paint. They still cannot get a defensive rebound, don’t force turnovers, don’t contest when they turn it over and more importantly, aren’t being aggressive when they do try to contest a tough shot. Opponents shoot 48.8% on them but it goes relatively unnoticed as time of possession is often drawn out against them. Its still bad, nothing has changed, I just wanted to have that on the record. 

The Hornets are doing their best to remind everyone that they don’t need Kemba—they can still be entertaining, they can still show glimpses of being great and can still have a mediocre record. As the team matures, as the holes in the line-up become more defined, the system will become more efficient. The loss of Walker isn’t affecting the roster as hard as once though and it shouldn’t have been a surprise. 

As you give players more reps, they’re often to show better performances. Walker was a usage beast that took advantage on the opportunities given to him in Charlotte—it doesn’t mean it was the right thing for that team. Now with his departure, Miles Bridges, Devonte’ Graham, Malik Monk [(when he is actually played)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_HPWlmENzg) can showcase what they’re able to do. I don’t think PJ Washington would be seeing the bursts he has been if Walker is running that team. 


As a Maryland boy, I’m not supposed to say nice things about a team from North Carolina but here we are. An organization once considered to be the joke in the league is now one piece away from finally contending in the east. The search for their much needed dominant big man is a journey most have never been able to answer. But if they do, it could lead to something special.",nbadiscussion
1198,203,"Duncan Robinson is becoming the definition of ""Catch and Shoot"" player","Duncan Robinson is slowly becoming the definition of ""Catch and Shoot"" Player. This year, with his great shooting, he helped in pushing Miami to 4th position in the East.

Some raw numbers and data to begin with. Robinson is currently third in the entire NBA league in total threes with 216, with only Buddy Hield (225) and James Harden (261) ahead of him. With Duncan 5% and 7% respectfully, more efficient than them at three-point shooting. We can say with great certainty that Robinson is already an elite three-point shooter. And what 43.8% efficiency from a three-point range looks like can be best seen with his [shot chart](https://i.imgur.com/DLRxUTY.png), which is ""Red"" in all 3 point areas. I think it's a pretty good accomplishment when your weakest 3-point shot is ""only"" 37.93%...

Another piece of information that is perhaps more impressive than previous ones is that Robinson takes 87.7% of all field goals in form of three-pointers!!! The first following player (who played some relevant number of matches with some respectable minutes) is Ben McLemore, with 83.4%.

The reason why I said that the Duncan is the definition of the term ""Catch and Shoot Player"" is that out of the 477 triples that he took, as many as 404 come from ""Catch and Shoot"" actions!!! In the [second graph](https://i.imgur.com/5LphTUq.png), I have shown 3-point attempts from Catch And Shoot actions, and as you can see, Robinson convincingly leads the league in this aspect, with 51 more shots than Bertans and Covington. And despite so many attempts, he maintains an average of as much as 44.8%!

The skill (which is also a type of ""Catch and Shoot"" action) that allowed him to make such a huge leap in this season, and also the play that makes the Miami Heat such a great offensive team, is the shot from the ""Hand Offs"". So, as the name implies, it's a simple basketball action where one player hands the ball to a teammate who runs past him. If you watched any of Miami's games or even the highlights, you noticed that this action almost always takes place in such a way that Bam Adebayo hands the ball to Robinson, and also making a pick which Robinson uses and shoots the three-ball immediately. As you can see in the [third graph](https://i.imgur.com/NsOD8Lc.png), Robinson has the most attempts in the entire league from Hand Off actions, 130 of them. And with that he has by far the highest eFG% of all players (who have more than 35 shots in total through the season). This percentage is 68.5%!! If you don't know what eFG% is, the full name of that statistic is ""Effective Field Goal Percentage"". The reason why it is called that is that it takes into account the fact that three-point field goals count for three points while normal field goals only count for two points. The simple formula for calculating this value is (FG2M + 1.5 * FG3M) / FGA. So this huge percentage of 68.5% tells us what we have already stated, Duncan takes a lot of threes, with very high efficiency.

Having already touched on the killer duo of Adebayo and Robinson, I looked at who the top three-point shooters in the league were getting passes from in [this chart](https://i.imgur.com/6WFpFnG.png). So the Adebayo-Robinson combo is the second most in triples scored, just behind Lillard and McCollum. In the 11th place, there is a Butler-Robinson combination as well. Since these are not ""official"" assists but shots hit after a pass from the passer, there is a possibility that the player did not take the shot directly but did some dribbling, so the scored basket was not assisted. But in the case of Robinson, we can pretty certainly say that almost all of them came for the REAL assist, as 95.3% of all Robinson's three-pointers are assisted!

To conclude this entire post, we can only say how hard work, will, persistence and desire pay off. Because Duncan Robinson was a player who started his college career at Division III college, then moved on to Michigan, where he was not the main star of the team, as shown in the 2018 draft when he was not drafted. After that, he was working on his skill set in the development G-League, where he showed his potential and had an average of 21.4 points with as many as 4.8 threes per game with a 3pt percentage of 48.3% !!!! He topped that journey with a great transition to the NBA this year and he has shown how he is one of the best shooters in the league.",nbadiscussion

But what's more interesting is that with him off the court, they're still a net positive team (+7.8). That's extremely rare for a team with an MVP frontrunner. 

[This chart](https://imgur.com/cQKu0Fw) shows the on/off Net Rating for every team with an MVP winner since 2000-01, [which is as far back as play-by-play data goes.](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba) 

As you can see, most teams are a net negative when their MVP is off the court. The few exceptions include Derrick Rose's Bulls in 2011, James Harden's Rockets in 2018, and Giannis' Bucks last season. 

However, no team has ever been *this* good with their MVP off the court. 

The Bucks Net Rating of +7.8 when Giannis sits [would be third best in the NBA this season behind only the Bucks and Lakers.](https://stats.nba.com/teams/advanced/?sort=NET_RATING&dir=-1) 

For comparisons sake, the Lakers are +12.9 when LeBron plays and +0.1 when he sits. Meanwhile, the Rockets are +6.9 when Harden plays and -3.1 when he sits.",nbadiscussion
1200,205,Which of these famously injured stars would have blossomed into the best player and gave their team the most success?,"Injuries are one of the worst thing about sports and have clearly left a huge impact on the success of many teams.  There are a few in particular that really stand out to me for players that I really wish we got to see progress.  I'm interested in what others think about these players and which ones do you think would have been the best if they hadn't got bit by the injury bug or if they had an antidote that prevented the injury from devastating their career. 

Grant Hils horrendous Fila injury after averaging 26 points 6 boards and 5 assists at age 27. He was really a special player who blew past anyone who dare tried to guard him one on one and finished at the rim with tenacity every time he attacked which was basically every play. This guy was a complete player who did a little bit of everything. He had an elite basketball IQ and also a tireless work ethic slowly improving his range by perfecting his mid range before working on improving his 3 point shot which didn't happen until after the injury.  We might of actually got to see what his prime was with that last pistons season but I have a hunch he would have improved as a shooter and possibly had a MVP season. He came back from the injury and was serviceable but we were robbed of what could have been. 

Brandon Roy was a 20, 5 and 5 guy who was only 25 when he got hurt. Anyone who watched him knows what kind of potential he had and how lethal of a scorer he could be when he was on. He was such an efficient scorer who had the potential to be a great 3 point shooter and might have been a superstar in today league hurting for 2 guards. If he dosent get hurt and continues to develop with LaMarcus Aldridge they would have done some serious damage together and made some noise out west.

Penny Hardaway was that dude. Before he got hurt he was a 20 point scorer who dropped 7 dimes with 4 boards. He was extremely efficient shooting over 50 percent from the field and was on track to be a really good 3 point shooter before teams were shooting 3s on a consistent basis.  He was a rare player who had great size for a point guard and honestly wasn't even supposed to be point guard but he was so good with the ball in his hands that they gave him the keys to the offense and it worked. Along with Shaq he took his team to the finals after beating Michael Jeffrey Jordan in a playoff series before getting their ass handed to them by the rockets.  He was destined to be a success before the injury bug bit and Orlando's future took a turn for the worse. 

A big what if injury prevention goes to Jay Williams.  Yes that annoying squawk on ESPN had some serious game before a motorcycle accident changed the course of his life.  His stats are much less telling of his potential because he only played one season and was still figuring it out as a young point guard in a talented league.  Jay was one of the best college basketball players I've ever seen and was the type of player you watched and were certain they would be a great NBA player. He was extremely athletic and had the same type of hype that Chris Paul generated before his career ended. It would have been so interesting to see him battling with today's great point guards and to see what he would have done with a healthy body. 

Shaun Livingston is another point guard that people may have forgotten had the potential and expectations to be on the point guard mount Rushmore.  This dude was unbelievable coming out of high school as the number 2 player in the nation commited to Duke.  With his size (6 foot 8 point guard) and court vision he was going to revolutionize the position like magic did all those years back. Skipping college it was tough for a skinny 18 year old and his stats were not great before the injury but by age 21 despite playing on a historically bad franchise  he was starting to show that potential people thought he had in his third year. Unfortunately his gruesome knee injury destroyed that idea. They literally considered amputation in one of the most damaging injuries ever.  We got a glimpse of just how good he could have been in the second half of his career when despite the Injury destroying the explosiveness needed to be elite he still got shit done at the highest level on a championship team.He used his craftiness and length to punish defenders and helped the greatest team ever win a few championships as a backup to one of the 3 best point guards ever. If he never got hurt and was able to put his craft together with a much more explosive body then I truly believe he would have been one of the best point guards in the league during his prime age seasons. Think about what this dude accomplished after damagingevery part of his knee, tearing the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), and the lateral meniscus, badly spraining his medial collateral ligament (MCL), and dislocating his patella and his tibio-fibular joint. Yikes!

Greg Oden. The 7 footer drafted over Kevin Durant who never did anything in the NBA. The only thing you have to know is that drafting him over Durant might not have been a bad choice if he never got hurt. That's how good he was and how good he could have been. Durant is one of the 5 best forwards to ever play basketball and Oden probably would have been picked first by 90% of the teams that year.  He was an elite defender who could actually guard all positions at his size. That is an insane thing to think about considering his size.  He was so freakishly fast and so much quicker then he looked.  He was extremely strong and had great defensive instincts.  He also got it done in the post and had all he tools to be a Tim Duncan like technician from the low post. He would have made things very interesting in the west especially if Brandon Roy was his teammate.  

To me Greg Oden is the obvious choice of the best player listed if he didn't get hurt. I think he would have been a DPOY candidate early in his career and a 20 and 10 guy for many many years.  Since the league doesn't have players like him he would have had such a huge impact and his defense would be similar to what Bam does now with better rim protection.  His injury is the biggest what if of all time in my opinion with maybe Arvydas Sabonis being the only one who is comparable.  I left Arvydas off this list because he is a bit older for most people on this sub and he ended up with a phenomenal career anyways but if he never hurt  his Achilles he may have lived up to the comparison of a 7 foot 3 Larry Bird.

1201,206,Who is the best player to never be the best player on their own team? A statistical view,"About 2 weeks ago, Celticsfor18th [posted the above question on r/nba](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hotqe6/who_is_the_best_player_to_never_be_the_best/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). Top guesses included Kevin McHale, Manu Ginobili, John Stockton, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson. The question intrigued me, and I sought to look at it first from a stats perspective.

I'd already gotten the Basketball-Reference stats for another project. I decided to use VORP (value over replacement player) as my criteria, as it *seems* to be the best all-in-one stat. However, this has the unfortunate side effect of cutting out players from before 1973 (that was the first season that VORP has calculations for). **I removed players who have played for less than 6 seasons, as they maybe haven't had the opportunity yet to lead a team** (this took out players like Donovan Mitchell and Nikola Mirotic).

Here are the top 10 players in VORP per season who have never led a team in VORP.

|Player|Seasons|Career VORP|VORP Per Season|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Kevin McHale|13|34.3|2.63846154|
|Draymond Green|8|19.7|2.4625|
|James Worthy|12|29.1|2.425|
|Dan Majerle|14|29.7|2.12142857|
|Detlef Schrempf|16|33.2|2.075|
|Horace Grant|17|32.8|1.92941176|
|DeAndre Jordan|12|23|1.91666667|
|David West|15|27.6|1.84|
|Sam Perkins|17|31.1|1.82941176|
|Klay Thompson|8|14.1|1.7625|

As you can see, Stockton and Ginobili don't show up. Ginobili apparently led the Spurs in VORP in 2008 (All-NBA 3rd Team and 6 VORP to Duncan's All-NBA 2nd Team and 4.8 VORP) and 2011 (All-NBA 3rd Team and 4.5 VORP to Duncan's 3.5).

John Stockton had 4 years of being the team VORP leader.

* 1988: All-NBA 2nd-Team with Malone (7.6 to 2.9)
* 1989: All-NBA 2nd-Team, but Malone got 1st Team (8.3 to 5.9)
* 1995: All-NBA 1st-Team with Malone (7.9 to 6)
* 2002: Neither made All-NBA, but Malone was an All-Star (4.8 to 4.4)

In terms of active players, **Dray and Klay** have spent their entire careers with Steph, while **DeAndre Jordan** was always in the shadows of CP3 & Blake Griffin.

**Kevin McHale** spent his all but his rookie and final seasons flanking Larry Bird. The best case McHale has is the 1989 season when Bird only played six games.

* McHale was All-Defense 2nd Team, averaged 22.5 points and 8.2 rebounds on 56.5% shooting,  and accumulated 3 VORP
* Robert Parish was All-NBA 3rd Team, averaged 18.6 points and 12.5 boards on 58% shooting, and accumulated 3.8 VORP

**James Worthy**'s entire career (save one season) overlapped with Magic

* both of Worthy's All-NBA 3rd team selections coincided with a 1st Team selection for Magic
* the one season without Magic, he was the singular all-star for the Lakers but point guard Sedale Threatt (15 points and 7 assists) led the team in VORP

**Detlef Schrempf** didn't really get going until his fifth season in the league

* Schrempf spent all four of his Indiana seasons beside Reggie Miller and all 6 of his Seattle seasons flanking Gary Payton
* He was All-NBA once with the Sonics, but his 1995 3rd team was overshadowed by the fact that Kemp and Payton were both 2nd team

**Horace Grant** spent the majority of his prime with the Jordan Bulls and Shaq Magic

* His only all-star appearance was in 1994 (the first year of the first Jordan retirement), but Scottie Pippen was still on the team and picked up a 1st team All-NBA selection
* The next best chance for Grant is 1998. Shaq had left in the offseason and Penny Hardaway only played 19 games.
   * Grant averaged 12 points and 8 rebounds shooting 46% from the field
   * Nick Anderson led the team in scoring with 15.3 per game shooting 45% from the field
   * Bo Outlaw averaged 9.5 points, 7.8 rebounds, 1.3 steals and 2.2 blocks while also leading the team in VORP

**Sam Perkins** was never an All-Star

* He spent his first 6 seasons with the Rolando Blackman & Mark Aguirre Mavs, 2 seasons with the Lakers (the first with Magic and Worthy, the second with just Worthy) and the rest of his prime with the GP & Kemp Sonics

**Dan Majerle** had 3 All-Star seasons, two of which overlapped with Charles Barkley

* both Majerle (17/6/3 on 48% FG and 38% 3P) and Jeff Hornacek (20/5/5 on 51% FG and 44% 3P) made their first All-Star Game in 1992

**David West** spent all 8 of his seasons in New Orleans as a CP3 sidekick, the first season of his Indiana tenure as a Danny Granger running mate and his subsequent Indiana seasons in a supporting role to Paul George.

Taking all this into account, my choices for top 5 players who were never the best players on their team:

* Stockton (despite VORP saying otherwise)
* Draymond
* Klay
* Detlef Schrempf
* Dan Majerle

I think McHale has a case for 1A/1B with Parish in 1989 and same for Ginobili with Duncan in 2011. (Edit: add Worthy and Sedale Threatt in 1992)

1202,207,"If everyone was in their prime, would the 2017-2018 Cavs be one of the better all-time teams?","TBH is everyone on the roster was in their prime and healthy, the team would win over 73 games and beat GSW's record. The starting 5 would consist of:

2010 - 2011 **DRose** (MVP)

2008 - 2009 **DWade** (Scoring Champ)

2014- 2015 **Kyle Korver** (Lead the league in 3PT% at 49.2%)

2012 - 2013 **Lebron James** (MVP and Finals MVP)

2013 - 2014 **Kevin Love** (Averaged 26 12 and 4)

Even the bench wouldn't be bad since it would consist of:

2016-2017 **Isaiah Thomas** (All NBA First-Team)

2012 - 2013 **J.R Smith** (Sixth Man of the Year)

2016 - 2017 **Jae Crowder** (Shot 40% from 3PT and was a very good defender)

2010 - 2011 **Channing Frye** (Above average player for his time, and a good 3PT shooter (40%))

2019 - 2020 T**ristan Thompson** (Above Average Center averaging 12 and 10)

&#x200B;

This team would work well I believe since Wade and Lebron spent those years in Miami, Drose and those 2 would've teamed up if Melo didn't decide to chase a bag in NY, and Kyle Korver would be the Steve Kerr to them, a 3pt specialist to go to in the clutch. The bench is extremely solid, lacking forwards and centers, but this can be overlooked by the backcourt, which would score tremendously off the bench.

EDIT: Due to the popularity of the post, and all the teams that have been discussed in the comments, I will make a subsequent post that will list 32 of the ALL-TIME Prime teams. With these teams in mind, I will try to get someone that can build the roster in 2k20 and build a MyLeague simulation of the teams.

1203,208,What do the Spurs do with DeMar Derozan?,"He’s 29 years old and entering a contract year where he can be a free agent next summer. He had a decent first year with the Spurs, but their direction is head scratching. They aren’t really a top contender in the deep Western Conference, but they’re not a bottom feeder either. They put up a good fight against the Nuggets in the playoffs and should be healthier this season. But LaMarcus Aldridge has a deal that keeps him through 2021 and he isn’t getting any younger. The roster around them is filled with young guys. Unless Derozan just feels comfortable in San Antonio after two years, I don’t see any reason for him to stay in an average situation while teams like the LAs, Houston, Denver, Utah, and Portland continue to improve. 

Needless to say, the Spurs are in a bit of a quandary. Do they try to keep DeRozan on board and sell him on settling down long term? Do they realize he could leave for nothing and trade him at the deadline to get younger? Do they still try to convince themselves as one of the best teams in the West? 

Derozan is still a really good player, but I don’t know how the Spurs keeping him for five more years potentially does any good. His game isn’t modernized, he’s not a good floor-spacer, his defense is so-so, and he could be a rental. Their team is younger, but he’s at a competitive stage in his career. So what will they do with him?",nbadiscussion
1204,209,Any predictions on how successful the heliocentric offense will be?,"It seems like a lot of teams are going towards the ""one player does everything"" heliocentric style of play. This includes teams like the Bucks, Mavs, Rockets, and to a certain extent the Blazers and the Hawks.

But there's not really any history of this style of play successfully producing championships aside from LeBron's one ring and finals trips with in the second Cavs stint. Even then, Kyrie handled the ball a decent amount of the time.

So far it seems like these team are doing really well in the regular season but get a bit exposed in the playoffs since their offense is so predictable. Obviously it's way too early to come up with a conclusion about how it will go for the Mavs though.

Do you guys think this style of play will start producing rings soon or is it just a great way of raising a team's floor? Will offenses geared more towards versatility and motion be more successful?",nbadiscussion
1205,210,Who are the best defensive players that never won DPOY?,"Here I ranked every active player that has been named all-defense at least 3 times in their career, but has never won DPOY:

1. Chris Paul

2. Anthony Davis

3. LeBron James

4. Paul George

5. Jimmy Butler

6. Serge Ibaka

7. Rajon Rondo

Here is my ranking of every player all-time to be named all-defense at least 6 times in their career, but never won DPOY:

1. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar

2. Tim Duncan

3. Scottie Pippen

4. Bobby Jones

5. Chris Paul

6. Kobe Bryant

7. Jason Kidd

8. Dennis Johnson

Current guys like AD, Giannis, and Embiid still have time to win DPOY, while CP3, LeBron, Ibaka, and Rondo are all past their defensive primes.

All-time, Kareem, Duncan, and Pippen are solidly the top 3 players to have never won DPOY. Unless Giannis or AD go their entire career without winning, that top 3 is probably safe. Even then I'm not sure Giannis and AD are better defenders than Pip.",nbadiscussion
1206,211,My Case for John Collins,"John Collins, in my armchair opinion, is one of the League's up and coming bigs, with potential to be a perennial Allstar and potential All NBA threat. 

With that being said, I also think John Collins is both under-appreciated and under-watched. 

John Collins was drafted 19th in the 2017 draft to a Hawks in turmoil. Coach Bud was gone or out the door, Horford had snaked us, thabo hadnt recovered amazingly, korver was gone or soon to be gone, and we had just traded teague. Dwight Howard and Paul Millsap started ahead of him at the 5&4, and he made a good impact as a starter and off the bench, and was solid enough to make the 2nd rookie team averaging 10.5/7.3 in 24 minutes. 

Enter his 2nd year, and he is a starter when available. We had just drafted Trae Young, and were not a good team, as we were in our first year of officially retooling while remaining competitive ™️. Starting in 59 of 61 games he was available and increasing his minutes from 24-->30, he averaged 19.5/9.8, with .6 blocks and shooting a whopping 61% from 2. While his defense was extremely poor, JC was shunted into the 5&4 roles interchangeablely, with no real perimeter or inside defensive studs surrounding him. 

Enter his 3rd year, and The Baptist has noticeably bulked up + aswell as developed a very smooth jumper during the offseason. The infamous PeeGate happens, popping The Baptist Collins and Dirty Pee Ayton, and he misses 25 games to start the season, and everyone forgets about him.

At age 22, John Collins started in the 41 games he was available for, after aforementioned PeeGate, and upped his minutes and production across the board. While the Hawks were admittedely still ""Retooling While Remaining Competitive™️"", with the youngest roster getting minutes in NBA history **and** randos + 40 year Vince Carter as the supporting cast to fill out the roster, Trae Young and John Collins absolutely balled out. Ice Trae had 29.6/9.3 and got the allstar pick, and John Collins was merely top 20 in: fg% (10th in league, 3rd time in career), offensive rebounds (14th in league, 2nd time in career), 2 pt fg% (5th in league, 3rd time in career), rebounds per game (15th in league, 1st time in career), player efficiency rating (13th in league, 1st time in career), true shooting (5th in league, 3rd time in career), effective field goal % (6th in league, 3rd time in career), offensive rebound % (19th in league, 3rd time in career), total rebound % (18th in league, 2nd time in career), block % (16th in league, 2nd time in career), offensive rating (12th in league, 2nd time in career), and finally offensive box plus minus (18th, 1st time in career)

In 41 starts, the hawks won 15 games and lost 26. In those 41 games, he had 22 double-doubles, 21.6 points per game (career high), 10.1 rebounds per game (career high), with .8 steals (a career high), 1.6 blocks, (a career high) with shooting splits of 58/40/80, all career highs in both attempts per game as well as percentages. 

The hawks have finally decided John Collins is a 4, with the trades for Dedmon, an old team captain and defensive anchor + capella, another defensive anchor and elite rim runner. 

Heading into this offseason and into the coming season, a stated goal was for an increase in efficiency (somehow) and shots, while also wanting to focus on sporting an improved handle. Management wants to add a pullup game to his repertoire, and with the focus and determination John Collins has repeatedly shown, I do not see it as out of the realm of possiblity. 

With John Collins' public desire of the max, he will need to be as focused and determined as he has ever been in his career up until now. With the addition of yet another top lottery pick, another offseason to synergize with Ice Trae Young and his teammates, a free agency to bolster the roster, John Collins is in a prime spot to take over the league by storm the next season, no one realizes it, and it's happening **right in front of your face**. His detractors may Harp on his defense, but he now has an entire offseason to focus entirely on his natural position for defense, which last season was merely average at worst. 

TL;DR - John Collins is absolutely Bananas and you're missing out by not watching him Baptizie fools + our jerseys are sick.",nbadiscussion

1209,214,"Who are the best players in league history that won a ring, but were never the best player on a championship team?","You probably know most of the greats that never won a ring (Stockton, Malone, Barkley, Nash, etc.), but what about the all-time greats that were never the best player on a title team despite winning a ring in their career? Here's my attempt at listing a top 10:

1. Oscar Robertson

2. Julius Erving

3. Jerry West

4. David Robinson

5. Elgin Baylor

6. Scottie Pippen

7. Jason Kidd

8. Kevin McHale

9. Elvin Hayes

10. Gary Payton

Honorable Mentions: Clyde Drexler, James Worthy, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, Robert Parish, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili


Jerry West was a tough one. He and Wilt finished 2nd and 3rd respectively in MVP voting in the ‘72 season. In the playoffs Jerry averaged 23/5/9 to Wilt’s 15/21/3, but with Wilt grabbing Finals MVP, that was enough of a tie-breaker for me to put Jerry on this list.

That ‘72 Lakers season also calls into question if Elgin Baylor should even be eligible for this list. Baylor only played 9 games in the  1971-72 season before retiring, and while the Lakers still gave him a ring, there’s an argument that he was never really on a championship team in the first place.

Note: I didn't just assume the Finals MVP was the best player on the team that year. Steph Curry for example was clearly the Warriors best player in 2015 despite Andre Iguodala winning Finals MVP.",nbadiscussion
1210,215,"An Overwritten, Too Long Remembrance of the Early 2000s New Jersey Nets — One of the NBA’s Most Forgotten Great Teams","Before Jason Kidd would stumble to find his footing as a coach, before Richard Jefferson would be come of the most beloved sports media personalities, before Vince Carter would join the two and outlast all of them, there was quite arguably one of the most forgotten good team in NBA history — the early 2000s New Jersey Nets. A team that I was mesmerized by growing up — partially because Jason Kidd being the cover art for *NBA Live 2003* which was the best of the franchise, partially because of the weird ESPN commercial with Jason Kidd at the free-throw line, blowing a kiss to his wife that later became awkward following Kidd admitting to assaulting his wife. 


Their story is forgotten due to the competition they would face, however they arguably deserve at least a  paragraph in the history books.


—


We always hear the phrase, “Thank God social media wasn’t around when I was growing up and maturing.” Jason Kidd probably agrees. A tremendous point guard, his young career centered around the thought of being the savior of a program. He would go to  his home college of Cal Berkley—a surprising choice given the recent history of the program. He would get Lou Campaneli fired as a freshman, only to bring in  future bag-dropper Todd Bozeman. He would go second overall — which probably pissed him off — to a Dallas Mavericks team that produced the worst record the year prior. He would help the team rebound to a 36-46 record and he would earn an all-star spot in 1996 however would also be traded due to the devil’s thruway between Kidd, Jim Jackson and the Dallas Maverick coaching staff.


He would join a Phoenix Suns team where again, he would immediately make an impact. The team’s record would improve by 16 games thanks to the small ball approach taken on by Danny Ainge, who would produce a line-up with Jason Kidd and the rookie Steve Nash. But Nash only played 10.5 minutes a game in his first season and it was mostly the work of Kevin Johnson, Sam Cassell and Jason Kidd. 


However, the Phoenix Suns would never achieve the success the team desired. Tinkering with line-ups, making adjustments to the back court to find the right match for Jason Kidd, they simply couldn’t create the perfect line-up. it would frustrate members of the team, frustrate the front office and more importantly, frustrate Jason Kidd once again. The final straw would be reached as Kidd would be charged with domestic abuse during the 2000-01 season, the Suns would need to hit the reset button and Jason Kidd would be shipped off to New Jersey. 


Meeting Jason there would be, Kenyon Martin in his second year, rookies Richard Jefferson and Jason Collins and then the two veterans Kerry Kittles and Keith Van Horn. The group of misfits would immediately go from laughing stock into championship contenders, something that was baffling at the time. 
  

Byron Scott structured his team around the ‘Princeton Offense.’ Allowing Kidd and Kittles to run the offense in tandem while also have a finger in nearly every single play was best for business. It would later lead to frustration, because Jason Kidd couldn’t shoot the ball so when he was in off-ball situations, he was limited, but that’s a different story for a different time. Keyon Martin was showing why he was a first overall pick and Jefferson was a spark-plug while showing potential as a scorer. Even though, [his attitude on the court wouldn’t be well received as he was still a rookie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZME4lTWBHY).


The Nets would enter the play-offs, seemingly going through the gauntlet of tough teams — and the Charlotte Hornets. 


They would start with the Indiana Pacers, in an incredible series that would feature a battle between Martin and peak Jermaine O’Neal, as well was Kidd versus Reggie. I still keep a recording of the Game 5 double-OT match-up, featuring incredible plays like the [Reggie Miller dunk to tie](https://youtu.be/FyEuOlPwGN4?t=3639) or the [ridiculous buzzer beat to tie off the Richard Jefferson’s choke job](https://youtu.be/FyEuOlPwGN4?t=3027).

Their second series against Baron Davis and the Charlotte Hornets wouldn’t have the same battle however would also feature an amazing game 5.

And then, the conference finals that was overshadowed by that western conference finals--you know the one, they would outlast the Boston Celtics in 6 games—fighting off comeback after comeback attempt. It was also cemented by the biggest shot in New Jersey Nets’ history — [the Keith Van Horn 3-pointer from the top of the key in game 6](https://youtu.be/FyEuOlPwGN4?t=3027).


But then, their magic disappeared. In the finals, what felt like would be a story booking ending to their turnaround  year, the Los Angeles Lakers would smash their dreams. Shaquille O’Neal would outmatch the big men on the Nets, Kobe would do Kobe things. The Nets simply were defeated by greatness. It was a gut punch, a reminder that not every story has a happy ending. They were exposed about their weakness in the 5 and the Princeton Offense looked out of place.


It felt like things would get better though. They were young, green and more importantly, Jason Kidd was entering free agency the next summer so they had to succeed or else he would leave. The lack of a better big men was  supposedly fixed by a 36 year old Dikembe Mutombo, Richard Jefferson would take on a bigger role with the team, it felt like Lucious Harris was still one of the best — if not the best — 6th man in the league, and they also had Brian Scalabrine. It had to work. 

They would still win the Atlantic division and once again, felt like they could make another run. In the play-offs, it felt easier. They would fight off the Payton - Cassell - Redd Bucks in six, shaking some of the nerves off in what was a rocky series. They would sweep their next two opponents - a Detroit Pistons team that was a year away and a Boston Celtics team stuck in, “should we blow it up mode or what should we go after” territory. 


Then, came the San Antonio Spurs. 


The then ‘Twin Towers’ system around Tim Duncan and the David Robinson had been needing a breath of fresh air. Despite winning a championship in 1999, they would struggle against modern views on the game. They would lose to Phoenix in 2000, the Lakers in 2001, Lakers again in 2002. They were simply outmatched.


However, new faces would make their appearance into the mold of things between 2001 and 2002—the names we associated with the dynasty: Manu, Tony Parker, Bruce Bowen, Stephen Jackson. While still displaying a resemblance to their old game, it would be with a fresher look and Tim Duncan would finally play the center--even though no one wants to admit that Tim Duncan was a center. 


In what felt like a Japanese wrestling match, both teams would battle with technical bliss mixed with physical play, paying homage to both the old and the new style of the game. [Dikembe would put the moves on Tim Duncan](https://youtu.be/XZBtA32q9rI?t=192), [Duncan would respond by nearly murdering the old man](https://youtu.be/kmpZh1l0hV4?t=108). But at the end of the day, the Nets would fall short once again. Tim Duncan would carry the Spurs across the finish line while Dikembe could barely walk. Jason Kidd would wonder what else he could have done to bring a title to New Jersey.


That off-season would change the future of that franchise. Jason Kidd would chicken out of a move to San Antonio in the final seconds, opting to sign a massive contract to stay while ownership attempted to sell the team. Dikembe would be bought out of his contract and the team would bring in Alonzo Mourning to fill the hole. However, it would be start to the internal discourse that would plague the team for years to come as Mourning didn’t appreciate getting rid of Dikembe. Then again, Alonzo Mourning wouldn’t see the court enough to understand the possible impact of Dikembe due to Mourning’s kidney disease complications.


With a slow start to the season, previous frustrations that were hidden through their play-off hot streak came back to light. More specifically, Jason Kidd was once again unhappy with his head coach. The Nets would do their best to hide the internal struggles to the media and would once again, look to re-create a spark. They were leading the Atlantic division prior to the departure of Scott but once again, they got hot—probably because Kenyon Martin would be playing for his resume and Richard Jefferson once again was improving his game. 

Despite being 14 games back from the Eastern conference leaders, the Indiana Pacers, they were once again the 2-seed—because of the stupid conference systems—but were arguably the third best team behind the Detroit Pistons. They would make quick work of the New York Kicks in a sweep. And then again, they were up against a team with an elite center.


The 'men-at-work’ Pistons were as previously mentioned, a year away last year. This time, they were here to play. Games 1 through 4 would all feature blowouts — with teams winning by a margin of 15 or more points. In what was a brutal, physical series all around the Nets would lose in 7 games. It was such a bad beating in game 7 that Larry Brown opted to sub in Darko Milicic during the final minutes — having only played 7-minutes in 4 games that post-season. 


The team would never reach the same heights. They would trade away Kenyon Martin — which irked Mourning yet again—but would bring in Vince Carter following his Toronto campaign to get out. . However, due to a Richard Jefferson injury, Carter and Kidd would fight for a play-off spot but felt like a wasted attempt. They would return to the top of the Atlantic division in 05-06—which felt like one last gasp for an finals opportunity for the franchise. 


Vince Carter and Richard Jefferson would struggle to find their strokes in the play-offs, the magic of Jason Kidd seemingly was beginning to finally fade. And it truly felt that this was the era was over. 

--
A team that reached heights no one truly expected never could finish the deal. No one expected them to be contenders yet they were — which makes their story so tragic. A team with gifted guards and underrated forwards failed to complete their roster with the 5th man they truly needed. In an era where a dominant big man was needed, they simply lacked it and never found it.


Yet the spectacle of watching the team was something I simply loved to watch. The brilliance of Kidd, the spectacle of Richard Jefferson, the power of Kenyon Martin, the archetypal role player in Kerry Kittles and even the years of peak Vince Carter. Its a brutal reminder to go all-in with a favorable hand and favorable circumstances and a brutal reminder of what happens when you miss your window. It was a series of unfortunate of events.",nbadiscussion
1211,216,Giannis's Supporting Cast vs Lebron's Supporting Cast,"First things first this isn't a MVP discussion, that's Giannis. I've noticed though that whenever people would have MVP debates they would always say Lebron has a better supporting cast solely due to Anthony Davis and I understand the logic because AD is amazing but the gap between AD and Middleton isn't as big as the gap between the Bucks 3-10 vs the Lakers 3-10. 

Lakers without Lebron turn into a negative team in most cases, while the Bucks are still a positive team without Giannis in most cases.

Lebron Off: 

910 Minutes -1.46 NetRating Reg Season

96 Minutes -8.84 NetRating Playoffs 

Lebron Off w/AD on:

160 Minutes +1.58 Net Rating Playoffs 

Giannis Off w/Khris On:

526 Minutes +9.63 Net Rating Reg Season

Avery Bradley (not in bubble but should be included)


What obviously inspired this post was how impressive Milwaukee was in Game 4 against the Heat. I always thought they had a better supporting cast than the Lakers. That performance got me thinking there is no scenario were that doesn't end up being a blowout if that was Lebron who got injured early in the Game like Giannis. 

Give me your thoughts, what you disagree/agree with. Whose supporting cast would you rather have between Giannis and Lebron?

1212,217,[OC] Who's the most contrarian voter in the history of public awards ballots?,"A couple of weeks ago, I read u/llewellynjean's [wonderful piece](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ix06rb/oc_ranking_all_100_media_members_who_vote_on_the/) on ranking this year's NBA awards voters by how contrarian their ballots were. I'd also read his [post](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/c65eyx/oc_i_combed_through_every_nba_award_ballot_from/) last year, where he'd continued [the work](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6jvot6/i_was_bored_and_analyzed_the_allnba_and/) of u/TroyAtWork the year prior. It got me curious about what the most contrarian ballot has looked like and who the most contrarian voters have been since the publication of ballots began in 2014.

First, I had to gather all the ballots, which was an undertaking in and of itself.

* the NBA publishes their ballots via PDF, which makes it much harder to scrape
   * for those interested, I used R's pdftools package and split columns based off two or more spaces, and then brute-forced error-checking in Excel
* the links to the [2014 voting results](https://official.nba.com/2014-nba-year-annual-award-voting-results/) are dead on the official page, so I went looking for them on the Wayback Machine and fortunately, they were there
* The NBA's somewhat crappy at standardizing or even spelling voter names correctly across years: Michael Wilbon has been Mike Wilbon, Israel Gutierrez has been both Israel Gutierez and Israel Guttierez

With the ballots gathered (43143 different votes), it was time to dive in. Again, thanks to llewellynjean and TroyAtWork for the methodology refinement in prior years!

# Methodology

**italics and strikethroughs are my own changes**

* Andre Drummond received **one first place vote** for Defensive Player of the Year, which was worth 5 points. Since there are ~~100~~ *99 other* media members, Drummond received on average ~~0.05 points per media member~~ *0 points from the rest of the voting contingent*
   * credit to u/epoch_fail for the [original suggestion](http://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ix06rb/oc_ranking_all_100_media_members_who_vote_on_the/g65yiws/?context=3)
* Greg Logan of Newsday gave Drummond a first place vote for Defensive Player of the Year, which was worth 5 points.
* 5 - 0 (average) = 5 point differential (absolute value taken, higher values are ""worse"")
* To penalize votes that were especially contrarian, I took the squared value of each difference. That means giving Andre Drummond five points for Defensive Player of the Year when his average points per media member was ~~0.05~~ 0 would be a lot more ""contrarian"" than giving five points to Rudy Gobert, who finished third in the voting and had an average points per media member of ~~2.81~~ 1.86.
   * *I'm assuming the 2.81 figure was a typo on the original post*
* After I squared each result, I took the square root of the average difference between all the points awarded on a particular ballot and the average points the 100 media members awarded to those players on that ballot.
* To continue to use Logan as an example, he gave Drummond 5 points (Drummond received ~~0.05~~ 0 points per *other* media member on average), Whiteside 3 points (~~0.03~~ 0 points per *other* media member) and Giannis 1 point (~~4.32~~ 4.35 points per *other* media member).

**Drummond**: (5 - 0)^(2) = 25

**Whiteside**: (3 - 0)^(2) = 9

**Giannis**: (1 - 4.35)^(2) = 11.2225

**Average Deviation From The Consensus**: sqrt((25+9+11.2225)/3) = \~3.88

* I did this same calculation for every media member for every award (MVP, Rookie of the Year, Sixth Man of the Year, Most Improved Player of the Year, Defensive Player of the Year, Coach of the Year, All-NBA ~~First Team, All-NBA Second Team, All-NBA Third Team~~, All-Defensive ~~First Team, All-Defensive Second Team~~, All-Rookie ~~First Team, All-Rookie Second Team~~).
   * *I combined the end-of-season teams, so instead of three separate ballots for All-NBA 1st, 2nd and 3rd team, it was one ballot for All-NBA.*
* Lastly, I took the sum of all these average deviations from the ~~13~~ 9 awards to create what I'm calling a ""Total Contrarian Score""
* *another change I mulled, but ultimately decided not to implement was including all players who received a vote in a voter's contrary score and not just the players that the voter chose*
   * *this was mentioned in the comments of the previous post*
   * *the reason I chose not to do it is that it would just increase everyone's score AND it would feel like double-punishment (if a voter didn't have the eventual winner or second-place finisher on their ballot, chances are high that they went off the board)*

I'd like to reiterate a significant point from llewellynjean's post: **not all ballots that are considered contrarian are ""bad"" or indefensible**.

With the methodology out of the way, on to the results!

Why per ballot and per pick, rather than per year? Because a voter might not necessarily vote for all awards in a given year. The inclusion for per pick is reduce the skew of the end of season teams (All-NBA, All-Rookie and All-Defense), which have more spots.

1214,219,LeBron capped his postgame comments by talking about the heat theory of his five straight threes: “I guarantee that analytics person or people have never ever been in the zone in their lives.” https://twitter.com/kylegoon/status/1224933809981800448,"Lebron james has taken 287 3pa this year on 0.352 3pt shooting.

The chance of him making 5 in a row is about 0.0054 (0.352\^5)

He has had, this year 283 (287-(5-1)) possible chances to make 5 in a row, the probability of him doing it at least once is just 1- the probablity of not doing it once in 283 tries.

Probability of him not doing it once in 283 tries is the probability of him not doing it 0.9946 (1 - probability of him doing it) raised to the 283rd power.

1 - (0.9946 \^ 283) \~ 0.784

So, even if there was no 'zone' which i dont think is a common belief amongst analytics people, the chance of him doing it up to this point in the year in about 80%

EDIT: I FUCKED THIS UP, THANKS TO THE PEOPLE WHO POINTED THIS OUT!

I treated each attempt to get 5 in a row as an independent event, but thats not the case, when i actually run a simulation the probability comes out at \~0.63 every time

1216,221,Pistons fan looking for actual input,"We're in an awful spot. I'm painfully aware of that. With that said, I realized that I haven't heard an intelligent nba fan speak logically about the pistons bc we are completely absent from the media discussions (rightfully so). The extent of pistons discussion on TV and in podcasts is essentially just as a punchline, which again, I get.

With that said:  what do yall believe is a realistic 5 year trajectory? What do yall think are the biggest points of optimism and biggest concerns? What are your thoughts on Dwane Casey, Sekou, Luke Kennard, Blake, D Rose and the rest of the team?  Who do you think we should target in the draft.

1217,222,Who are the best players in NBA history that never won an MVP?,"Here's my go at ranking the top 20 players in league history that never won an MVP. I used a very simple, arbitrary formula to come up with these rankings. (all-NBA teams+1st team all-NBA)(top 5 MVP seasons+1)+all-defense. This is in no way perfect, but simply a made-up metric to measure these guys. It values peak over longevity, and uses defense somewhat as a tie-breaker. I also first came up with my own top 20 first, then ranked those guys using this formula, so there might be a player I didn't list that would have ranked higher using my formula.

|Rank|Player|All-NBA Teams|1st Team All-NBA|All-Defense|Top 5 MVP|Total Points|

|19|John Stockton|11|2|5|0|18|
|20|Carmelo Anthony|6|0|0|1|12|

I'm going to look at 4 point guards to try and somewhat justify these rankings. Chris Paul (6th), Jason Kidd (10th), Gary Payton (15th), and John Stockton (19th). While Stockton has an argument for having a better overall career than all these guys, he never really came close to winning an MVP, while all the others have at least 1 season where they were a top 5 player. Paul having 4 top 5 seasons puts him clearly above Kidd/Payton, and Kidd's 3 more seasons as a 1st team All-NBA player gives him the edge over Payton.",nbadiscussion
1218,223,Celtics Have Found Their Duo of the Future,"Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown have both had their breakout seasons this year.
Their usage has been increasing each year, and this year they are the leaders
of the Celtics' team in that aspect, along with veterans Hayward and Walker. However, unlike the latter two, Tatum and Brown are only 21 and 23 years old, respectively. Given that forwards are the centerpieces in most NBA teams, it seems like Celtics have a solid foundation for the future.

Jayson has emerged big time this season, earning first All-Star appearance with his
great performances, and he kept it going even after the All-Star break.
He capped off amazing February finishing with 30.7 points per game while averaging 49.4/48.1/76.9 shooting splits. That was enough to earn him his first Player of the Month award.

Jaylen wasn't far behind him, he averaged 21.8 points per game, with a bit worse percentages. But both of them picked it up big time with Kemba missing some time.

With all this in mind, how do they fit along with one another?

## Look at Shot Charts

[Tatum](https://i.imgur.com/geeb1TE.png) has ramped up the number of three-pointers this season, he almost doubled
the attempts per game (3.9 to 7.1), while even improving 3pt% by a little.

The thing that is interesting with Jayson is that he creates 55% of his three-point makes by himself (that isn't really visible on the shot chart, but it is useful info).

[Brown](https://i.imgur.com/s2yCE9f.png) on the other hand, is more focused on the paint and restricted area. However he isn't too shabby when it comes to three-pointers. Most of his triples come from corners, that's because he often defaults to spot up role in offense (more on that later). Brown excels in that role shooting almost 50% from both corners. But Jaylen is extremely efficient
when shooting 2 pointers, that percentage stands at 55.2%.


## Look at Scoring Based on Play Types

To compare their performance based on play types, I created a [Radar Chart](https://i.imgur.com/w7RoV5V.png). Or Spider
Chart, whatever name you like more. Anyway on this chart you can nicely see the profile of both of these players.

Tatum fits in the role of ""The Guy"" for the Celtics. Most of his points come from Isolation and Pick and Roll (where he is in the role of Ball handler). Tatum also leads the whole team in isolation points, however, the focus in Celtics isn't on isolation. The focus for the is Pick and Roll action, which is a basic type of play installed in their motion offense. The team leader in that segment is of course Kemba, but the fact that Tatum is averaging 6 points per game tells that he is very capable of running the pick and roll.

Jaylen Brown scores most of his points while spotting up. That number is a bit bigger than expected, but the fact that 88% of his three point makes is assisted explains it. And when needed, Brown can get near the hoop by either posting up, or driving to the hoop.

## Look at Scoring based on Tracking data

Once again we have another [Spider/Radar chart](https://i.imgur.com/rO1JfRn.png).

So this chart is based on ""Tracking"" data, as it says on [stats.nba.com](https://stats.nba.com/). It's pretty similar to previous chart and previous data but it gives a bit of a different look.

However, it is weird that Brown doesn't have 6 points per game in ""Catch and Shoot"" segment, because that is the amount of point he averages in ""Spot Up"" plays. So I guess that either tracking data has some errors (because this is automatically generated as far as I know) or the data based on plays has some issues. Or maybe some of the ""Spot Up""  points went to ""Pull Up Points"".

What we CAN see here is that Tatum pretty much evenly distributes the points that he created on Drives and Pull ups. And Brown tends to attack the rim more. So basically, we just confirmed the things already mentioned.

## Bright Future Ahead

If I were a Celtics' fan, I would be very happy with the situation of the team. Talented, young(er) coach who has a really beautiful offensive philosophy. Two very solid veteran players who can guide the team when needed. Great supporting cast which fits really well in today's basketball; Smart is an amazing defender and started to shoot the ball well. A smart center in Theis who is doing a lot of statistically unseen things in the offense, while being a solid defender. Also, his shot is steadily improving.

And then the youth core of the Celtics, Tatum, and Brown. The team will stay the same for 2 more seasons, after which Hayward becomes FA. However, with Brown already committed to long term contract, and Tatum without a doubt being maxed, Celtics probably won't have a problem creating a team around the two of them.

1219,224,"Karl Malone has two of the best shooting years from 16ft-3pt ever yet this all time shooting ability is seemingly never brought up in discussions about him, why is that?","The impression I have gotten of Karl Malone over the last few weeks of podcasts, reddit and tv is that Karl Malone primarily played and was mostly dangerous around the rim. I've heard he was lucky to play with such a facilitator as Stockton. 

In searching this subreddit I read a post where 2 or 3 people were explaining that Lamarcus Aldridge has been a much better and rangier shooter than Malone ever was. 

However, Malone's 96-97 and 97-98 seasons were all time great long 2 shooting years. He shot 52% on 1163 attempts. MJ in 97 shot 51% and 45% the next year. Dirk's highest from that range was 52% in 2011. KG never approached that efficiency or volume, averaging in the low 40%s for his career. KD averaged about 52% as well from 16-3pt for his GSW career. 

Clearly Malone was an all-time jump shooter for long 2s. A trait that is vauled vs good defenses in the playoffs and consideded a good indicator of 3pt shooting potential. Why is Malone not considerable a great shooter? What would Malone look like in today's game? I don't see why he wouldn't have been a great 3 point shooter other than his FT% being lucklaster.",nbadiscussion
1220,225,"Jonas Valanciunas against the Clippers without Kawhi today: 30 points, 16 Rebounds, 12/17 shooting, in 34 minutes of action. Will the Clippers be able to survive playoff series against teams with an All NBA bigs?","Whilst the clippers came away with the win in a tight game today on the second night of a back to back without Kawhi, realistically they should have been able to put the grizzlies away much sooner than they did. One major reason for this was JV's big game. Doc Rivers threw every defender he had at him today, and the Clippers were unable to find any answers.

JV had 30 points, 16 Rebounds, 12/17 shooting, in 34 minutes, with 7 offensive boards, and only one personal foul. He was +14 which was best in the game. 

Whilst adding kawhi will bolster the clippers' offensive output, and defense on the wing, he's not going to help much defending bigs like AD, Jokic, KAT or Embiid who are far more capable offensively than JV. How are the Clippers going to match those guys over a 7 game series?",nbadiscussion
1221,226,Reminder How Good the Bucks Were This Season," 

We're not even a week done and we're already seeing a lot of silly revisionism about how impressive the raptors have been. To dispel this silliness lets look at who they defeated in their most impressive win:  


2018-2019 milwaukee Bucks:  
\-> posted a top 30 all time srs  
\-> one of 7 teams to post 45 blowout wins(posted 46)  
\-> won 60 games  
\-> blew out 8 of ten po games before losing to the champs  
\-> Had the third highest playoff point differential before losing to the champs  
\-> One of 6 all time playoff teams to lower the other team's offence by 7+ points  


A grand total of zero teams with this resume had failed to win the title untill these playoffs. The raptors didn't win because the bucks weren't great, they won because they were great. 📷

1222,227,How Giannis Antetokounmpo's 2020 defensive season compares to some historically great defenders' peak defensive seasons,"I was curious to see how Giannis this season defensively stacked up against some historically great defensive players' peak defensive seasons. I decided to go for the top of the defensive mountain and chose to compare him to legendary defenders Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Draymond Green, and Ben Wallace. 

As a disclaimer, by no means am I saying Giannis is a better defender than any of these players. Not at all. And I am aware that it's challenging to really encapsulate a player's defensive impact through raw data. I just thought it'd be an interesting comparison. I was certainly amazed at how relatively similar all of their numbers were.

1223,228,"China, the FIBA World Cup and Human Rights","I should say from the start that I may be biased as I work in the field of human rights.

The relationship between the government of China and the NBA and basketball in general is a tricky subject. On the one hand, basketball is the most popular sport in China and will be very important for the overall growth of the sport in the future. It is very positive to see so many people passionate about the sport and generates a lot of income for the NBA and its players. The growing prominence of China in the field of basketball is also evidenced in the country currently hosting the 2019 FIBA World Cup.

However, the Chinese government's severe persecution of its people and horrendous human rights record makes this relationship and the hosting of the world cup a difficult issue. 

As the tournament progresses, democracy protestors in Hong Kong are being arrested and beaten  up by police, over 1 million Uyghurs are being arbitrarily detained in internment camps, lawyers and activists are being rounded up and tortured, Tibetans are seeing their language and culture being eroded and Chinese Christians face significant persecution and are being arrested for practicing their faith, among many other serious human rights violations.

In other tournaments or international sporting events, human rights concerns are regularly raised or addressed in some meaningful way. In Qatar, news outlets continue to raise the many serious abuses occurring. In an opinion piece today in the Guardian, Karim Abdul Jabbar wrote that athletes should raise civil rights and social issues, saying:

""It is an opportunity to do more than promote themselves for endorsement deals for clothing and their face on a box of Wheaties. It is a chance to let the world hear the rational voices that demand social justice, inclusion and protection of the marginalized and productive diplomacy.""

However, to my knowledge, not a single basketball player, NBA official or national basketball association has raised any human rights concerns in China in any way, despite the fact that policies from the Chinese government may amount to crimes against humanity. While basketball players historically (and currently) have been active in bringing about social change and pushing for equality and respect for civil rights domestically, there are few instances of any players applying the same concern to international issues. It seems that players are content to ""Shut up and dribble"" in China.

Why do you think that is? China's massive market and the numerous partnerships the NBA has with Chinese companies may play a role, but players should be less beholden to market forces.

Do you think athletes have a moral duty to use their platform to raise these concerns or is this best left to states and activists?",nbadiscussion

1225,230,"NBA Reddit prefers young players, and coaches that exceed expectations: a sentiment regression analysis","As both a Cavs fan and r/NBA reader, last year I noticed some interesting trends about Cavs coverage. Cedi Osman, despite being a rookie without much playing time, was called the “GOAT”; in contrast, Tristan Thompson, hero of the 2016 Finals, was constantly lumped into trade discussions with the Nets pick. Being a data scientist, I decided to quantify these comments, and figure out whether people liked Cedi because he was young, disliked Tristan Thompson due to his contract, or even if there was some sort of racial component to the discussion. To do this, I used a method called sentiment analysis to quantify opinion about players, and used regression to disentangle the factors. Here are the headline results:

* NBA Players

 * Reddit commenters like players who perform well; in the NBA, scoring 1 more PPG is worth approximately 0.02 standard deviations

 * Commenters particularly like both young players, and old players

 * There was no overall bias for or against black or white players

 * However, there was a interaction of scoring with race, where scoring points for white players 
is worth ~2-3x as much as for black players

* NBA coaches

 * The overall sentiment towards coaches was less than that towards players
 * One win above expectation was worth 0.06 standard deviations
 * There is a significant bias against black coaches in the NBA, worth ~10 wins

## Quantifying sentiment towards players

To get redditors opinions towards NBA players, I scraped r/NBA from 2013-2018. I then quantified each commenters opinion towards player using the sentiment analyzer VADER. This analysis calculates whether a word is positive (“GOAT!”) or negative, and ties that feeling to a player. Sentiment scores generally ranged from -0.2 to 0.3. Here are the highest and lowest player-seasons since 2013:

|   Lowest |Sentiment    | Seasons     | Highest   |Sentiment |Seasons|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Player |Year    | Avg Sentiment  | Player  | Year  | Avg Sentiment
| Mike Dunleavy  | 2016  | -0.11  | Brandon Ingram  | 2015  |0.27 |
| Kelly Olynyk  | 2016  | -0.08  | Karl-Anthony Towns  | 2015  |0.26 |
| Steve Blake  | 2015  | -0.07  | Marc Gasol  | 2014  |0.25 |
| Zaza Pachulia  | 2017| -0.07  | Gordon Hayward  | 2014 |0.24|

In general, these sentiment values pass the sniff test. Dirty players like Kelly Olynyk, and Zaza Pachulia each received their low score in seasons immediately following incidents where they injured high-profile players; Brandon Ingram and Karl-Anthony Towns in 2015 were young players with potential, and Marc Gasol is the franchise player of Memphis. For a full table of player sentiment, see this .tsv, where the column ‘compound_mean_mean’ represents player sentiment.

## Regression analysis

After quantifying how well liked each player was, we can then try to understand what factors drive their popularity. To do this, I used a regression model, where we can try to predict player sentiment using factors like performance (PPG, rebounds, assists), and demographic information (age, height, and race). I found that there was a significant correlation between scoring and sentiment, worth ~0.2 standard deviations for 10PPG. With that baseline, we can then quantify how much each other factor is worth in terms of PPG. Here are the significant coefficients for player sentiment (not shown are non-significant coefficients for rebounds, assists, salary, and more):

|Coefficient| Magnitude (PPG)|
|--|--|
|Rookie|22|
|1 year of youth (<27)|2.2|
|1 year of age (>27) | 1.2|
|Race|Not significant|
|PPG for white player|2.5x baseline PPG|

There are a few interesting things here. First, redditors love young players, especially rookies. My guess is that rookies are cheap and full of potential; we are willing to forgive their mistakes in the hopes they will improve. Second, redditors like older players. There is probably some selection bias here in that older players are usually former good players, and we have fond memories of them. For race, there was no overall bias for or against black or white players. However, we did find an interaction: scoring points was approximately 2.5x more sentiment for white players than black players. (In interpreting the interaction, think of it this way: there is no bias against white or black bench players. However, a white players scoring 10PPG would be roughly as popular as a black player scoring 25PP, all else being equal.)

## Analysis of NBA coaches

We can perform the same sort of analysis for NBA coaches. Here are the most popular and unpopular coach seasons from 2013-2108:


|  Highest   |Sentiment    | Seasons     | Lowest  |Sentiment |Seasons|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Coach|Year    | Avg Sentiment  | Player  | Year  | Avg Sentiment
| Brad Stevens  | 2014-2015| 0.3  | George Karl  | 2015-2016|-0.15 |
| Erik Spoelstra  | 2014-2015  | 0.26  | Earl Watson  | 2017-2018|-0.1 |
| Brad Stevens  | 2017-2018| 0.24  | Kurt Rambis  | 2015-2016|-0.1 |
| Steve Kerr  | 2014-2015| 0.23  | Fred Hoiberg  | 2015-2016|-0.06|

These lists generally make sense, as Brad Stevens, Erik Spoelstra, and Steve Kerr are well liked. We can perform a regression analysis for coaches as well, replacing scoring with wins. For coaches, like players, performance was correlated with sentiment, with one win above pre-season expectation worth ~0.06 standard deviations (e.g. if a team won 50 games, but was expected to win 45, they would have +5 wins over expectation). We can then think of all coefficients in terms of wins. Here are the significant coefficients for coaches:

|Coefficient|Magnitude (Wins above expectations)|
|--|--|
|Season Wins|-0.3|
|Career Win %|0.5|
|Age (years)|-0.6|
|Tenure with team (years)|1|
|Race (white)|10|

The negative coefficient for in-season wins is somewhat surprising. In thinking about this, it is important to think about how coach variables are correlated. For example, long-tenured coaches generally win more. My explanation for the negative in-season win coefficient is that many coaches who win a lot are expected to win, and likely have long tenure with a team. Similar to players, redditors like either young coaches, or coaches who have been with their team a while. Finally, for race we see a significant positive bias for white coaches. Anecdotally, I can think of many successful black coaches like Dwane Casey and Tyronn Lue that were criticized despite winning.

If you found this analysis interesting, I have written up a more [detailed essay](http://www.trailofpapers.net/2019/02/what-makes-athletes-popular.html) that explains the details of how the sentiment was calculated, how the regression was done, and includes more graphs and specifications.",nbadiscussion

Hey NBA discussion fam -  in this video analysis, I detailed the science and mechanics behind Bron’s single leg power jumping technique. Thanks to the mods for letting me post.

Here’s a table of contents, header (sub-headings):

\- 0:00 Intro

\- 0:35 Single leg power jump

\- 0:47 Mechanics breakdown

\- 1:50 Executes in variety of situations

For those at work or the hard of hearing, I've transcribed subtitles on YouTube so sound isn't required.

Summary: LeBron's vertical jump height has reportedly been measured as high as 44 inches which puts him in the upper echelon of NBA jumpers. When he's jumping off one leg, he uses a power jumping technique that emphasizes his lower body strength and coordination to translate horizontal force into vertical force. The key aspects of the power jump (and I detailed these in the video with call outs) are an elongated final step, powerful plant step, generating force in the amortization phase, a stretch-shorten cycle with his lower leg, maintaining an upright torso position, and coordinating his arm swing with his legs. What further separates Bron is his ability to execute the technique in a variety of situations - on both the offensive and defensive end (multiple examples in the video).

For reference, I’m a DPT and youth basketball coach well-versed in sports science and biomechanics, with sports rehab & performance clinics in LA. Feel free to hit me with questions.",nbadiscussion

1230,235,"When players are at the free throw line, why don't they try to intentionally hit the front of the rim intentionally to get the potential rebound and an extra possession?","We have seen this play in few situations( by Yao Ming, Steven Adams, Jayson Tatum to name a few on top of my head) . I was wondering why this isn't more common through the course of the game and not just in specific situations. This could *potentially* result in a lot of points in short time. 

When there are two free throws, make the first one and run this play on the second one. Sounds logical to me but I want to know why it's not.",nbadiscussion
1231,236,What is the oldest asset that is still linked to a current NBA roster?,"I don't know exactly how to phrase this question, but I was doing some digging around on Basketball Reference a couple weeks ago to figure out how the Bucks built their team.  One interesting thing I found is that there is a line of trades ultimately culminating in Mirotic and George Hill, that can be traced all the way back to Alton Lister, a player the Bucks drafted in 1981.

There's other assets involved but a simplified version would look something like:

Alton Lister (1981) > Sherman Douglas > Tyrone Hill > Kevin Willis > Dan Gadzuric (as a 2002 1st round pick) > Corey Maggette > Shaun Livingston > John Henson (as a 2012 1st round pick) > Jason Smith > Nikola Mirotic

George Hill was also acquired in the John Henson for Jason Smith trade.

So, is there another team that can trace the trade lineage of any of their current players back further than 1981?",nbadiscussion
1232,237,I think Kawhi should sign a 1 + 1 deal in Toronto and run it back. It'll be his best chance for a ring this year,"I think its an even bigger chance than he wins in Toronto than he does in LA. 

The reason why the Lakers are such a big risk are because of the lack of depth. If one of those guys goes down with injury, who's stepping up? Having 3 stars is great but i feel like having 2 stars and quality depth is better.

If he goes back to Toronto he'll have the same core, same great coach, and wont have to worry about chemistry issues. I do feel that the only team that is a serious serious threat to them is the Bucks. 

The Celtics got a bit weaker after Al and Kyrie left, the 76ers lack high level perimeter play after losing both JJ and Butler. and the Pacers success revolves on how well Oladipo bounces back from injury. 

So what about the Clippers. 

I feel the Clippers are a good team but their best player in Lou Williams is 32 and will probably start to see some decline within the next 4 years. Pat Bev is very good but hes no star, and Gallinari probably had his best season but is constantly injured. The young guys are good but will they be good enough to help pick up any slack from the veterans as they age?

So basically yea, if Kawhi wants to win another ring, stay 1 more year in Toronto and then you'll have the ability to enter free agency again to better analyze teams like the Lakers, Clippers, or any other team with cap space looking to sign him. Maybe theres a sleeper team in 2020 that shows great promise that could sign him.",nbadiscussion

1234,239,Who was the most disappointing player on your team this season?,"With the regular season finally having ended, let's talk about those dudes who didn't make their next step, regressed hard or just flat out sucked. Which player had the most disappointing season on your favorite team?

For the Raptors, the number one can only be Stanley Johnson. Even with some promising signs in the last couple of games, he showed very little during this year that makes you believe that he has a place in the league. Even though he'd have all the physical tools, his decision making, especially on offense, is just truly abysmal. He'll have a chance to prove himself again next year, since there's no way in hell he'll decline his 4M player option, but I'm sure he'll be out of the league if he plays like that again.",nbadiscussion
1235,240,Embiid v. Jokić,"I recently had a debate with my friends on who the best center in the NBA was. I said that I thought it was Jokić, saying that he was better than Embiid on offense by a good margin, and slightly worse on defense. My friends said that Embiid was better because he does most of the things traditional centers do better. I said that while that is true for some things, that’s not what makes him the best center. The best center isn’t the person that does those things the best, it’s the best player at the center position. I was wondering what other people think. Who do you think is better? Or is someone else the best center in the NBA and why?

Edit: Here is the link for the BR article that has some stats that reaffirmed my opinion: https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2888735-ranking-nbas-top-15-centers-this-season.amp.html",nbadiscussion
1236,241,Where would Giannis win the most Championships?,"Ok, so this post isn't meant to argue about where Giannis will end up, but more meant as a thought experiment looking solely at which of the rumored destinations would be the place where Giannis would likely win the most rings. We are not looking at what city he might prefer to live in, where he could make the most money (on or off the court), just chips.

So, without further ado, here are some of the most rumoured destinations, and the realistic cast they could have around Giannis:

Bucks

Players: Pretty much the current team (Middleton, Bledsoe, Lopez, etc), plus midlevels and draft picks, since they would be capped out. Middleton is currently 28, Bledsoe is 30 and Lopez is 31. DiVincenzo is the primary younger asset (at 23).

Coach and Management: Bud obviously is a pretty good coach, despite being a bit inflexible, while the front office seems solid.

Notes: Obviously, you can't argue too much with a team that is set to be the top seed in the league again this year. The criticism is that they lack a second superstar, but Middleton has made a case that he could be that guy. Bledsoe and Lopez are older, but both have games that should age pretty well, as they are not particularly dependent on athleticism.

Raptors

Players: Siakam, VanVleet (assuming he re-signs this summer), OG Anunoby, Norm Powell (has a 2021 option), Terence Davis. Powell and Siakam are the oldest of the group at 26, while VanVleet is 25, OG and Davis are 22. Lowry probably only fits if he will sign back on a midlevel, given the cap situation required to open up space for Giannis, while Gasol and Ibaka don't seem to fit the cap situation.

Coach and Management: Nurse is the COTY favorite, while the front office has an argument for being the league's best.

Notes: The core is positioned to be in their primes through the length of a theoretical Giannis contract. Assuming all the older guys are gone, that leaves a starting 5 of Giannis, Siakam, OG, Davis/Powell and VanVleet. Everyone in that lineup is an excellent three point shooter and an excellent defender, while Giannis and OG both have arguments for being the best defenders at their positions in the league. The lineup is also highly switchable on defence. 

Heat

Players: Jimmy Butler, Tyler Herro, Bam Adebayo, Kendrick Nunn and Duncan Robinson. Most of the core is young, and Giannis/Bam would make for a devastating front court, while Herro and Robinson provide great outside shooting. The only older player is Butler, who is currently 30, and would have just turned 32 at the start of his first potential season with Giannis, meaning some likely decline over the course of the contract years.

Coach and Management: Tough to argue too much with Spoelstra and Reilly. 

Notes: With the exception of Butler, the whole core should be in their prime during any potential Giannis years. The fit next to Bam defensively, is excellent, but the offensive fit could have spacing issues, since Bam is (at present) a non-shooter from three. They would still lack a traditional point guard in their starting lineup, but, that has worked pretty well this year with Butler and Nunn sharing the load, and Giannis initiates offence, too, so it should work by committee.

Mavericks

Players: Luka, Porzingis, Luka, Seth Curry, Luka, Maxi Kleber, Delon Wright, Luka, Jalen Brunson, Luka...ok, you probably get the point, combining the inside/outside games of Luka and Giannis, with Porzingis as the number 3, would be devastating. Porzingis is 24 and Luka is 21, so no issues with age, for the key guys.

Coach and Management: Rick Carlisle hasn't lasted 11 years by accident. He's pretty good. Management has been pretty solid, too.

Notes: It is tough to overstate how devastating of a big 3 this would be. There is a pretty good chance that Luka and Giannis would actually be the NBA's two best players for most, if not all, of the length of a Giannis contract. Meanwhile, Porzingis is an amazing fit, too. He's basically the player Brook Lopez wishes he was. There are few bigs who can protect the rim and shoot threes as well as Porzingis.

Warriors:

This one has some limitations to it, since it would need to be by trade. The theoretical trade I am assuming here is Wiggins, whoever they draft with their pick this year, that 2021 pick from Minnesota and maybe Eric Paschall.

Players: Given that deal, the key pieces left are Steph, Klay, Dray, Kevon Looney and Jordan Poole. Age is a factor here. Steph is 32 now, Klay is 30 and Dray is 30. I'm not too worried about Steph. He will probably lose some on-ball value and quickness, but his shooting should age very well. We obviously don't know how well Klay will come back from his injury, but his shooting should also age well. Between the injury and age, however, he probably loses some defensive value. Dray has already shown signs of decline, but he does have a cerebral game, so I could see him having a Serge Ibaka type of second wind to his career.

Coach and Management: Steve Kerr is obviously a championship level coach, and management has been solid over the years.

Notes: Obviously, the details of the deal to get Giannis could change, which would obviously affect the situation. The theoretical fit between Giannis and the spacing of Steph and Klay is pretty insane, as is the defensive fit with Dray. The big question here is how age affects those core guys, along with some lesser questions about depth (which some ring chasing vets should help fix).

&#x200B;

If I have missed any options, I apologize, but I think those are the ones I have seen discussed as realistic possibilities.

Out of those options, I think I would rank the ring possibilities as follows:

1. Mavs
2. Raptors
3. Warriors
4. Bucks
5. Heat

My reasoning is this. I don't think any of those other situations can compare to the big three of Luka, Porzingis and Giannis. Assuming health, that team seems like the closest thing to guaranteed chips basically every year of a potential Giannis deal. As awesome as the Giannis/Luka inside/outside combo would be, the Giannis/Porzingis fit on the front line seems utterly seemless. They are both elite rim protectors, their length defensively would be utterly insane, and Giannis has always fit best with a big who shoots from outside, like Porzingis does. This big three has dynasty written all over it, if it ever came to pass.

For second and third place, I gave the Raptors an edge over the Warriors primarily because of age. If the Warriors were able to sign Giannis without giving up a huge package, it would be a different story, but as it stands, they would lose a lot of depth with that deal, and the Warrirors' big three are all over 30 already, so by the time you are getting to the end of a 3+1 Giannis deal, all those guys are in their mid 30's. You can look at each of them and make an argument for why their game will age well, but considering it is an issue for all of them, you have to assume that at least one will show serious age related decline pretty early in that contract.

As for the Raptors, that potential lineup looks like pretty much the perfect modern NBA lineup, top to bottom. Everyone can shoot threes, everyone is a high level defender, and both your ""bigs"" (Giannis and Siakam) can switch onto perimeter players with ease. They would have elite rim protection, elite wing defence, and excellent guard defence, too. Considering that most of that core is championship hardened, after last year, and several of the players have solid upside, I think they rank above the other options.

I debated between the Bucks and Warriors for third place, too. Ultimately, I found it hard to go against the proven championship mettle of the existing Warriors core, but there is a strong argument to be made for the Bucks, too. Their core has proven that it works together, while any other situation still requires players to learn to play together. There is some risk of decline on Lopez, in particular, but I think Bledsoe will remain solid for the length of a potential Giannis deal. Middleton should be solidly in his prime for the length of the deal, too, and is still improving. The Bucks already are a championship caliber team, make no mistake, so don't take this the wrong way, but I just feel like the cores above them are better suited to win chips, whether because of talent level or championship experience.

As for the Heat, honestly, after going through their roster, I was surprised to see them this low when I tallied things up. Their situation definitely looks like a championship roster, I just couldn't justify ranking them above any of the other groups. The biggest concern here is age related decline for Jimmy Buckets. He obviously hasn't shown any yet, but we are still a year and a half, or so, away from the earliest date that Giannis could suit up for them. Jimmy could avoid decline until 33 or 34, but that is only a year or two into a potential Giannis deal. Also, I'm not totally sold on the spacing of a Bam/Giannis frontcourt, especially if Jimmy's three point decline is an ongoing thing. Bam doesn't fit the archetype of a three point shooting big, which has proven to work the best with Giannis. The support guys are solid, and Duncan Robinson would hit so many threes, but I still don't think that's enough to put them above any of the other cores.

Anyways, those are my thoughts. What do you guys think? Do you agree or disagree with my rankings? Is there a squad I have missed? Should I have included the Knicks so we could all laugh at James Dolan again?

Also, are there any other free agents from the 2021 class who would fit onto one of these rosters and make a monster team?",nbadiscussion

Obviously, teams like both LA's wouldn't benefit that much, because the jump from LeBron and AD to 2 LeBrons is not that big (IMO), but granted that Lakers team would have been my pick for your 2020 NBA champions. Bucks would have been interesting with 2 Giannises, but what should be taken into account is also the ability to effectively play 2 of them at the same time in the same scheme without Middleton, and how compatible would they be since Giannis has a usage rate of 36.2% in this season.

1240,245,How do you guys expect Steph Curry and Klay Thompson to age? What kind of roles do you see them having on a team in their mid to late thirties?,"For some context, I've only been following the NBA for close to three years, so I don't have a great perspective on how certain guys age and historical precedents and all that.

What I do know is that a player's reliance on athleticism matters a lot, which should work in both Curry's and Klay's favor as neither rely heavily on athleticism to be effective. They'll obviously always be good shooters. Klay's defense will go sooner than anything as his lateral quickness deteriorates, but he should still have solid enough fundamentals to be a positive on that end for a while.

What kind of roles do you guys see them playing when they're 35 or 36? What about \~38? I'm particularly interested to hear from people who have watched the NBA long enough to have a good idea what non-athletic shooters look like as they get older. Of course, every situation is unique. Curry is clearly the best shooter ever (as well as a very skilled passer) and Klay is a top 5 all-time shooter who doesn't need to create shots to be effective. All of this will help them age well.

Curry and Klay are my favorite players, so I'm curious what I can expect to see from them over the next 5 or 10 years!",nbadiscussion
1241,246,Has OKC turned CP3 into a positive trade asset?,"Was watching the OKC-SAC game last night and saw The Point God take over in the fourth, as he has been regularly doing this season. He is taking clutch performance to a whole new level. I, for one, am loving this Revenge Tour CP3.

However, he's still owed 41m and 44m for the next two seasons, which is a whooping amount for someone turning 35 soon. And he's surrounded by a cast of players that don't really need him to dominate for the first 40 minutes or so, which is imo the perfect situation for him. And his health is always a big question now, esp when it comes to playoffs.

So, if you are a GM for a contender this offseason, do you give up assests to acquire CP3 and upgrade your point guard to Clutch Point God? If so, how much do you give up? If you're Sam Presti, do you keep him around and keep riding this gravy train? Or do you trade him off for even more assets?",nbadiscussion

Free throws represent a more controlled setting, allowing a closer examination of the potential physiological mechanisms behind success in repeated motions, while field goal attempts represent the setting most observers have in mind when commenting on a player's repeated shooting success. We examine these two settings together, within the same players in the same games, permitting a more comprehensive analysis of the hot hand. We find a small hot hand effect for free throws, concentrated in second and third shots in a free throw sequence, in players shooting at least 100 free throws in a season, and in games where players shoot four to five free throws. We find the opposite results for field goal attempts. If a player makes a field goal, he is less likely to make his next field goal attempt. These results are robust to controlling for the characteristics of the previous shot. Interestingly, both offenses and defenses respond to made field goals as if the hot hand effect exists.",nbadiscussion
1243,248,Does anyone else have a big problem with Dr Oz playing in the All Star Celeb Game?,"I'm not a big fan of All Star weekend. The dunk contest scoring is a joke the skills challenge could be so much better than what it is, the list goes on. For the most part I couldn't care less about the celebrity game. I have never watched one and doubt I ever will but seeing Dr Oz on one of the teams is a pretty disappointing move from the NBA when I'm sure they have no shortage of celebrities keen to play. If you have 16 minutes to spare John Oliver has a good piece on a variety of shitty things Dr Oz has done [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA0wKeokWUU) otherwise I have summarised the highlights below.

&nbsp;

Dr Oz had an entire episode of his show devoted to ""forms of therapy that are designed to turn a gay person straight"". Unsurprisingly Dr Oz never mentioned during the episode mainstream medical bodies state that conversion therapy can be harmful because it may exploit guilt and anxiety, thereby damaging self-esteem and leading to depression and even suicide.

&nbsp;

One of the products Oz was promoting, Green Coffee Bean Extract, was found to have no weight loss benefits. Two of the researchers who were paid to write the study admitted that they could not back their data so they retracted their paper. The FTC filed a complaint that the Texas-based company Applied Food Sciences (the promoters of the study) had falsely advertised. The FTC alleged that the study was ""so hopelessly flawed that no reliable conclusions could be drawn from it"" so Applied Food Sciences agreed to pay a $3.5 million settlement

&nbsp;

Dr. Oz is a spokesman and advisor for the website RealAge.com, which The New York Times has criticized for its pharmaceutical marketing practices. The site solicits medical information from visitors to determine a visitor's biological age and then uses the visitor's medical profile for pharmaceutical marketing purposes. 

&nbsp;

A study published in the British Medical Journal on the effectiveness of Oz's medical advice found that only 46 percent of his recommendations had any scientific backing or rationale. The study showed that 39 percent had no supporting scientific evidence, while the remaining 15 percentage points went directly against scientific evidence.

&nbsp;

In April 2015, a group of ten physicians from across the United States, including Henry Miller, a fellow in scientific philosophy and public policy at Stanford University's Hoover Institute, sent a letter to Columbia University calling Oz's faculty position unacceptable. They accused Oz of ""an egregious lack of integrity by promoting quack treatments and cures in the interest of personal financial gain""",nbadiscussion

1246,251,"What is the most common criticism of your favorite player, and do you agree with it?","My favorite player of all time is Tim Duncan and - correct me if I'm wrong - the most common criticism of Duncan's career is that, despite his five titles, he never went back-to-back. 

On the surface, I can see why this is a criticism of Duncan's career. Aside from Larry Bird, all of the common top 12ish players ever have back-to-back titles (MJ, Kareem, Bron, Magic, Russell, Hakeem, Kobe, Shaq). But with more context, I think the critique falls flat when looking at what prevented Duncan from repeating as champion. His injury at the end of the 2000 season prevent him from even attempting to repeat; Fisher's .4 second shot brutally shifted the momentum of the Spurs/Lakers series after everyone thought Duncan hit the game-winner with his running blind fade-away; Manu's dumb foul in the 2006 semis against Dallas prevent SA from coasting through a WCF against an injured Suns team (No Amar'e, Marion struggling, etc) and handling a confusingly-constructed Heat team; then there's 2012-2014 where they legitimately could have 3-peated if not for A) OKC tapping into a generational level of talent for four straight games (Including the last handful of games of the regular season, the Spurs were on a 20-game win streak following their WCF Game 2 win), B) The single greatest shot in NBA history by Ray Allen, and C) the argument that the loss in 2013 fueled the shellacking that occurred in 2014. 

The things that prevented Duncan from repeating were absurd. If you run his career 100 times, there's a serious case to believe there are over 50 versions where he ends up with more titles than he currently has. In closing, I think the argument is absurd.",nbadiscussion

1249,254,Hardest Rebuild in the NBA currently,"NBA is highly competitive today but there remain some teams who seem o be headed nowhere and with nothing to really look forward to for the fans. I was wondering which rebuild could be the hardest in years to come and if the team doesn't improve they could be forced to even change markets. 

In my opinion, the award of the hardest rebuild should go to Detroit Pistons. Many of you could be disagreeing with me but let me explain why?

Biggest problem with them is they have no real young talent. Detroit have a quality player in Blake Griffin who is at best a borderline all star today. Apart from that there is no one who you could pin the hopes of the franchise on. Blake Griffin doesn't have much trade value and is injury prone. His contract won't find many suitors as well. Apart from that D Rose is a good player after recovering from the various injuries throughout his career whose contract ends next year. Griffin Rose both don't have the capability to lead a team to the CHIP or even the playoffs. Apart from that they aren't the best team at drafting or all that good at attracting free agents. Christian wood is a decent player and he hits free agency this year and will be expensive to keep. 

While they have been one of the best teams in the Late 80's and early 90's and the early 2000's, I don't see them changing markets obviously. Something needs to change there and unless they can get a generational player or develop one through the draft there is nothing that signals a change in fortunes for the Pistons. 

Where are you all on this? Is Detroit the toughest rebuild in the NBA for you or is there some other team that takes the title of the Hardest Rebuild in the NBA in your eyes?",nbadiscussion

1251,256,"[OC] Explaining James Harden’s “put on the brakes”, rapid deceleration ability| Biomechanics & sports science breakdown"," [https://youtu.be/fAPXMhbm3cI](https://youtu.be/fAPXMhbm3cI)

Hey everyone - I explained James Harden’s incredible ability to put on the brakes and decelerate quickly, a key part of what makes him one of the toughest covers in NBA history, via the lens of biomechanics and sports science.

 Here’s a table of contents, header (sub-headings):

\- 0:00 Intro

\- 0:28 Balance and low center of gravity (balance, get low)

\- 1:00 Coordination and weight shifts (in sync, steps on the brakes)

\- 2:26 Neuromuscular control and eccentric strength (elite control & strength, other examples)

\- 4:15 Harnessing leverage (counterforce braking)

For those at work or the hard of hearing, I've transcribed subtitles on YouTube so sound isn't required.

Summary (will do my best without the visuals): One of James Harden's greatest strengths is his ability to decelerate (slow down) extremely quickly. There's multiple components that give him those incredible ""brakes"". Firstly, he always attacks from a balanced, wide base of support that provides a stable platform to start and end moves and maintains a low center of gravity/mass that improves balance even more and allows him to coordinate sequences and shift weight really quickly. His coordination between upper and lower body is superb and makes for extremely efficient movements and some of the nuances (like maintaining a forefoot position with his back foot) allow him to shift weight extremely quickly and decelerate. Further, Harden has incredible neuromuscular control which is the mind-body system that activates and sequences muscles in preparation for and during movement. When combined with his eccentric muscle control - muscles stretching and coming under tension - it gives him an elite ability to stop quickly. Lastly, he understands how to use leverage and contact to help counteract his forward momentum and pair with his already high level deceleration ability. All these things combine to make him a really difficult ""start-stop"" attacker.

This game was a decent one to watch with Boston making the plays we've normally seen Miami make at this point later in the game to extend that lead.  Miami was unable to make that comeback as they did in games 1 and 2.  
  
Since I have to fill in the 500 characters: This series has had a few interesting tidbits with Butler, who has been earning a Free Throw rate reminiscent of Shaquille O'neal and Wilt Chamberlain, has been kept more in check by the Celtics defense in that regard, at least when it comes to the free throw line.",nbadiscussion
1253,258,People who believe the NBA has rigged/biased everything to get Pels the 8th seed: What would you have done differently?,"Complaints surfaced when it was announced a 22 team league was looking likely. ""Just to get Zion in"" people said, but to invite 8 more teams simply to serve as virus fodder so that the SOS doesn't get altered would be an incredibly irresponsible and difficult thing to do, which would also make for a lot of boring and pointless games that would strain the makeshift logistical system even more.

The play-in tournament structure means that the 8th seed team gets a 75% chance of going through assuming they are evenly matched, and all Grizz have to do to avoid it altogether is gain 1 more game. Setting the threshold any lower than 4 games behind would have been unfair to the teams who were looking good and within striking distance with 1/4 of the season left. I could see an argument for 3 games behind, but it's splitting hairs.

It's not just the Pels with a shot to get in either. There are a lot of teams bunched up and if you invite one you need to invite the rest. I can see an argument for not inviting the Wizards, and maybe the Spurs and Suns. I imagine that not inviting them screws the scheduling though because not enough teams would be present, so they relaxed the parameters a tad. That is an assumption but it's a far less tenuous assumption than ""NBA is RIGGED!!11""

If somebody here can't articulate exactly why the NBA is biased, or any suggestions for what else could have been done, then I'll just have to assume the people crying foul are a bunch of Karens or Blazers fans.   


To Blazers fans, I say this: The hiatus allowed your roster to get healthy, and it's not anybody's fault Ariza isn't joining the squad. Yes, the removal of bottom feeder teams hurts you disproportionately, but tiebreaks being based on winning % helps you disproportionately against your main rival for the play-in tournament, the Pelicans.

Giannis also holds opponents to the lowest FG% near the rim. You could argue that Giannis has a better defensive supporting cast and that possibly inflates his advanced numbers but the Bucks' defensive rating without players such as Bledsoe, DiVencenzo, Lopez, and Matthews off the court and with Giannis on the court is still the best defensive rating in the league. 

One could also argue that Davis has been more versatile defensively this season but the chart below reveals that they've spent indentical percentages of their playing time guarding each of the 5 positions with the only noticeable difference being Davis spending nearly 9% more of his playing time guarding centers.

1255,260,Taking a look at every post-Jordan era Eastern Conference Champion - 1999-2003,"I've been reading about the weakness of the East after Jordan left and how it was a cakewalk for western teams in the Finals. The East team managed to win 8 out of the 10 past Finals, with only the Knicks and the Magic failing to do so, and now that MJ left, lost 5 Finals in a row as a heavy underdog. I wasn't old enough to watch or remember those games, so I decided to analyze the Eastern Conference champion for the every season since 1998-99 (MJ left) to 2002-03 (since the Pistons managed to upset one of the most talented teams ever assembled the season after that), to try to understand what they were about, how they played, what their road to the Finals was, how tough it was and ultimately why did they get outmatched in the Finals the way they did.

&#x200B;

**1998-99 Knicks**

Let's be fair to the Knicks, they overachieved massively and were the first 8th seed to make the Finals in NBA history, all credit to Jeff Van Gundy for that.  The amazing part in all of this is that their best player, former superstar center, Patrick Ewing was missing for the most of the ECF. They had an above .500 record in the lockout shortened season which was good enough for the 8th seed. This meant they were taking on the Mourning/Hardaway led Heat with a good supporting cast.

The Knicks didn't do anything amazing on offense, with their best scorer with 16 PPG being Latrell Sprewell who came off the bench, but were amazing on defense. The Heat, who finished the regular season with around 105 points scored on average, didn't score more than 87 points in any of their 5 games. Mourning still did his thing with 22/8 and 3 blocks on average, but his sidekick, Tim Hardaway, didn't show up at all. Tim dropped his season averages from 17/7 on 40/36/81 shooting down to 9/6 on 27/20/63 shooting. Dan Majerle didn't help out either averaging only 4 PPG on 19 FG% and that effort by the Knicks defense, as well as Houston being tremendously efficient on offense, meant the Knicks would upset the 8th seed in 5 games and move on to Atlanta in the 2nd Round.

Atlanta was an easier task for the Knicks. The Hawks were seen as a defensive team, having finished second in defensive rating in the league and having defensive studs like Dikembe Mutombo and Mookie Blaylock. This still didn't prevent the Knicks' 6th man Sprewell in torching them for 23 points a game. Houston chipped in with 18 PPG and the story remained the same in the Second Round. The Hawks didn't really have a good offensive player other than Steve Smith who the Knicks kept in check well, with him averaging 16 PPG on 27 FG%. With Smith neutralized and the Knicks offense rolling, New York managed to sweep the Hawks easily.

Moving on to the ECF and the historic Knicks-Pacers rivalry. The Pacers were deep and were looking to make a push for a spot in the Finals with Jordan out of the way. They had a lot of solid veterans such as Reggie, Mark Jackson, Rik Smits, the Davis boys, Chris Mullin and Sam Perkins, as well as their new talented prospect, Jalen Rose. They managed to split the first two games of the series, but the Knicks were facing a huge problem after Game 2. Their starting center, Ewing, was out for the remainder of the playoffs. Everyone counted them out at this point, the Pacers swept every team until now and were far more experienced. The Knicks had their little fairytale run, but it seemed to be over. Jeff Van Gundy adjusted and the Knicks played a faster paced offense than usual. The Knicks managed to grab game 3 to everyone's shock, with that iconic Larry Johnson buzer beater and won the series in 6. Defense wasn't the key part for them in this series, it was their offense. 4 Knicks players averaged over 14 PPG for the series and Marcus Camby played out of his mind. He averaged 14/11 with 3 blocks on 58 FG% and the Knicks shocked everyone as they made the Finals. Their great play throughout the series prompted the term ""The Ewing theory"" which was about teams' playing better with their star player out.

Without Ewing the Knicks were no match for the Spurs and their ""Twin Towers"". Duncan dominated, meanwhile Robinson had a good series himself as well. Sprewell and Houston each averaged 20+ PPG, but no one else on that New York team even averaged more than 10. Houston shot terrible from the three and the Knicks had absolutely no answer for Timmy. They managed to take a game, but that was all they could muster. Their massive underdog story came to an end and the first heavily predictable Finals was out of the way.

**1999-00 Pacers**

The 90s just wasn't the Indiana's decade, with them falling just short of making the Finals several times. They had a great record this year, a good group of veterans making a last attempt at a run for a title, with the emergence of the talented Jalen Rose, who provided Reggie Miller a partner on offense to share the load with, making their offense the best in the league. Things were all set, but the road to the ECF wasn't as easy as last year.

The Bucks gave Indiana a lot of problems in the First Round. The Allen/Cassell/Robinson Big 3 showed their worth and Tim Thomas also provided some much needed help for them off the bench. Reggie and Rose both had good series' and Dale Davis showed why he was an All-Star that year, providing a big body down low which the Bucks lacked and leading 4 out of 5 games in rebounding. The Pacers avoided a scare and a loss to the 8th seed for the second time in a row, by a 1 point win in Game 5.

The early 2000s Sixer teams are praised for their defense, same goes for this one. The Pacers still managed to carve them open and score over 100 points in 3 out of their 4 wins with Reggie Miller having a God series with 26 points on 52/47/96 shooting and Jalen Rose following his lead with 22 points on 43/44/86 averages. Iverson did his thing, although not very efficiently, but he had help too with McKie, Hill and Ratliff all averaging above their season averages in scoring. Reggie and the Pacers still handled their business well and got past Philadephia in 6 games.

Incoming Knicks-Pacers part 2. For the sequel to last years ECF we had an entertaining series. On one side Reggie and Jalen were doing their thing and on the other Houston and Larry Johnson were shooting lights out from three, averaging 58% and 57% respectively with Spree doing his thing as usual. Indiana got the better of New York this time around and the difference maker was in my opinion their center, Dale Davis. Dale averaged 9/14 on 54% shooting against an aging Ewing, Camby and Thomas. His 14 rebounds a game average was by far the most out of anyone this series, beating out second placed Ewing by double.

I have to give credit to this Pacers team, they managed to win 2 games in the Finals against the Lakers, keep another 3 relatively close and keep Kobe on 16 PPG, 37 FG% averages. This was just one of the best individual Finals performances I've ever seen by Shaq. The man averaged 38/17 with 3 blocks on 61 FG%. He was just absolutely unstoppable. Reggie and Jalen kept up their good play in the Finals and Austin Croshere did good as well, but that wasn't enough. I praised Dale Davis in this post a couple of times, but him and Rik Smits were just no match for Shaq, who was on a clear mission.

**2000-01 76ers**

Like I said previously, this 76ers team was praised for their defense, and rightfully so. Their whole offense revolved around Iverson, who was the league's MVP this year, and some help from McKie off the bench, meanwhile their defense was a team effort. Players like Lynch, Snow and Hill were starters just for that side of the ball. They also had two solid rim protectors that season. Theo Ratliff, who was averaging 12/8 and leading the lead in blocks with 3.7 that year, was named an All-Star and traded for another All-Star rim protector, Dikembe Mutombo, to the Hawks during the season. Mutombo became a key factor in that 76ers defense and went on to win the DPOY in that season. Iverson was not a liability on defense either, he led the league in steals with 2.5 a game. COTY, 6MOTY, DPOY, a top 5 defense in the league and the league MVP being their offense, they were set for the playoffs.

A rematch was scheduled against the Pacers in the First Round and the 76ers managed to get revenge. This analysis made me respect Reggie a lot more than I did before. The man averaged 31 points on 46/43/93 averages at age 35. The MVP played in MVP fashion with 32 PPG and got some help from 6MOTY McKie on offense and DPOY Mutombo on defense to get the job done in 4 games, despite Reggie's best efforts.

The Raptors were a team slightly similar to the 76ers in my opinion. They had a clear star in Vince Carter, his sidekick big man Antonio Davis and role players who knew what their roles were. It was a highly entertaining 7 game series, with the last game coming down to the last possession. AI and VC were going at it, and Davis had an excellent series as well. Game 7 though wasn't the AI vs VC battle we were used to throughout the series, it was surprisingly the McKie vs Davis battle. Allen and Vince both had bad shooting, 21 and 20 point games respectively, but their number 2 options came in big. McKie had 22 on 50% shooting, meanwhile AD had 23/9 on 73%. The series was decided by a Vince Carter miss off of a great pump fake and the 76ers were marching their way to the Conference Finals.

On come the Bucks, in the series that some call one of the worst officiated series of all time. The battle of the Big 3s this time around with the Bucks Big 3 of Allen/Cassell/Robinson and the 76ers Big 3 of Iverson/Mutombo/McKie all having great series'. In addition to them being on their level, Thomas and Ervin Johnson for the Bucks and Hill and Jumaine Jones for the Sixers were all important additions. The large controversy that surrounded the series was because of the refs favoring the Sixers with having them shoot 186 as opposed to Milwaukee's 120. Iverson and Mutombo shot 55 and 58 FTs respectively, meanwhile the highest amount of free throws a Bucks player shot was Cassell with 35. The 76ers won in 7, with Iverson putting up 44 points in the final game.

Moving on to the third Finals in a row in which the western team was a heavy favorite to win in. The Lakers managed to back up all the talk and eliminated Philly in a gentleman's sweep. The Sixers managed to shock everyone and win Game 1, but it was all smooth sailing since that. The Shaq/Mutombo matchup was more one sided than people thought,  McKie dropped his scoring numbers significantly and Iverson did his thing. Shaq played yet another dominant Finals, 33/16/5/3, and Kobe played his part as well with 25/8/6. The Sixers defense had no match for their dynamic duo, with great contributions coming from Fisher and Horry as well, especially shooting the deep ball.

**2001-02 Nets**

Jason Kidd managed to transform the Nets from a 26 to a 52 win team and an ECF champion in just one season. That's pretty amazing if you ask me. The Nets were a balanced team in every sense of the word. They basically had 3 number one options on offense with Kidd, Martin and Van Horn all averaging around 14 points a game and taking similar amount of shots a game. Kittles wasn't far behind also, with the 40% deep ball shooter averaging a solid 13 a game. Jefferson and Harris were nice sparks off the bench as well and having a top 5 defense was a major part of their success, as they were always looking to score from a fast break with Kidd leading the way.

First Round against a young Pacers team, trouble already. Reggie kept doing his thing at age 36 (this man's longevity was amazing) with good, efficient scoring and Jermaine O'Neal gave us a glimpse of what was to come in the future with 17/7 averages. Tinsley had a really off series, dropping his season averages of 9/8 to 4/5 and Artest and Brad Miller didn't hit their prime yet for them to be having more major impact. Kidd (22/6/8, 2 steals) and Kenyon (19/7) played amazing and the Nets managed to barely get past Indiana.

The Hornets got past the T-Mac Magic in the First Round, but the Second Round was a different story. They were a pretty average team, with the emphasis being on defense with players like Baron Davis, P.J. Brown, George Lynch, Elden Campbell and Jamal Magloire getting substantial minutes. It showed for a period, Davis averaged 4 steals this series and Campbell averaged 3 blocks. All the Nets players basically averaged their season averages that series, with J Kidd even upping his scoring from 14 to 18 points a game. That was all the Nets needed to comfortably take care of this Hornets team in 5.

""The Truth"" has arrived and Antoine with him. The duo of Pierce and Walker truly played great, with the averages of 24/9/4 and 23/10/4 respectively, but the Nets had more depth. Aside from Kenny Anderson and Rodney Rogers giving some help scoring wise, the other Celtic players just didn't contribute much on that side of the ball, meanwhile the Nets, like I said, were a really balanced team. They had 6 players (Kidd, Kittles, Martin, Van Horn, Harris and Williams) average double digit points, meanwhile Kidd managed to average a triple double, 18/11/10. The depth of this Nets team really showed and prevailed this series, managing to close them out in 6 hard fought games, with both Pierce and Walker having an awful Game 6.

Listen, the Nets were never going to win this series. The Lakers three-peated with a sweep, Shaq was the most dominant player in the league and showed it in yet another Finals averaging 36/12 with 3 blocks, Kobe played even more convincingly than last time dropping 27/6/5 on 51/55/80 shooting and Fisher, Fox and Horry were slinging it from three on great percentages (67, 46, 46).  The Nets didn't have a center that can match-up with Shaq and the combination of MacCulloch and Collins was never going to cut it. On the bright side, Kidd (21/7/10 with 2 steals) and Martin (22/7) had great series' and managed to keep the score respectable for 3 out of 4 games.

**2002-03 Nets**

Yet another Nets team on this list, this time with a slightly new look. They traded their starting center, Todd MacCulloch, and starting small forward, Keith Van Horn, in order to get the former multiple time DPOY winner, Dikembe Mutombo, to bolster their interior D. Mutombo went on to play only 24 games for this Nets team during the regular season and when he did, it was bellow expectations. Kidd and Martin each improved their scoring numbers, meanwhile Jefferson emerged into a starter who was dropping 16 a night.  Harris also improved his scoring and the team, despite having a below average offense, had the top rated defense in the league which helped them in securing the second seed in the East.

A difficult, well balanced Bucks team to start the playoffs off. The Bucks were the second best offense in the league that year, having some really solid offensive players like Gary Payton, Sam Cassell, Tim Thomas, Michael Redd and Toni Kukoc. They traded their star, Ray Allen, for Seattle's star veteran, Gary Payton, mid season. The three main guys for the Bucks that series were Payton, Thomas and Cassell with the averages of 19, 18 and 17 points respectively. They also got double-digit scoring averages from Kukoc and Desmond Mason, which led to 5 of their players averaging 10 or more points. The center positions was a slight problem for them, because even with Joel Przybilla and Ervin Johnson starting games there, and playing really bad, an undersized Anthony Mason got the most minutes at center. Still, Jason Collins wasn't a good scorer at that spot for the Nets, so he couldn't full advantage of it. The Nets also had 5 players in double-digit scoring wise, with Martin, 22, and Kidd, 18, leading the way. This battle of two very balanced teams went New Jersey's way in 6 games, as this was the first season where the First Round was played as the best of 7.

The Nets-Celtics rematch was set, this time in the Second Round as opposed to last year's ECF. ""The Truth"" arrived again in style, averaging 29/9/8 with 3 steals. Even though Pierce was playing amazing, Antoine failed to show up this time. Antoine was a huge piece for them this year, making his third All-Star Game, averaging 20/7/5 during the regular season, only to put up 14 a game during this series. Tony Delk had to step up as the second option for Boston and as for the rest of the help Pierce had, it wasn't all that. The Nets on the other hand played amazing basketball, with Martin and Kidd continuing to have great playoffs' and Jefferson stepping up big with 18/7/4 averages. It was a routine sweep for them, Pierce couldn't do it on his own.

This was the same Pistons team that won the Finals against the Lakers the next year, just without Rasheed Wallace, and the Nets handled them easily in 4 games. Chauncey had an awful series and all of the scoring load was on Rip Hamilton, whose only help on offense came from 36-year old Clifford Robinson. Ben Wallace played out of his mind on defense averaging 17 boards and 3.5 blocks a game, but that still wasn't enough for them to even win a game. Despite me bringing up how balanced the Nets were on offense, in this series they offense relied on Kidd and Martin heavily, and they came through. The first two games were close, while the last two were blowouts. The Pistons lacked the Billups they had during the regular season to try and pull off something.

This Finals series might be the closest and most balanced one of them all. The Spurs weren't a superteam yet, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili haven't reached their primes, meanwhile the ""Twin Towers"" weren't what they used to be either with Robinson aging. It was just Tim Duncan being one of the greatest players of all time and the Nets having no answer for him. Timmy averaged 24/17/5 with 5 blocks and completely justified why he's a back-to-back MVP. Parker, Robinson and Jackson helped a bit on offense, but it was mostly the Duncan show. Tim held Kenyon to 14 points a game on 34% shooting, despite Kenyon averaging 20 a game on the regular during these playoffs'. With no one to step up and follow Kidd's lead on offense and no solution for Duncan on defense, the Spurs managed to win the title in 6 games.

&#x200B;

The common theme I'm noticing is good coaching (Jeff Van Gundy, Larry Bird, Larry Brown and Byron Scott) and a good defense. Every single one of these teams, except for the Pacers, had a top 5 defense in the league. Also, all of these teams seemed to be really balanced. All of them were deep and had role players who knew their roles and were playing them well. They were all well organized, well coached teams, but when you come up against the generational talents like Shaq, Kobe and Duncan, there's really not that much you can do. Depth is most of the time beaten by sheer star power.",nbadiscussion
1256,261,How many rebounds will Steven Adams average now that Westbrook is gone? Could he lead the league in rebounding?,"Steven Adams is obviously one of the best offensive rebounders in the league, however it is no secret that he has sacrificed his own statistics as a defensive rebounder for Russell Westbrook to get the rebound instead.

In the last 3 seasons Russell Westbrook averaged 9 DRBs per 36 minutes at a DRB% of 28%. 

In that same span,  Steven Adams, a center and one of the best rebounders around, averaged only 4.8 DRBs per 36 at a DRB% of only 14.7%, which is lower than guys like Tobias Harris, Kyle Kuzma, Khris Middleton and even Chris Paul.

I think with Westbrook gone, Adams could be in position to become a dominant rebounder the likes of Drummond, Jordan and Howard and maybe even lead the league in rebounding if played enough minutes.

I don't see why they would defer rebounds now.",nbadiscussion

1259,264,"Should the NBA start courting India, given the situation with China, and India's large population / less willing to censor?","India is not just a billion-dollar market. It’s a billion-people market. Smart move, though it’d be tough to find an all-star level talent in any country that hasn’t really played the sport. 

China has over a billion population, is a much more developed nation, has more money and their fans are way more excited about NBA. That being said, out of all that we only had like 1 Chinese NBA player, Yao Ming. Would we see any superstar from India anytime soon? India has 1.x billion people, 2nd largest population in the world, and wins a only handful of medals at things like the Olympics. India just lacks a guy like Yao they can really promote.

India has proven they can churn out some of the best athletes in a sport, all they need is public interest. there is no sport that China is as good at as India is at cricket.

They have potential. There exists several barriers in front of them (infrastructure, professional staffing, resource allocation, but most notably, culture). Look at athletes in America. For the most part, they are black or white. You rarely see Asian athletes. Now look at professional schools in America. They are dominated by Asians (chinese, indian, or descendents of other neighboring countries). That's the reality of it. Asian culture prioritizes academics over sports. Even if the child has potential to be an elite athlete, they will not receive the encouragement , time , and resources necessary to succeed in a sports career in America, much less in China or India. That is the biggest reason

China was at a lower GDP per capita when Yao entered the league and made the NBA blow up in China. BUT China's GFP grew at an insane rate during that time. In 2002, China's GDP per capital was about 2.5 times the size India's. In 2017, China's GDP per capita was about 4.5 times times the size of India's.

Maybe the NBA is trying to tap into the India market, but it's not really comparable to the absolutely mind blowing growth in wealth that China has seen. People in China went from no electricity and living in rice fields to having smart phones in one generation.

China's authoritarian nature stops it from doing that, because they personally had pick kids that they think will be good athletes, creating an artificial barrier on the capacity to produce the athletes.

BUT Many things in India are just different. There are many even if they won't openly talk about it who to them look down upon this ""American way of following your passions and doing what you want"". In India tradition is much more king. IN other words for many upper class men it's become a doctor/engineer or businessmen and have your family arrange a marriage for you once you hit your late 20s. No matter how different people's backgrounds/skills/interests might be you'll be surprised just how many end up converging and following this type of path. Im obviously generalizing to an extent but the pt is there's not going to be nearly the same level of support in many cases of someone with legitimate basketball talent pursuing that passion in India as it would be in America. And without that support and infrastructure in place to help develop teenage talent it's just not going to really work often times.

With regards to women things have definitely improved the past 50 yrs but there's a good bit of sexism and general remnants of patriarchy throughout India. What I was talking about how there isn't really the most open culture in India towards kids just following whatever their passions are if they don't conform to norms........it's even worse for women. Also add in the fact that potential WNBA/women's basketball salary isn't near that of mens. Pursuing sports as a career is really only an option for the very liberal and very wealthy in India. India does seem to have changed pretty dramatically over the last 25 years, I don’t have a very good window into how much though.

1260,265,"[OC] The 3 greatest single-game scoring performances in NBA history, and why only one of them is in a league of its own","Throughout NBA history, the 3 most talked about & greatest scoring performances came from Wilt's 100, David Robinson's 71, and Kobe Byrant's 81.

Let's take a look about what occurred during these 3 separate games.

#Wilt Chamberlain's 100 point game

[Here is the full article](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1977443-is-wilt-chamberlains-100-point-game-overhyped), I'll just post a brief summary of what happened this game. I highly recommend reading this entire article as it is very interesting.

>Until the context is as widely known as the scoring total, Chamberlain's accomplishment will remain a mythologized achievement, one that gives the Hall of Fame center just a bit too much credit.

>""From accounts of how it went down, the Warriors spent almost the entire fourth quarter fouling to get the ball back and force-feeding Chamberlain the ball,"" writes CBS Sports' Royce Young. ""New York coach Eddie Donovan said, 'The game was a farce. They would foul us and we would foul them.' Chamberlain's shot attempts by quarter: 14, 12, 16, 21. You think in a blowout in today's game that a team would keeping feeding their star like that?""


>It's different for a player's teammates to foul the other team during a blowout, all with the intent of running up an individual's scoring total. That's when things become farcical, as Donovan mentioned in Young's quote.

>The fouls just piled up as the game got increasingly ridiculous. Both teams were intentionally getting refs to blow whistles, and the Knicks were doing everything possible to run the clock out before Wilt got to triple digits.

>Frank McGuire, the head coach of the Warriors, even put in his backups during the closing minutes of the fourth quarter, all with the intention of using them to foul New York and get the ball back into Wilt's hands.

#David Robinson's 71 point game

[Here is a great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvak2JkvQ_8&list=WL&index=4) detailing what occurred this game. Again, I'll give the summary


>It would be a year before the Spurs and Magic played again with Shaq & Robinson's personal beef continuing. But there was competing to be done from afar. 

>Entering the final day of the 93-94 NBA season, Shaq was on pace to win the NBA scoring title. He had 33 more points than Robinson on the season each with one game left to play that day. 

>Robinson knew this, his whole team knew this. So they got to work burying Shaq. They fed Robinson over and over and over again. The game was meaningless and it became a blowout quickly, but Robinson kept playing and kept scoring. By the end of afternoon he'd put up 71 points. One of the greatest performances in NBA history in a meaningless game. 

>That is supremely petty. Meanwhile Shaq scored 32 in his final game of the season, resulting in losing the 94 scoring title to Robinson in a wild finish.

---

#Kobe Byrant's 81 point game

[Here is the full game video of Kobe's 81 point game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcVPLnR-c3g)

This, unlike the previous two games, this was very competitive.

By the end of the 1st quarter, Lakers were down 7 points.

By the end of the 2nd quarter, Lakers were down 14 points. During the 2nd quarter, the Raptors had their largest lead of the game by 16 points.

By the end of the 3rd quarter, Kobe went berserk from a 25 point quarter and got the Lakers a 6 point lead.

At the 4th quarter, the game was mostly back and forth with the score difference being around 4-8 points. Usually between a 1 or 2 possession game. But alas, Kobe dropped 28 points in the 4th quarter to seal his 81 point game in a 16 point comeback win against the Raptors.


---
#Summary

All in all, Wilt's & Robinson's team fed them in an absurd way. Not only did they not take out the best player in a blowout, the winning team in the blowout kept fouling to get the ball back for the specific purpose of getting one guy as many points as possible.


Kobe had none of those shameful fouls to stop the game that Wilt had. And Robinson pulled his accomplishment in an absolute blowout where his team wanted him to get all the points to piss off Shaq and their beef. Wilt's game was also an absolute blowout. Robinson's game was the final game of the regular season where the standings would have been unaffected. 99.9% of the time, the star players rest here for the upcoming playoffs, yet Robinson still decided to suit up just for his Shaq beef.

Not to say these aren't impressive performances, it's just in my opinion that Kobe's 81 is the greatest single-game scoring performance in NBA history considering his team was down most of the game and he had to pull an offensive masterpiece to get the comeback win from 16 points down.


Kobe's was all organic, while their were some very sketchy things happening in Wilt's and Robinson's games.

Cousins has now suffered a torn achilles, a torn quad, and now a torn ACL within the last two years. This offseason, he signed a one-year deal with the Lakers for $3.5 million.

1. With Cousins likely out for the entire year, what are his long term career prospects? He didn't garner that much demand on the market before this, so it seems unlikely that many teams will want to sign Cousins after this injury.

1264,269,Do you think New Orleans' starting 5 is legit?,"Derrick Favors, Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram, Jrue Holiday, Lonzo Ball.

That starting 5 was [the best 5-man lineup with at least 200 minutes played together](http://bkref.com/tiny/KAXMS) this season at +25.9 points per 100 possessions, with 229.8 minutes played together.  Obviously, it's a small sample size, but the starting 4 of the lineup including possessions without Zion was +15.2 in 449.9, [which only 4 Milwaukee lineups beat with as many minutes played](http://bkref.com/tiny/0AV6o).

Without Zion, I had to do a bit of math to calculate what that meant Favors, Ingram, Holiday, and Ball played at in the 220.1 minutes without Zion, [and it's still a pretty solid +4.1 with Zion not on the court](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11vhm9eCtVDUYEU-IzFvEejbVYN8eVWKkiunTQIoADR8/edit?usp=sharing).

Just curious on your guys thoughts.  Obviously the team hinges on Zion, but those other 4 are good enough to be above average without him, but also being solidly below .500 means the rest of the team isn't there.

1265,270,Who loses in a Ben Simmons for Kemba Walker trade?,"Salary-wise the trade would work this offseason, once Ben's new contract kicks in. 

I feel like both teams get better, in terms of what each team gets:

***

**BOSTON**

 **Offence:**

* We already have three 3-level scoring wings atm competing for shots. A pass-first PG fits that lineup better than a score-first one.   

* We also have scorers (especially Tatum) who want to hold the ball down the stretch as well as one of the better late-game coaches in the league. Simmons' late-game passiveness isn't really an issue for Boston.

* A lot of people talk about surrounding Ben with shooters (which we can), but we also have ball-handlers to take the pressure off him in the half-court, our offence is capable of being a lot more fluid than Philly's is. 

* Because we don't have a logjam of PF/Cs we can actually get by using him as a front-court playmaker in addition to his PG responsibilities. He doesn't have to only be *'big Rondo'* in the halfcourt we could also use him the same way teams use a Jokic / Gasol / Horford / Bogut / Draymond. Have him establish a position and hit the cutting guard/wing. 



**Defence:**

 

* We're running a perimeter-centric, switch-heavy defence and we're looking to pressure the ball and force (and score off) a lot of turnovers. Simmons fits that defensive system perfectly. 

 Adding Simmons to:
  1. Brown's on-ball pressure
 2. Tatum's ability to disrupt passing lanes
 3. Smart's general ability to cause mayhem and force mistakes everywhere he goes
 
 Would be devastating defensively. Boston would comfortably lead the league in forced turnovers and perimeter defence (I would argue even over a team like LAC).



**Timeline:**

* *Simmons / Brown / Tatum* is one hell of a young trio going forward and all three would be locked down for the next 4 years minimum. That's before we count guys like Smart (who's only 25) and the young guys we're in the process of developing (Romeo, Grant, Rob, Tremont, Carson) and all the picks we have incoming (Next draft: Memphis', Boston's Milwaukee's 1st round picks). 

 
 

**Other:**

 * We're already experimenting with small-ball lineups because our coach is an absolute fiend for playing small and because it's the only way we can reasonably get our best 5 on the court. 

  *Smart / Brown / Hayward / Tatum / Simmons* would work incredibly well on both ends of the court. 

  It's not something you could use against a team with a dominant post-scorer like Philly, but we'd throw this lineup at Milwaukee / Indiana / Brooklyn / Miami every day of the week.


**Conclusion:**  Simmons fits Boston's *rebuild/develop while competing* mindset. It's not like the Celtics are going to be forced into a tank, they're still going to be one of the most competitive teams in the league, this trade would just help them keep that contention window open for longer and maybe increase the chances of a title down the line as all their young stars align in their primes.

 
***

**Philadelphia**   

**Offence:**

* Kemba has in his arsenal every serious on-ball scoring skill that Philly is lacking right now. In terms of scoring, Simmons can get to the basket. Kemba can do that **and**: 
 1. He can pull-up and shoot from anywhere
 2. He can run the PnR / PnP
 3. He can score in ISO
 4. He can get to the line and reliably shoot FTs
 5. He's incredibly capable of being that clutch scorer that they're sorely missing since Butler left
      
* Kemba's a serious off-ball threat, not only can he play the role of a star PG but he can seamlessly switch into the role of a suped-up JJ Redick whenever he wants. He's not only going to score on his own, but he's also going to create space for the other 76ers


**Defence:**

* Despite his stature, it's not like Kemba is some insurmountable drain on a team's defences (Boston are also top 5 while starting Kemba).

 Defence will be the big ESPN talking point if the trade were to happen, but Kemba is surprisingly active on that end. He puts the effort in, he communicates well, he's one of the best in the league at drawing charges.

 Philly would feel the loss of Simmons on the defensive end, but with a dominant defensive force like Embiid (and the development of their young wings like Matisse), Philly are still going to be a top 5-ish defensive team.

**Timeline:**

 * I would argue Kemba fits Philly's timeline better than Simmons does. Good young talent is never a bad thing, but Philly spent a lot of money on mature-age talent and should now try to strike while the iron is hot, a short term improvement makes sense:
  1. Horford isn't getting any younger
  2. Embiid/Harris/JRich are all in or around their primes
  3. Embiid's not going to be playing well into his 30s. He's big. He's heavy. He's injury-prone. At 25, Philly realistically needs to be working on a 5-year timeline.
        
    Winning now is Philly's best chance with Embiid. Trying to wait 3-4 years for Simmon's shooting to develop will put them in a real bind.


**Other:**

* Simmons is fast and dynamic and he wants to run the floor. Embiid is big and bulky and while he can be explosive he doesn't want to run a marathon every game. 

     Rather than having two stars trying to push the franchise in opposite directions, Kemba can slot perfectly into Embiid's slow/deliberate probing style of offence. 


* Kemba's not just a max player in his own right, he would open up possibilities for the other guys Philly have dedicated big contracts too.  

    *eg. Horford is one of the best players in the league at getting the most out of PGs, you'd be giving him a PG he can flex his skills with.* 





**Conclusion:** Philly loses one of the better young assets in the league for a 29-year-old with the hopes of turning their top-5 defence and middling offence into roster built around serious contention and elite level play on both sides of the court. 

 Their contention window loses width but gains depth.

***

For me, the biggest issue is sentimentality. 

* Kemba's been an absolute god-send in terms of how wonderful of a person he is. Boston really needed that after last year and it's hard to find any real complaints with what he actually brings to the table basketball-wise. Kemba hasn't given Boston any reason to trade him away. 

* Simmons is supposed to be 1/2 of the hopes and dreams of Philadelphia, it's a big ask for them to move on from him and it's always hard to trade young talent. There's also the option to go in another direction and maybe trade other players.

1266,271,[OC] Detailing Achilles injuries: the anatomy and physiology behind them,"I'm currently training as a foot and ankle surgical resident and have treated Achilles injuries both conservatively and surgically, don't want to give too much away here lol 

**What is the Achilles tendon?**

You have three main muscles in the calf, the medial and lateral gastrocnemius on the surface and the soleus under them, referred to as the triceps surae [image](https://rontherapist.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/14073272_237095860019204_936413939_n.jpg). The Achilles tendon is where those three muscles combine to attach to the heel bone aka the calcaneus [image](https://www.sportsinjuryclinic.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Insertional-Achilles-Tendonitis-Diagram2.jpg). 

**What does the Achilles tendon do?**

When the triceps surae contract, they shorten and pull the heel upwards, called plantarflexion. Plantarflexion is important for walking, jumping, running, etc. and is where the power to push off comes from. The opposite of plantarflexion is dorsiflexion, where the heel comes down and the toes go up in the air. Dorsiflexion is what stretches the triceps surae and the Achilles tendon. 

**How does the Achilles rupture, classically?**

The Achilles tendon is incredibly strong and resilient. It normally ruptures under high load. In most cases this is when someone is trying to push-off/plantarflex as the ankle is strongly dorsiflexing. For example, f someone is planting their foot and the heel is coming to the ground, but at the same time they are trying to push off (jump, change directions, etc.). The heel is moving down towards the ground with high velocity, but the calf muscles are trying to pull it back up to come off the ground. This push and pull on the tendon will cause immense load and can lead to partial tears or a rupture.

Think about a rubber band. If someone is pulling it one direction and you suddenly try to pull against them with all of your strength it’s likely going to snap. 

Classic literature says that the Achilles tends to tear in the “watershed” area. This is a few cm above where it attaches to the heel bone. Watershed means an area with decreased blood flow and thickness, which predisposes the area to tears.

**Why are people saying that the trainers/doctors probably knew it right away in the locker room?**

You can do a Thompson test. Have the patient lay on their stomach and hang their feet off the table. Squeeze the calf to simulate a contraction. If the Achilles is ruptured, it can’t pull the heel and plantarflex the foot. [image](https://litfl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Thompson-Test-1962.jpg)

Other tests include just asking the patient to plantarflex on their own. Different variations of tests like the Thompson test. A palpable defect in the tendon or noticeable swelling and loss of visualization of the tendon [image](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/tarupture-140227012909-phpapp02/95/tendoachilles-rupture-and-its-management-13-638.jpg?cb=1393464613).

**Can a strain (tear) of the calf muscles lead to this injury?**

Likely not. If someone had a tear in the muscle belly of the calf, they’d have pain and likely not be able to put that high stress load on the tendon. It’s likely that KD’s “lower calf strain” was actually some sort of minor Achilles tendinopathy (injury) to begin.

**Why I don't think it's a full rupture**

https://imgur.com/a/GBXZuGu

I did notice the KD was able to kind of plantarflex his foot when he was on the ground and even walking off the court which might be indicative of a less severe injury, maybe a partial tear. That being said, that's only something you could know on exam and imaging so we'll have to wait and see.",nbadiscussion
1267,272,[OC] Don't sleep on the Raptors' chances of repeating.,"If [NBA championship odds](https://www.sportsbettingdime.com/nba/championship-odds/) are an accurate indicator of favouritism, the Raptors are the 6th favourite to win the title. Whilst I understand that they don’t have Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard this season, that’s incredibly disrespectful for the defending champions. Outside the “big three” (Milwaukee Bucks, LA Lakers, LA Clippers), I believe that the Raptors have the best chance of winning the title this season.

Losing Leonard is no doubt a big blow to their championship aspirations. I personally think Pascal Siakam is a solid low-end #1 option, but you’d be forgiven for not having the same faith in him. Even in a best-case scenario, he likely doesn’t measure up to some of the other number one options on contenders.

However, what Toronto arguably lacks in top-end firepower, they more than makeup for with elite depth. VanVleet and Lowry are arguably a top-3 playoff back-court, Norman Powell is a contender for Most Improved, and was averaging over 23ppg for the six games prior to the shutdown. Ibaka and Gasol are an elite defensive front-court, and both can space the floor with reasonable effectiveness. Terence Davis is an incredibly underrated rookie and has shown a combination of elite outside shooting and elite athleticism. This isn’t even accounting for incredibly valuable role-players like OG Anunoby and Rondae-Hollis Jefferson.

The Raptors are not only surprisingly stacked, but they’re deeper than last season’s championship team. In fact, I’d argue that they’re the deepest team in the NBA. It’s true that rotations shorten in the postseason, but having this level of depth makes you a lot less susceptible to injury than any of the other contenders.

You cannot discount the intangible value of recent championship experience. Of their core rotation players, only Terence Davis wasn’t a member of the team last season. Not only have they “been there and done that”, but last season would still be fresh in their minds. The pressure of postseason basketball is less likely to phase them compared to most of their competitors.

Conventional and advanced statistics are also kind to the Raptors.

The adage “Defense wins championships” bodes well for Toronto. They boast the #2 defense in the NBA, behind the Milwaukee Bucks, and rank in the 94th percentile for both perimeter defense and interior defense.

As they proved last season, the Raptors have both the length and the depth to frustrate the Giannis’ and Embiid’s of the world on the offensive end of the ball.

The Raptors have two other key ingredients that are conducive to championship-winning basketball: 

* Elite off-ball movement.
* Elite shooting.

According to BBall Index, VanVleet (92.8 percentile), Davis (91.8 percentile) and Powell (91.4 percentile) are rotation players who are elite perimeter shooters. The aforementioned VanVleet (95.7 percentile) and Powell (94.5 percentile), as well as Pascal Siakam (90.2 percentile), are rotation players who are elite off-ball movers.

It’s almost unheard of to have three players graded in the top 10 percentile for both statistical measures, which bodes very well for the Raptors. Although they don’t have the same top-end star power, their statistical profile is eerily similar to the Durant-era Golden State Warriors teams, elite company to be keeping.

The Raptors resume their regular-season campaign July 31 against the LA Lakers and are currently 3.5 point underdogs. I wouldn’t be surprised if they win that game, en route to securing the #2 seed in the Eastern Conference.

I think that Toronto will meet the Bucks in the Eastern Conference finals, and once they’re there, they won’t be scared, as they vanquished them the prior postseason. Don’t sleep on the defending champs.

1268,273,Challenge: Create an NBA Championship-Caliber Team with no All-NBA Players,"**Guidelines (PLEASE READ THESE CAREFULLY):**

-Form a team you think would win a championship in the modern NBA with a starting 5 and 3 backup players.

-You can have a maximum of **two all-star players** on your team. Remember, they must have never made an All-NBA team

-Don't try to cheat the game by choosing a single season that a player wasn't an All-NBA player, but the rest of their career they were. The same idea applies to choosing a single season a player wasn't an all star to try to exceed the 2 all star limit

-Provide reasoning for your player selections


**Example Team:**

PG - Derek Harper (0x all star, 0x All-NBA)

SG - Shane Battier (0x all star, 0x All-NBA)

SF - Andrei Kirilenko (1x all star, 0x All-NBA)

PF - Rasheed Wallace (4x all star, 0x All-NBA)

C - Arvydas Sabonis (0x all star, 0x All-NBA)

Backup G - CJ McCollum (0x all star, 0x All-NBA)

Backup  F - Pascal Siakam (0x all star, 0x All-NBA)

Backup C - Lamar Odom (0x all star, 0x All-NBA)


My rationale behind this team: My whole starting lineup is filled with pretty stout and switchable defenders, especially my 1-4. There's plenty of shooting on the team. Derek Harper is the perfect role playing point guard: an all-defensive player, can knock down the 3 reliably, and can distribute the ball effectively. Shane Battier is the perfect 3 and D 2-guard. Kirilenko is my quarterback on defense and my do-it-all on offense. Rasheed Wallace can serve as my center when playing against more mobile teams, while bringing an edge and competitive fire to my team. Sabonis is important to my starting lineup to provide some low and high post playmaking. What the starting lineup lacks a little bit, however, is ballhandlers. So on my bench are 3 players who are perfectly comfortable with creating with the ball in their hands. My team can play small ball or bully ball depending on our matchup.



**To help out, here are some players you might want to choose from**

*Players who have made an all-star team, but have never made an All-NBA team:*

Backcourt Players - Mo Cheeks (4x all, 0x All-NBA), Jrue Holiday (1x all star, 0x All-NBA), Ben Simmons (1x all star, 0x All-NBA), Jeff Hornacek (1x all star, 0x All-NBA), Sleepy Floyd (1x all star, 0x All-NBA), Bradley Beal (2x all star, 0x All-NBA), Rip Hamilton (3x all star, 0x All-NBA)

Frontcourt Players - Andre Iguodala (1x all star, 0x All-NBA), Andrei Kirilenko (1x all star, 0x All-NBA), Sean Elliott (2x all star, 0x All-NBA), Dan Majerle (3x all star, 0x All-NBA), Rasheed Wallace (4x all star, 0x All-NBA), Mark Eaton (1x all star, 0x All-NBA), Kristaps Porzingis (1x all star, 0x All-NBA), Shareef Abdur-Rahim (1x all star, 0x All-NBA), Paul Millsap (4x all star, 0x All-NBA)



*Players who have neither made an all-star team nor an All-NBA team:*

Backcourt Players - Mike Conley, Patrick Beverly, Derek Harper, CJ McCollum, Mike Bibby, J.J. Redick, Ron Harper, Jalen Rose, Jason Terry, Jamal Crawford, Lou Williams, Eric Gordon, Tony Allen, Raja Bell, Shane Battier, Michael Cooper, Jalen Brown

Frontcourt Players - Bruce Bowen, Robert Covington, P.J. Tucker, Jayson Tatum, Tony Kukoc, Robert Horry, Arvydas Sabonis, Clint Capela, Serge Ibaka

1269,274,[OC] Saving Cam Reddish: The Mysterious Adventure of Cam Reddish Finding His NBA Play-style,"It was a pretty simple out of bounds call. Down one-point and under the basket, the play call appeared to get a simple shot either under the basket or feed it to RJ Barrett who was streaking into the corner. Leonard Hamilton’s team collapsed towards the center to match Duke’s movement. But as if the team was playing with only four defenders, Cam Reddish casually drifted out behind on the arc at the top of the zone.  Without a defender in sight, Reddish drills the three-pointer, capping his best performance on a college basketball stage, reminding the world for only a minute that Zion Williamson wasn’t the top recruit in the country and finally introducing himself to the world. 

January 12, 2019 was the shining moment for Reddish. It was meant to be his start at re-writing the narrative of his time in college. His incredible performance, helping lead the offense to a come-from-behind road game victory should have been in the headlines. It wasn't. The next game, they lost to Syracuse. Zion scored 35, Reddish didn’t play and it was back to square one.

When Cam Reddish announced his decision in a Players Tribune video, he gave off a signature line: I’m not a prospect, I’m a work in progress. There’s always more to learn.” The man looking to branch away from his quiet nature, quiet town life looked to do it on the biggest stage, Duke University, leading the charge with fellow top prospect RJ Barrett. College is meant to a branching out point for most—the moment of your life where you can truly be your own individual. The problem is that it can also bring up some of your worst habits. Zion Williamson committing to Duke was the worst thing to ever happen to Cam. What was meant to be Cam’s moment, wasn’t allowed to be Cam’s moment. Like an older sibling taking your thunder, Cam remained quiet. 

As he declared for the draft, he was the people said shouldn’t. Despite no one caring for the individual during his time, despite no one realizing how misused the athlete was, he was told to stay. The business decision paid off as he went 10th overall to the rising Atlanta Hawks and prepared the make the case for who he truly was an athlete. 

Since his entrance into the association, we’ve only been left with questions. Is he a NBA caliber player? Was he just flat out bad? Can he do anything? Who is this guy taking up minutes on the floor? 

Stuck between a rock and a hard place, its time to ask the simple question: can we save Cam Reddish?

Back in high school, Cam Reddish was recruited for his ability to be a modern basketball player. A flexible style, slim yet tall, incredible court vision was a scout’s wet dream. And we saw glimpses of that individual during college—moments where he had a ball in his hands, he was a completely different player. [It was as if he became a completely different basketball player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuZ2k-SF2E). But off ball, it wasn’t his forte. Being able to get to the basket, showcase his tight quarters skills and ability to finish, that’s what made him so special. His form was just an added bonus.

Reddish has fallen victim to a bug that most gifted shooters face—the natural form. Most of the times, shooters will begin their stroke from the shooter’s pocket and will subconsciously always look to start from the shooter’s pocket. Some players are taught to cheat this by either taking a dribble or attack the ball—rather than sit for their shot—for quicker transition into their shot. It was always a really good tell that a shooter had confidence in his shot—how quick he was to realize what he needed to do, the prior steps they took to be able to get the ball off as quick as possible. 

Cam doesn’t have these tendencies just yet, the ‘shooter IQ’ isn’t there at the moment. It does feel at times that he forces bad form or doesn’t work through the correct steps. Think about a cutting a vegetable. You could have incredible knife cuts but if the vegetable looks like shit, the pieces might still look like shit. 

But what if Cam is trying to be something that he is not? What if the stats could prove he’s effective as what was expected of him as a prospect in high school, that he truly isn’t mean to be a spot-up shooter despite all of this effort to make him one.

Stats are also a really good tell—the numbers don’t lie. Ignoring his comparison to other players in the association, here are some interesting tidbits in the profile of Cam Reddish:


**Dribbles (Frequency of shooting off of X Dribbles) - FG%**

* 0 (37.9%) - 24.1

* 1 (11.8%) - 55.6

* 2 (18.3%) - 25.0

* 3-6 (23.5%) - 22.2

* 7+ (8.5%) - 38.5%


**Touch Time (Frequency of shooting with this factor) - FG%**

* < 2 Seconds (47.7%) - 27.4

* 2 -6 Seconds (41.2%) - 27.0

* Touch 6+ Seconds (11.1%) - 41.2 


**General Range (Frequency of shooting with this factor) - FG%**

* Catch and Shoot (33.3%) - 17.6

* Pull ups (29.4%) - 26.7

* Less than 10 ft (37.3%) - 40.4

There’s a lot to look at but the numbers continue to describe the narrative: he’s meant meant to control his own shot. He has statistically performed better in possessions where he has been able to have the time to process what is going on. [We always joked about the double spin move but never comment on how he managed to get through three defenders for a good look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHUOtxQNrM0). Or how we won’t see the [highlight play of Cam Reddish dunking on Tyler Hero but we’ll get the highlight of a missed three pointer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO335mJ6alA).

 
You know how we hate it when a power big man takes a three pointer instead of backing down a weaker defender down low? Why won’t we hate it when a natural isolation scorer doesn’t take advantage of a weaker defender and get to the basket?

Reddish can be brilliant off of the dribble. His ability to see the court, his ability to create offense not only for himself but for his teammates. People will be quick to jump on his turnover to assist ratio or the amount of turnovers he commits but often times, most aren’t his fault. Whether it is the cheeky pass, the occasional tight quarters leading to the ball getting poked out or chemistry issues that come with joining a new line-up, he hasn’t been the ball handling liability he’s been made out to be. He also hasn’t been allowed to get into a rhythm—often times Atlanta will need to get several guards 20+ minutes a night.

Truly, Cam Reddish sought a fresh start in the big leagues but instead, it feels like he’s back at Duke. He’s not been used correctly—and while credit to Atlanta for being inventive with his usage, they still haven’t figured out the correct line-up as a whole. The team isn’t performing well as a whole and it is easy to push blame onto the developing Cam Reddish and avoid calling out the team being a complete cluster—filled with talent but no true definition. 

To save Cam Reddish, you need to save the team. The lack of chemistry, being creative to simply be creative, the pressure to succeed and the loss of John Collins have put the franchise in a tailspin, searching for excuses. What is to excuse Trae Young still has another he needs to reach, Bruno Fernando continues to be pushed down in favor for his Maryland brethren Alex Len despite showing a lot of promise as a NBA center. Atlanta’s depth in the guard position has made this reality a little more difficult to implement. So a player that is playing out of his natural position, not getting reps in a role that he could succeed in won’t help the young man’s confidence. It also doesn’t help that he is battling with lottery pick colleague De’Andre Hunter for minutes in the same position—who also has struggled but doesn’t get talked about enough.  

As he said out of high school, he’s a work in progress that hasn’t been allowed to develop. He’s a factory new car that is being stress tested to the point where he’s expected to break. Flexibility shouldn’t be abused but should be treated with care. Just because you have clay that is able to be molded doesn’t mean you just leave it alone, you try to provide definition. Time will heal the damage to Reddish’s game but may not heal the stigma associated with him. Despite the ability to be something special, it feels as if all factors are working against his favor and his quiet personality gets the best of him. Someday, we may just hope that he gets to the environment where he is allowed to speak and hate our lives when he goes on a podcast with his agent. But for now, we simply have to wait and see.",nbadiscussion
1270,275,"Finding the most efficient scorer, relative to their era.","I was wanting to find who was the most efficient scorer in NBA history, relative to the era in which they played. Then I found out about TS+. It's essentially how much better a player's TS% was compared to the average TS% from when they played. So if league average TS% was 50%, and a player's was 100%, their TS+ would be 200. 

This took a little bit of time to find for each player, so I only looked at guys that averaged at least 20 PPG for their career. This is a somewhat arbitrary benchmark, but it guarantees that all of these guys weren't simply getting easy dunks to the basket from pick and roll situations. All these dudes were legit scorers. 

With that said, here are the top 15 most efficient scorers in NBA history:

|Rank|Player|PPG|TS+|
--:|:--|--:|--:|
|1|Adrian Dantley|24.3|15.5|
|2|Stephen Curry|23.5|14.5|
|3|Charles Barkley|22.1|14.4|
|4|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|24.6|13.8|
|5|George Mikan|23.1|13.4|
|6|Kevin Durant|27.0|12.9|
|7|Wilt Chamberlain|30.1|12.8|
|8|Walt Bellamy|20.1|12.6|
|9|Jerry West|27.0|12.0|
|10|James Harden|25.1|11.5|
|11|Paul Arizin|22.8|11.0|
|12|Shaquille O'Neal|23.7|10.8|
|13|David Robinson|21.1|9.8|
|14|Bob Pettit|26.4|9.2|
|15|Bob Lanier|20.1|9.0|

Most those guys probably won't surprise you, but Dantley being number 1 kinda came as a shock to me. Dude was a bona fide scoring machine though for Utah. It's also not as though he wasn't a high volume scorer either, he won two scoring titles and from '80-'86 he averaged 30 PPG. He never had much success in the playoff until joining the Pistons late in his career, but if you asked people to name some of the great scorers from the '80s, Dantley's name doesn't come up very often and it absolutely should. 

Also because I know you're just as curious as I was, here are the 5 worst:

|Rank|Player|PPG|TS+|
--:|:--|--:|--:|
|1|Elvin Hayes|21.0|-4.1|
|2|Russell Westbrook|23.2|-2.8|
|3|Chris Webber|20.7|-2.7|
|4|Allen Iverson|26.7|-1.9|
|5|Pete Maravich|24.2|-1.4|

Westbrook and Iverson being on here was expected. Kind of interesting to see that Pistol Pete was similarly inefficient for his time though too, although his number would have certainly been better if he had played most of his career with the 3 point line. For Elvin Hayes, I have no idea how he was so bad. He won a scoring title in his rookie year, and was an average free throw shooter for a big man.",nbadiscussion
1271,276,Why I think Shaq is one of the greatest people to play Basketball,"Shaquille O'Neal, aside from being an incredible basketball player and one of the greatest to ever do it, also holds a BA (which he got as a promise to his mother), an MBA, and then a PhD (Doctorate in Education). 

  
In one interview, he describes his philosophy on how he would like to be great off the court and needs to be educated in order to do so. At his graduation ceremony (or some scholarly ceremony which I don't remember exactly), he discusses how he doesn't believe in 'Honorary' degrees and appointments because although he received an Honorary appointment at the LA police department he still opted to go through the training that everyone else did to become a deputy, and that he doesn't want an honorary degree and wanted to study and go through the same rigour that any other PhD holder did.

  
Shaq owns many businesses (restaurants, car washes, gyms, etc).

  
He also has done many great things such as covering the funeral costs of his basketball idol growing up, covering the funeral expenses for a shooting victim in Orlando plus extra, and you don't see all this pop up as much on social media.

1272,277,The sixers are .1 points off from ranking dead last in the league for the 2nd time in 3 years in 4th quarter offensive rating. How do the Sixers address their 4th quarter woes?,"Currently, they rank ahead of only Charlotte in terms of 4th quarter offensive efficiency. It's a bit surprising that they are this putrid despite the fact that their lack of shot creation and spacing is a pretty common talking point. Last year, when they had Jimmy Butler who was the clear closer they were 8th during the regular season(albeit 12th out of 16 in the playoff).

They have huge expectations coming into the year being along with Milwaukee the most common picks to make the finals out of the east, but thus far Milwaukee looks to be in a class of their own despite them losing Brogdon and not obtaining major FA acquisitions to replace him like Horford and Richardson did for Butler and JJ. 

Is there some schematic fix to this that falls on the hands of Brett Brown? Is this an issue of personnel that will need to be addressed via trade if they want a legitimate championship shot? Personally, like many I have issues with Brett Brown's coaching at times; but, I don't think they have the right distribution of play makers to match their on-paper talent.",nbadiscussion

To loosely quote Zach Lowe, I really enjoy watching Grizzlies unleash JV every 2 or 3 games to [mash teams with below-average rim protection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6FCgIP8P1E). Jonas can shoot above-the-break 3s occasionally on low volume (68 3PA, 38.2 3P%). He is quite solid in his defensive role in the Grizzlies' drop coverage and can move his feet decently for a big, but is vulnerable against strong pick-and-pop and pick-and-roll teams (e.g. Blazers, Wolves, Mavs).

1275,280,"The Biggest Myth In NBA History; Michael Jordan Played Against A Stronger Era and would average ""50"" Today","Full Article: https://www.opencourt-basketball.com/biggest-myth-nba-history-michael-jordan-played-better-competition-better-era/
--------
JORDAN PLAYED IN AN EXPANSION ERA.

Firstly, Jordan played (and mostly won) championships during an expansion era of the league. Yes, believe it or not, Michael Jordan played during an era where the league was still trying to find its own identity and incorporate different cities of America into the league. Because of this, Jordan played against some of the worst competition the league has ever seen, owning some of the worst records in NBA history that still stand today. During his career, 6 sub .500 teams were added to the league, which in turn, diluted an already inferior talent pool within the early stages of the league development.

 

RULE CHANGES

As we’ve already established, the league was still discovering itself and developing during MJ’s career, and as a part of that development, league rules were also a central part of that change. Now, I know what some of you are thinking, but before you start yell “hand checking, hand checking”, keep in mind, Jordan played during a time where the illegal defense rule existed. This is massive because hand checking is really nothing in comparison. The magnitude of the rule doesn’t compare to the significance of the illegal defense. Without the ability to play a zone defense or anything close to it, defensive schemes were less elaborate and teams were unable to send or even show multiple bodies at stars. Can you imagine a league nowadays in which superstars were left with single man coverages? That was the reality. Can you imagine players like Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Kevin Durant etc being able to basically go one-on-one with a defender who has been left there on an island with no hope in stopping them? It’s crazy when you think about that now in that light. Can you imagine some of the numbers the more modern superstars could have put up with that luxury.

 MAJOR STATISTICS INDICATE IT WAS IN FACT AN INFERIOR ERA AS WELL

You’d think that if the assumption Jordan played in a better era the numbers would back that up, right? Well they in fact do the opposite. Major stats taken across the board for the duration of his career indicate that Jordan did in fact play in an inferior era to today’s game. The overall Points Per game average was higher despite the fast-paced, more possessions per game we experience today. The Field Goals Made per game was higher, Field Goals attempted across the board were higher on average again despite the supreme pace we see night in and night out nowadays. The overall Field Goal Percentage was also higher. All in all, saving you some reading time, advanced stats are also not favorable. Not to mention basically everything that has to do with outside shooting, the three-point line and overall efficiency being better today.

INDIVIDUAL DEFENSE/DEFENSES

This is obvious, but simply put – individual and overall defense were less advanced when Jordan played. I often hear people claiming Jordan “would average 50 in this era”, but let’s be real, he wouldn’t average 50 (no one could do that), and even if he did average a high points per game average, it would be down to the increased pace and more possessions, not because the defenses or defensive players are worse now, because they’re not.

 JORDAN PLAYED FOR A HALL-OF-FAME HEAD COACH, AND WAS A PART OF THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS OF THEIR GENERATION

It’s no secret Jordan destroyed the competition, but it’s very interesting when they praise Jordan for dominating, but discredit today’s competition in comparison. It’s interesting because what people fail to realise is that Jordan played in the 90s version of the Golden State Warriors that we see tear apart the league today. Jordan’s Bulls were absolutely the equivalent in their era. Of course both teams were built and constructed differently, but their dominance and status were the same.",nbadiscussion

1277,282,How a Coin Flip and a Forgotten Check Changed NBA History Forever,"I would like to tell a story of which I have heavily researched and believe has a \*\*significant\*\* impact on all of NBA history (from 1969 forward). It is the story of how a coin flip and a forgotten check released the ultimate butterfly effect onto the NBA forever.

There will be a TLDR at the bottom and I will post a video essay version for visuals at the bottom, if anyone is interested in either.

Let's go back to 1969, big things were happening. The Celtics had just come off of their 11th championship in 12 years, The ABA was just beginning to find some ground, and America was getting ready to land on the moon for the first time in history.

While that was happening, something big was also happening in California- more specifically, UCLA. By ""big"" I mean 7 feet 2 inches, 225 LBS: Kareem Abdul Jabber.

In his freshman year he lead the bruins to a 33-0 record averaging 29 PPG on 67% shooting and won a national title, again, as a freshman! To give context to how dominant Kareem was, in his sophomore year, the NCAA banned dunking from college basketball, and a large part of that was because of Kareem. At this point in his basketball career believe it or not, he was pretty offensively limited, but it didn't matter. Anytime Kareem was within 4 feet of the basket it would be an instant dunk, offensive rebounds were easily 2 points, there was no one big or strong enough to think about altering anything Kareem did

[While the NCAA provided other reasons for the ban, like it being too damaging to back boards, It is widely accepted that Kareem played a big part in the ban.](https://youtu.be/Dt4UducROR4?t=103)

Unsurprisingly, his points per game did drop, but it did help Kareem develop his footwork and the shot he would become famous for- his sky-hook. So ultimately, this ban would help Kareem become the Kareem we know him as today: One of the most offensively polished centers in NBA history. He ended his college career with 3 national titles and 26 points per game at UCLA.

Now... this is where it gets really interesting.

At the end of the 1968 NBA season, we have 2 teams contending for the number one pick: The Milwaukee Bucks and Phoenix Suns who were 2 expansion teams coming off of their first season in the NBA. Up until the 1984 season, the number 1 pick was determined by a coin flip between the 2 teams with the worst record in each conference, and it was obvious who either would pick number 1. The suns asked to choose and the Bucks and Commissioner agreed. The Sun's owner, Jerry Colangelo, wanted to get the fans involved with the pick. So they did a poll in the newspaper and according to Jerry 51.2% of the fans voted to pick heads.

>“I wanted our fans to share in the win or the loss,” Colangelo says. “It was such a monumental, once-in-a-lifetime flip of a coin, why not let your fans be a part of that?”

The story continues as this:

From his office in New York, the commissioner of the NBA, James Kennedy, dialed up the 2 owners of the Bucks and Suns. They were both in their respective cities and the commissioner's office was in New York, so it was done via telephone.

>""Gentlemen, Kennedy began, ""I am going to put the receiver on my desk."" ""Then I will flip this coin in the air and catch it with my right hand and put it on the back with my left.""

Kennedy laid down the telephone, did exactly what he said he was going to do he flips it, it lands heads initially but he flips it over like he previously said he would, [and it is tails.](https://youtu.be/72d3762ro_w?t=63) The Bucks win the first pick of the 1969 NBA Draft.

Also after they won, the owner of the bucks grabbed the general manager so hard and hugged him that he jammed a lit cigarette into his ear. Jerry Colangelo also says he drove around town for hours trying to get himself together, it was absolutely devastating for the Sun's front office

**Sidenote:** The Bucks after selecting Kareem, went on to Draft Bob Dandridge in the 4th round with the 45th pick who would easily become the second best player inthe draft with his versatility scoring wise and also helped the Bucks improve along with Kareem and Oscar later.

**So there was a 50/50 Chance Kareem was a member of the Phoenix Suns and Milwaukee Bucks, let's take a moment to think about that.**

While the Phoenix suns roster wasn't anything special given their position, They did have 2 20 point per game scorers in Gail Goodrich and Dick Van Arsdale.

The next year they bring back those scorers, and obtain the rights to Connie Hawkins via a con flip between them and the Seattle SuperSonics, the 2nd and 3rd worst teams in the league did that as a consolation prize that year. This is not something that was standard, Connie Hawkins is a very unique situation which is too complex to explain in a short paragraph. To sum up, he was coming off of a wrongly issued ban from the NBA, and I assume that was the easiest way to get him into the league.

They improved from 16 wins to 39 wins with the Hawk pouring in almost 25 points a game along with Goodrich and Arsdale still scoring, but imagine replacing Connie Hawkins with the most dominant big man the NBA had ever seen at that time (they wouldn't have Connie Hawkins because it was consolation). Instead Goodrich is traded to the L.A Lakers and the sun's continue developing their young players and actually have some winning seasons. But what could have been with a different dominant big man guard combo with Goodrich and Kareem, the suns were a 50/50 coin flip away fromfinding out and being looked back as a respectable and dominant team in history. If they win that coin flip, Phoenix would most likely at least pick up 1 championship and Oscar Robertson would never have a title, thus changing his modern perception of kids who google ""Oscar Robertson Stats"" and move on.

The Bucks then select Kareem with the 1st of pick of the NBA draft, and so do the New York Nets with the 1st pick of the ABA draft

Kareem was raised in New York and attended college in California; he hated the idea of moving to the Midwest. He later wrote ""They were glad to have me in Milwaukee. but i wasn't the happiest guy in the world to be there.""According to Kareem, Milwaukee looked like ""a whole lot of red-necked farmers getting drunk.""

Also, At this point the Kareem has been approached by another organization: The Harlem Globetrotters. He was first offered 1 million dollars to play for them- which he declined, so this leaves 2 organizations - the NBA and ABA. According to Kareem's autobiography ""Giant Steps"" he wanted to play in the ABA for the nets, he grew up in new York and wanted to play near his family, along with the city's high Muslim population and he always was interested in being in a big market, hence him forcing a trade to the L.A Lakers later.

Still, both leagues needed him when I say both leagues needed him, I mean they NEEDED him, and they needed him to not be in their respective opposite leagues. For the NBA he was going to be next big star since Oscar Robertson and help the NBA's attendance problem, and if the ABA got him that early in their existence then it would have shown their league means business and even gotten a TV contract, which they never did, or it could have forced the NBA/ABA merger to happen even earlier, changing a lot of things in the NBA.

So both organizations got into a massive bidding war for Kareem's salary, which usually, would flatter anyone. But Kareem didn't like it. So he tells them he will hear their best possible offer from both sides and that is it. The ABA chooses their commissioner, George Mikan, to represent them and pitch their deal. Mikan said:

>""If he wants to play in Oshkosh or the moon, or anywhere between, we'll establish franchises there,"" he boasted. ""We want Lew and we'll give him anything he wants.""

The ABA's plan was to give him a check for 1 million straight up to show how serious they were, and discuss his actual salary from there. Also an even better unrelated George Mikan quote:

>""People will stand and cheer when they see our balls""

In reference to the red and white ABA ball, thank you George.

The NBA (Bucks front office) meets with him first. This part is all according to the Bucks General Manager (at the time) John Erickson

>We were in New York for what I thought was a get-acquainted session,"" Erickson recalled. ""(Alcindor) and his agent, Sam Gilbert, walked into the hotel room and asked us for an offer.""Well, we didn't have an offer. But I noticed that Lew appeared hungry, so I said, 'We've got a plan in mind, but we'd like a little time to work it into a firm offer.""""Let's go have lunch. Then, give us a couple of hours, come back and we'll present it to you.""""Lew thought that was a good idea. He wanted to do some shopping anyway, so it was agreed that they'd come back at 2 o'clock.""

While that happened, The Bucks team scrambled together an offer which was a guaranteed package of 1 to 5 years on his contract, and a salary of 1.5 million dollars which at that time, was ground breaking considering the Bucks payed 2 million dollars just to enter the league as an expansion team.

>""Lew liked that because it gave him some options,"" Erickson said. ""He wasn't sure that he wanted to play in Milwaukee. He'd said that he preferred to play in Los Angeles or New York.

Before we look at the final decision and why, let's go to the ABA's offer.

George Mikan meets with Kareem and his agent second. He has the check. They talk about numbers, about bringing in some of his old UCLA teammates and letting them play in New York, and while this all happens, **George Mikan** **never gives him the check. He forgets the check for 1 million dollars.** Along with this apparently they low balled the hell out of Kareem and his team leaves the meeting feeling insulted.

 In an interview with Sports illustrated a few months later, he revealed that:

>""The ABA had the inside track on me, but they had blown it""

After he felt he had heard both of the best offers, Kareem signed with the Bucks for 1.5 million 5 years. George Mikan quickly tried to run in with a 3 plus million dollar offer but Kareem is true to his word, and the rest is history. If Kareem had gone to the ABA, if George Mikan hadn't FORGOTTEN A 1 MILLION DOLLAR CHECK, Then like before, Oscar never gets a championship, and the '71 '72 and '74 at-least MVPs are different players and our modern perceptions on historic players today changes a whole lot. Kareem dominates the ABA instead of the NBA until the merger, thus heavily reducing his NBA resume and bringing him way down on people's ""all-time"" list.

The bucks go from 27 wins to 56, a 29 game improvement, and they win a championship in just their second year of having Kareem. He racks up 3 MVPs while on the Bucks and dominates the entire league. Although he later forces his way out to L.A, **That coin flip and that forgotten check from George Mikan changed everything forever.**

TLDR: The draft lottery until 1984 was determined by a coin flip and in 1969 the Phoenix Suns almost got Kareem. The NBA and ABA get into a massive bidding war over Kareem, but the ABA blows it and Kareem signs with the NBA

Thanks for reading/listening!


Edit: A lot of people are asking how someone ""forgets"" a check of 1 million dollars. All of the sources I found included the word forget, so I ran with that. Others have brought up points that he thought playing in New York would draw in him enough or he was withholding the check, all good points. Sadly I don't think we will ever know 100% unless someone there re-tells it.",nbadiscussion
1278,283,[OC] When a Mad Scientist's Experiment Finally Works: Why the Wizards of Washington Are Able to Score A Lot of Points,"Remember in old cartoons or kid's movies--where there is an eccentric villain with a plan to take over the world? It never worked out, that was kind of the point to every single storyline. Something would happen, the plan would fail and the day would be saved. But, hypothetically, if the plan worked, it would be devastating. 

That's kind of what it felt with the Scott Brooks offense--a confusing system, a high fail rate, difficult to execute finally worked. Now, we're left asking the simple question: how?

On paper, the Scott Brooks half-court offense is relatively simple. It starts around the perimeter. You'll also see one side being slightly bunched together, the other side a little more spread.  The unorthodox and somewhat clustered look allows for options. While they initially start centered around the top of the zone, slowly players will migrate across the floor--often times being facilitated through a high screen. It also meshes well with the early transition offense Brooks implements. 

In the past, the Wizards would simply spread out right away, leaving the offense to be reliant on penetration from John Wall, Bradley Beal or Tomas Satoransky . But over time or in the natural flow of the game, a migration emerges. Instead of the previous static stance, there is more fluidity with the offense. 

Its also easier to transition from defense. Again, the players naturally flow to a spot on the court. A player isn't stuck in a single spot anymore, there’s a lot of flexibility as to where someone can be on the court at a given time, they simply just have to just follow an open lane.

[Here's an hour long explanation from Brooks as to what the style is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2C7hZBh-Ts&t=2s). I'll be honest, I don't want to bore you with it and half of the times, Brooks will skip completing his point and its something that I sympathize with. 

Washington likes to move fast. They rank towards the quickest in the NBA at average Time of Possession (20 s), Average Time per Touch (2.75 s)  and Average Dribble Per Touch (2.07). The crazy thing: this isn't meaning they're finishing at the rim with their fast style of play. Which leads us back to the reason why they focus around the top of the half-court zone: they like the jump shot. 

The Washington Wizards average 17.5 attempts from mid-rage, 28.3 attempts from the top of the break and the 7th fewest amount of attempts in the paint (12.1 per game) , despite averaging the most field gold attempts per game (94.7). Its not that Washington isn’t able to get looks in deep in the zone, they just create a lot of shots outside. Over time, as teams inevitably cheat, it then creates more opportunities for Washington to punish.

Let’s just take a look at a couple of plays Washington likes to run. 

First, there is the simple screen and cut. [A simple high screen allows for Beal to turn on the jets, race towards the basket for a simple alley oop.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftQU02Rzhzs) It isn’t fancy, it isn’t specia,l its simply a well executed play created by this focused at the top of the zone.

[Another simple screen opens up Bertans for the lightly contested three pointer against the Suns](https://youtu.be/U-_E9TRB7JM?t=53). But what may be unnoticed is the important the early high screen to get the ball into the hands of Wagner. The play is meant to force Phoenix to react to a cutting Beal however its a ruse, the ball is going to a rounding Bertans for the three or the extra past into the corner for the wide open Jordan McRae.

If you cheat the drive, Rui Hachimura reminds you that the team will pull-up. [Movement at the top of the zone leads to Hachimura rolling into a position with space and drops a mid-range jumper on the former Spur Kawhi Leonard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeuNsK5Xd8U). 

*I also just wanted to showcase this highlight against the Lakers, a game where the Wizards really pulled off some incredible transition offense but the buckets didn't follow. In transition, Beal and Rui are able to get down the court. The Lakers do a pretty good job at preparing for the odd-man situation, Danny Green steps up to stop ball. The natural progression leads to a staggered split over loaded on one side while Wagner and Bertans read the lanes on the opposite side of the floor. Depending on how the Lakers collapse, the amount of options created shouldn't go unnoticed. First, you have the easy lay-up from Rui. Wagner cutting allows for a second option in-case the Lakers overcommit onto Rui. Bertans and IT sit around the perimeter for moral support and the possible three-point shot. Its just well executed with an ingenious design.*

And, of course, there is the ability to execute a high-screen pick and roll. [Mo Wagner was able to abuse this in his career high performance against the Timberwolves.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt7RFXr7I64).


It goes without saying that Bradley Beal has been the most important player for this latest version of the Wizards. But what has been a little bit crazy to realize is how he’s become a much better player as a ball dominant guard. In the past, he’s been a catch-and-shoot player. However, he’s now been recording better splits on unassisted attempts versus assisted attempts. He’s improved his assist-to-turnover ratio and his team-assist ratio for the 5th time in five years. And maybe my favorite statistic, he’s starting to go to the stripe more—around 7 times a game, and is hitting 83% of his free-throws—his best year ever.

Back to praising the organization, the Wiz have had a similar offensive system for sometime but not necessarily the talent. That has all changed. The key additions in the off-season changed the landscape of what the team is able to accomplish. Flexibility in their bigs has been something foreign to the district. Mo Wagner, Davis Bertans and Thomas Bryant and Rui Hachimura having the talent to spread out the floor has finally creating the natural spacing required for the system to work. In the past, the Wizards have attempted to strictly keep the role of the 5 as pick-and-roll master while the 4 acts as another wing presence.  Now, they can be seen all over the court.

Veterans Jordan McRae, Isaiah Thomas, C.J. Miles and Ish Smith have been able to provide meaningful minutes and not be complete liabilities. Overtime, we could see the younger talent pick-up more and more minutes but it does appear the likes of Admiral Schofield, Justin Robinson, Troy Brown Jr still have a lot of aspects of their games to develop. 


While the team is able to score *a lot* of points, the *system* is susceptible of creating additional opportunities for the opponents. Longer rebounds off of missed jump shots leads to an easy transition bucket for their opponents. Surprisingly, their half-court defense isn't terrible-despite giving up a lot of points. Thomas Bryant hasn't developed a strong rim-protector game--which still has left a gap in the Wizards defense--but its progression. Really, the key flaw in the half-court is great ball movement from their opponents or incredible iso play from a star that you just have to setback and appreciate.

There is still a lot of work to be done however some credit should be given: there's a foundation. In what could have been a critical year for the status of Scott Brooks as a NBA head coach, it has instead turned into a building point for the future. Its also a much more appealing take on the stylistic move we've seen in recent years when it comes to the NBA offense. While still not having the talent the contend with the greats, its a start.",nbadiscussion
1279,284,Overlooked reason on why Carmelo Anthony isn't on a team: Bench Players tend to have clear strenghts and playstyles. (Which he doesn't).,"First of all, let me say that many people do point out Carmelo isn't good at all in many areas, but I rarely see someone compare him to other bench players (who we can agree are on his level) and explain why he specifically isn't on a NBA roster.

&#x200B;

My point is that what teams look for in end-of-rotation players, in general, are clear strenghts and things they can add to the team. They usually are pretty good at certain things (nowadays those things tend to be either perimeter shooting, defense or rebounding), so they can actually help the team a lot in certain games instead of just being a presence on the court to score some points a game and that's it.

&#x200B;

We can see how this helps teams in the playoffs. Last year, Mike Scott had great games shooting from deep and was a tremendous player for a Sixers team that needed shooting, specially because their stars were below-average in that area. That guaranteed him a 2-year contract in the offseason even though he only averaged 8 points in 27 games with Philly. Another guy that performed really well in the playoffs was Kevon Looney, who was brought up in the court everytime the Warriors needed rebounding and a strong presence inside, and the result was a 3-year extension for the big-man.

&#x200B;

To exemplify this, I'll show my favorite team's bench and how this applies:

&#x200B;

Likely Mavericks bench rotation: Seth Curry, Maxi Kleber, Jalen Brunson, Justin Jackson, Dorian Finney-Smith and Boban Marjanovic. You can name each player's specialty, something they are above average at, easily. Seth is a pure sharpshooter and spaces the floor really well. Maxi brings defense and 3-point shooting as well. Jalen Brunson is a good guard with and without the ball, is really smart and can score decently. Jackson is long and has a perimeter shot. DFS is a long defender that can get boards. Boban brings size to the rotation and is a strong presence inside. You can do that with basically any roster.

&#x200B;

The thing with Carmelo is that he doesn't have that thing he's above average at. He's not a great shooter (35% from 3 in 6 attempts in the last 2 seasons while being really inconsistent), isn't athletic anymore, isn't either strong or fast for a foward, can't be efficient posting-up or slashing like he used to... The only area he is good for his position is rebounding, which he has been good at for his whole career. 

&#x200B;

GM's look for role-players that can fit their system or make up for their weaknesses in certain game-situations. Using Dallas as an example again, the Boban signing was basically an assurance that we have a big guy to match-up against tall players that Maxi, Powell or KP can't handle, or have a counter against 2 big rotations like the Lakers. Right now, the only reason a team would give Carmelo a shot is if they needed a foward to secure defensive boards, but how many teams are actually needing or caring about that? He isn't a good enough shooter for us to classify him as a ""sharpshooter"", and he certainly doesn't bring anything else to the table at an above-average rate.

&#x200B;

In certain specific cases, players can get a chance due to their age too. Young guys that aren't that good at anything get chances because they have potential. Vets can fill roster spots to bring a strong locker-room presence to the squad and mentor young lads. But that doesn't seem to be the case with Anthony neither. It looks like he just doesn't have a case anymore.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Teams look for players with specific strenghts, to make up for their weaknesses, when filling the last roster spots, and that's something that Melo isn't anymore.",nbadiscussion
1280,285,Ceiling Raising vs. Floor Raising in the NBA Playoffs,"One of the most interesting concepts in NBA analysis was first established (I think) by Ben Taylor of backpicks.com and the thinking basketball podcast. 

Ben talks often about the difference between raising a ceiling and raising a floor. For an example of the difference, compare peak Carmelo Anthony vs. Peak Kevin Durant. 

Carmelo was a fairly efficient volume scorer at his peak, capable of large improvements to the team offense whenever he was on the court. This raised his team's floor considerably. Put peak Carmelo on a bad to mediocre team and he's raising that team from 35 to 43 wins, or 43 to 50 wins. Those are important leaps to make, of course. 

But let's say you have a really good team already. Can peak Melo take you from 52 to 60? Can he bring enough defense, rebounding and spot up shooting to provide the same 7-8 win bump when the team doesn't need him to take 20 shots a game? Or, more importantly, can he contribute in smaller bursts on offense + whole game on defense at a superstar level in the NBA playoffs?

For Kevin Durant, the answer is a resounding yes. We saw it on the Warriors, where he played outstanding defense at times, protecting the rim, and produced at historic efficiency levels at the end of shot clocks and in transition. 

What I'm interested in discussing is **role players, ceiling raisers and floor raisers.** We instinctively use these concepts when we talk about 3 and D guys, but it goes deeper than that. 

I think it's interesting because we tend to be hyper focused on star production in the playoffs, sometimes at the exclusion of the role players who decide the series. For example, if Lu Dort shoots 4/9 on threes Monday I think OKC wins for the positive effect it has on the offense as well as the defense (getting to keep him in the game). But I promise the headlines in that scenario will be about CP3 and SGA! 

Here's one examples I thought of for the two types of players. Of course some guys are a mixture but it's still fun to think about. 

**CEILING RAISERS**

Marcus Smart - my thinking here is that Smart is probably top 5 most versatile defenders in the league while still being a reasonable capable point guard on offense. If he was on the Lakers I'd feel a LOT better about their chances in the coming gauntlent (likely to be Houston - clippers - bucks/Celtics). He wouldnt be as much of a floor raiser on the wizards, say, because the team defense would suck even with him and he would drag down the offense. Would he make them better? Yes. But I feel he would contribute quantitatively more to winning on a great team.


**FLOOR RAISERS** 

Domantas Sabonis - This is not an insult, and I feel terrible that Sabonis missed the playoffs due to injury. However, I think his counting stats + All Star selection have led some people to overrate him. Sabonis basically runs the Pacers half court offense when he's in - operating from the elbow and running everything through him. There is tons of value in that! *For the Pacers.* Because on a team with truly high level creators - say, Clippers or Lakers or Bucks - he wouldn't get to run the offense, because the guys who do it are better than he is and more efficient. Plus, he isn't an amazing three point shooter although he's money from the mid range. Ironically, his teammate Myles Turner is sort of the opposite - you can't run an offense through him but he would kick serious ass as a 3 & D center on a true contender.",nbadiscussion
1281,286,The complete failure of the 2019 off-season for the Knicks a breakdown from a angry fan,"
It is so hard being a fan of the knicks sometimes. I’m never going to leave, NYC/loyalty/Stockholm syndrome. But thinking about the moves we made this off-season has me angry. We completely failed with team construction this year.

##What was the goal of our team for the 2019-2020 season?

**Make the playoffs?** Absolute joke

**Sign trade assets to trade for value for long-term moves?** Would have have been nice to actually trade those assets and after the deadline have our young players play. 

**Try to improve on what we have and be competitive?** I think that was the goal? Would’ve been nice if the young players got some minutes, at the very Best that’s a unsatisfactory grade.

In every single scenario for those questions, their was a better move we could’ve made without hindsight needed.

Part of the reason I believe Mitchell Robinson and RJ Barrett have been so disappointing this season were the absolute disasters of free agent signings we wasted our cap space on, -Marcus Morris I will never say anything bad about that man. 

What makes wasting the cap space worse for me is I cannot justify trading Porzingis anymore which I would love to do.

#Players we signed, why we shouldn’t have signed them, player, other options available

###Bobby Portis

A Young Center/Power Forward than that provides no mentorship for Mitchell Robinson and is worse than him now. In a vacuum I can understand why you would sign a stretch big who is a young player. However understanding personal and team construction is important. Bobby Portis had a reputation of being a hothead and is a young player who is worse than Robinson. I don’t understand the value of signing him especially when these other options were available.

**Players who are stretch bigs that got equal value or less**

Brook Lopez who got significantly less and played and New York before.

Jonas Valanciunas, a better player than Bobby Portis, young stretch five Who is greatly contributing to a playoff team and has a excellent reputation with both raptors and grizzlies fans.

What is worse is we already had a young stretch big that was significantly cheaper on the roster 

Luke Kornet who signed under 3 mil for 2 years in Chicago. For the value both Bobby and Luke Kornet provide, Luke is clearly better, not the better player the better, value.

###Taj Gibson

I understand why we signed him see the value of a veteran like him on our roster but not for the price tag or role he has. **A starting center???** if he was a back up power forward/small ball center for certain line ups, got paid for half of what he got I’d have no complaints. He’s from New York and like the idea of Knick fans playing for the team but for that price tag?

**Starting caliber centers that got less**
Just a highlight the overpay not even going to put equal value 

Robin Lopez, former Knick, would provide respectable minutes when Robinson gets in foul trouble and we could justify starting over. 

Dwight Howard, despite character concerns, would be perfect mentor for the shotblocking prodigy Robinson is. Dwight Howard was under contract for $5 million on the Grizzles that didn’t want him and almost any trade we would’ve offered would’ve been preferable to them than a buyouts, even if it was just The rights to some international player, the cap space would’ve been valuable for the grizzlies. Dominant big man in his prime 4x DPOY, currently one of the better traditional big men in the league.  Dwight Howard mentoring Mitchell Robinson like DeAndre did could’ve led to a more productive sophomore season. If not he provided someone to go against in practice which would help him develop as well.

JaVale McGee shot blocker who had his issues as a young player and could’ve use that experience to help Mitchell Robinson develop. Respectable shot blocker.

We could’ve literally signed one of these players with Taj Gibson instead of just over paying Taj Gibson. If Taj Gibson didn’t want to be on the knicks at that value I am not losing sleep over that.

###Julius Randle

I actually liked the move at the time but I am not a front office employee and was just thirsty for young talent. I didn’t use any critical thinking, just liked the idea of a 24 year old power forward who averaged  21/9. Julius Randle has been an absolute disaster on our team. He has become an utter joke to us Knick fans. We refer to him as Julius “spin Move turnover” Randle, and “Beyblade”. Knowing who we drafted and who our best young player was(Mitchell Robinson) why on earth would we send a significant amount of cap space on a young player that does not fit with our best young players? 

**Acceptable uses of that cap space for a similar amount or less, would’ve been a better fit, that would probably have the same amount trade value as Randle**
Harrison Barnes, Bojan Bogdanovich, Jeremy Lamb, Rudy Gay.

**Here are other young players who signed we could’ve signed that have more upside, have more trade value, better fit and frankly better players.**
Kelly Oubre Jr, D’Angelo Russell, Malcolm Brogdon

Not signing D’Angelo Russell especially is the most unforgivable giving the fact the Timberwolves were incredibly thirsty for him and could’ve netted us a lottery first round pick even if we didn’t like his play with us. D’Angelo Russell and Frank Ntilikina point guard rotation could’ve been exciting if we wanted to retain him, Need a bucket put in D’Lo need a stop put Frank in. 

At the time before the offseason if we didn’t get KD/Kyrie, I wanted re-sign DeAndre Jordan for One year with a player option. He might’ve left for the Nets anyway but I can see al the incentive for him to choose to stay on the Knicks, as he can still live in the city and hang out with his friends while he got overpaid by us for 20 to 25 mil for one season, us(with an option of retaining him if we strike out in this years offseason). He the could’ve gotten paid a respectable amount by the nets the next offseason with KD and Kyrie in the front offices ear. And unlike other overpays we did it, would’ve actually served a purpose. Look at Mitchell Robinson’s [stats after the DeAndre Jordan trade](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/robinmi01/gamelog/2019/#36-66-sum:pgl_basic), Almost a double double with 3 blocks a game! 29 consecutive games of blocking 2 or more shots. He was extremely important to Mitchell Robinson‘s development last year and was a great veteran for him to have, if we are going to overpay a vet that is going to start over a young player let it serve a purpose. 


###Elfrid Payton

Was just an unnecessary signing entirely. 
Does he have more upside than Frank Ntilikina? No
Is Payton significantly better than Frank or provide a better value on the court for our teams future? No 
I might be in the minority but I think Frank is just flat out better than Elfrid Payton, but even if I am wrong you cannot convince me Elfrid Payton wasn’t a wasted signing. His value added playing any is not more than the value of Frank playing. Even if you don’t like Ntlikina last year, Always made great passes and despite not having good assist Numbers capable playmaker, leading the Team in hockey assists. Frank Ntilikina has always been the better defender his rookie season he was the best pick and roll defender and even after a season played with injuries were still a above average defender last year. He clearly progressed as a player this season and clearly believe Frank provided better value playing then Elfrid Payton.

Elfrid Payton is somehow is a ball hog despite his reputation as a playmaker only passing it to Julius “spin move turnover” Randle. He isn’t a three point shooter, so we didn’t sign him for spacing and isn’t an offensive threat. 
He had a couple triple doubles cool, so did Dennis Smith Jr. and despite my issues with Dennis he clearly has more upside than Payton with more trade value. 

Signing Payton was a bad idea, promising him a starting role worse idea. Even if you don’t believe in your young point guards, I don’t see the value of adding a “proven vet” to play over those two recent lottery picks. why not give them an opportunity to prove you wrong. From a pragmatic standpoint to get maximum trade value, have them play significant minutes for highlights, stats and flashes that might convince a team to trade for them, rather than have them benched for a guard of Payton’s caliber. 

If you absolutely wanted a veteran point Guard to start over the prospects to make them “earn it”, then at the very least sign someone who offered spacing with playmaking abilities to run an offense effectively and utilize the other young players we had. 

*If You wanted to sign he starting caliber point guard that offseason* 

Derrick Rose (three-point percentage this year isn’t what it was last year but I’m not using hindsight), despite a uninspiring 2016-17 year with us signing Derrick Rose would’ve made sense  Derrick Rose is prime is the best,and currently unlikely, case scenario for Dennis Smith Jr. having a player like Derrick Rose to mentor him would’ve provided great value over Payton. Despite not wanting him to re-sign for the 2017- 2018 season thinking that he was washed immature former star who wouldn’t adapt to a different role, would be bad for young players development and wouldn’t serve any value for us he proved me wrong on all fronts and I’m not ashamed to admit it. He was a great vet for Minnesota and Detroit. He wouldn’t be offended at reduced minutes either given his history and that would allow us to play Frank and Dennis for significant minutes on top of having a veteran starting point guard with trade value.

###Wayne Ellington and Reggie Bullock

They were so low impact they getting grouped together. Just why? We had Damyean Dotson who was the same caliber of shooter as them, and Allonzo Trier who shot a better percent from 3. Both of those Young players have more upside could shoot and are on the last year on their contracts. What was the point of signing and playing lower tier shooters that have no future on a rebuilding team over player who we need to decide if they are going to be in our future and what they are worth. If you were convinced they had no future with then why didn’t we trade them for value at the deadline? What was the point? Waste 12 million in cap space and waste the young players value on the bench souring our relationship with them if we want re-sign them. Just illogical and dumb they provided no value and was just a waste.

###Now for Traded we could have made accepting salary dumps that would’ve netted us assets

Andre Iguodala a 2024 warriors 1st round pick 

Moe Harkless 2023 Miami 1st round pick

Tony Snell the Buck’s 30th pick 2019

TJ Warren the suns 32nd pick 2019 

Josh Jackson a 2020 2nd and a conditional second 

[And according to](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2019/06/20/report-rockets-tried-to-give-away-chris-paul-but-teams-including-knicks-said-no/) [multiple different](https://clutchpoints.com/knicks-rumors-new-york-refused-rockets-offer-trading-chris-paul-into-cap-space/) [articles and media personal ](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2838533-5-teams-who-could-try-to-land-chris-paul)
We could’ve traded for Chris Paul. 
Let me say at the time was completely against this but that was a result of being burned too many times of acquiring washed former stars. Imagine Mitchell Robinson being thrown lobs by Chris Paul or RJ Barrett learning under Chris Paul like Shia Gilgeous Alexander learned under him. It would’ve been a lot more fun than watching the players we did sign.

So let me ask again What was the goal of our team for the 2019-2020 season?

**Make the playoffs?**

If that was the goal we should’ve traded for Chris Paul, Dwight Howard, and TJ warren signed Melo (vet min PF) and tried 

CP3
RJ
TJ
Melo
Mitchell Robinson/Dwight 
A bench of Dotson, Trier, Frank, DSJ, Knox and Trier seems more likely to make the playoffs then the product we rolled our 

**Sign trade assets to trade for value for long-term moves?**

Literally every free agent except for Marcus Morris we signed shouldn’t have been signed. Marcus Morris thankfully got us something but we should’ve either signed D’Angelo Russell, Oubre, Malcolm Brogdon that definitely worth first round picks. Or Accept the salary dumps we potentially could’ve gotten gotten an extra 3 1st round picks productive player on great contract TJ warren. Moe Harkless Tony snell could have been our PF that was genuinely a position of need last off-season. Take a Flyer in Josh Jackson and potentially trade Iggy for Winslow That would’ve been the best possible use of Space if that was our goal. 

**Try to improve on what we have and be competitive?**

If this was the goal we should’ve signed players that actually fit our roster, possible moves we could have made listed above.

Overall The Knicks on almost every level completely blew the off-season. we could’ve signed young players that fit with our team and timeline Veterans that fit our team with a long term benefit. We completely blew the off-season the cap space we had was completely wasted and now need to trade Julius Randle.

# **TLDR:**

We made pointless moves that didn’t make us better in the short term nor help us in the long term. We signed two low impact veteran shooting guards, that are worse than our young shooting guards we didn’t play to justify instead of accepting the sunken cost. Overpaid 2 young players that don’t fit with our best young players and don’t offer much in terms of trade value compared to other options we could have made in the offseason. Didn’t utilize our cap for optimal team construction regardless of what our goals were.",nbadiscussion
1282,287,"If Rudy Gobert doesn't make the all-star team this season, would he be the best player in NBA history to never make an all-star appearance?","[Serious] 

I'll preface this by saying that I'm clearly a biased Jazz fan but I think he would have an incredible case to be made for it.  
  
In 2016-17 he had a better season than DeAndre Jordan but missed out. This was likely because the 4th seeded Clippers *deserved* an all-star and their other players were injured. It was also a sort of lifetime achievement award for DJ and the 5th seeded Jazz didn't *deserve* another allstar alongside Hayward.  
  
In 2018-19 Gobert had another incredible season culminating in a second DPOY and a second All NBA appearance. However he was once again controversially snubbed from the all-star game. Despite ranking in the top 3 in the league in win shares and dominating a tone of advanced defensive stats as well as leading the Jazz to another playoff appearance he missed out.  
 
In 2019-20 Gobert is currently the best player on a Utah Jazz team that currently holds the 3rd best record in the NBA. He's averaging 15 points and 15 rebounds and converting a crazy 68% of his field goal attempts. His defence has improved even more and he's become an even better perimeter defender. He also leads the league in dunks for a second consecutive season.  
  
Now there have been players like Lou Williams, Mike Conley and Jason Terry who have had longer careers and never made an All Star appearance. However I don't think there were any seasons where they were specifically ""snubbed"". More so they were great players just on the fringe of allstar level.  
  
So on that note what do you guys think? Some people may consider Gobert a lock but as a Jazz fan I'm still worried about another possibile snub. If anything he could miss due to Mitchell being a more entertaining player and the Jazz being deemed to not *deserve* two all-stars.

- **[ 🟢 Passing Prodigy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wmKj41_kTc) (9.0 Passer Rating - 4th among players >1000MP; 9.8 Box Creation)**: 

JOKER is the best playmaking big in NBA history and one of the best passers in the league, full-stop and without caveat - Big Honey's vision is reminiscent of a 7-foot Magic Johnson. He makes every single pass in the playbook quickly and accurately, never looking at his target in order to throw off defenders, adroit at using his eyes to manipulate defenses. His [outlet passing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0CZ_4odpew) is the envy of any point-guard - throwing [outlets like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De1OSDcb2fw) *mid-rebound* is unfair. 

[Jokić runs Denver's offense from the high-post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDA0UMksDSE), as the Nuggets' bevy of guards and wings whir around him for DHOs and PnRs. He rarely ever misses high-% layup-passes, and his otherworldly vision (helped by his 7ft frame allowing him to see over defenders) encourages his teammates to move and cut off the ball because he'll almost certainly get the ball to them the moment they make themselves open - there is good reason why Denver's offensive rating spikes by almost 4 points the moment Jokić enters the game. 

Joker's height and wingspan allow him access to passing lanes not available to most guards and wings, deftly flicking it to teammates around the outstretched arms of defending bigs. He can lob to his more athletic teammates, pitch bounce-passes to cutters through the tiniest of passing windows, no-look skip-passes to 3P-shooters, and is even capable of blending in passes with his shooting motion as he reads the help and rifles the ball neatly into a wide-open teammate's shooting/scoring pocket. These are *difficult* passes, often barely squeezing through a forest of enemy limbs, which puts a lot of pressure on opponent defenses. Jokić is fantastic at anticipating where his teammates will be and throwing his dimes to an area *in front of* his teammates so that they can nab the ball comfortably while they're still running at full-speed. For me, Nikola Jokić is right up there as one of the finest passers in the game.

Jokić's scoring comprises his [highly versatile post-game](https://stats.nba.com/players/playtype-post-up/?SeasonType=Regular%20Season), combined with an assortment of **jumpers***(46 midrange-FG%, 31 3P%)* and rim-finishes. Jokić rarely ever dunks, but don't his lack of athleticism fool you - he's got excellent touch in the paint, mixing in **floaters and hooks** *(60 FG% from ""floater-range"", 3-10 ft, which is* ***elite;*** *Joker is the most accurate scorer from this zone in the league!)*, along with throwing his weight around in the **post** and pump-faking defenders into oblivion to obtain easy looks at the **rim** *(elite 73 FG% from 0-3 ft)*. Nikola also likes following his own (or his team's) misses - he has 3 **offensive rebounds** a game *(top-20 in playoff ORB%)*. My personal favourite part of Joker's scoring arsenal, however, is his seemingly-unguardable [""Sombor Shuffle""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pBNvlzz6N0), where he backs down his defender in the post before wrong-footing a turnaround midrange fadeaway that almost never seems to miss when Denver needs a score late in games. 

---


- ***🟢 ""How 'bout another Joke, Murray?""***: 

[Jokić boasts excellent offensive chemistry with **Jamal Murray**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu6Ie8t8TEk), often hooking up with Denver's 23 y/o star combo-guard for a variety of handoffs, pick-and-pops, and give-and-gos. In the playoffs, some teams (see: the Clippers) have started doubling Murray in the perimeter on account of his red-hot shooting at the moment *(48 3P%, 7.6 3PA/game)*, but if Jamal successfully beats the trap and gets the ball to his big man, Big Honey has been [*shredding* teams on the short-roll, feasting on these 4-on-3 powerplays with his vision, manipulation, and sublime passing --- recently, he destroyed the Clippers' vaunted perimeter defense with an out-and-out passing clinic in the 2nd-half of a comfortable game 7 win after LAC started doubling him and Murray out of desperation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J9_O5bOtm0). Together, Jokić and Jamal are beating heart of Denver's robust, adaptable, motion-heavy offense *(+2.5 rORTG, +2.9 playoff rORTG)*.

---

- **🟢 Not a bad team defender!**: 

Sound positioning and great hands(healthy steal rate for a big, ~2%) + Jokić's size, length, and activity allow him to retain good value on defense.  Reads situations well and acts accordingly, clogging driving lanes and bothering offensive plays with his length. Denver's defensive rating (16th in NBA) improved by +2.4 points when he was on the court this season.

---

- **🟢 CLUTCH**: 

The official NBA Stats website defines ""clutch-time"" as the final 5 minutes of the game, assuming the point differential between the two teams is 5 points or less.

With that in mind, Joker ranked [2nd in points scored in the clutch this season](https://stats.nba.com/players/clutch-traditional/?Season=2019-20&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&PerMode=Totals&sort=PTS&dir=-1), only behind Chris Paul, and the Nuggets were [2nd](https://stats.nba.com/teams/clutch-traditional/?sort=W&dir=-1&Season=2019-20&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) in the league in clutch wins, with a 29-16 record (64.4 win%) in clutch situations. In the clutch, Jokić has a [personal net rating of +18.2, a sterling 2.7 AST/TO ratio, and shoots efficiently --- 61 TS%](https://stats.nba.com/players/clutch-advanced/?sort=GP&dir=-1). (The team's excellence late in the 4th quarter has continued in the **playoffs** - Denver are 4th in clutch net-rating, +26.4, and they've won 6 of their 9 close games. Jokić himself - small-sample-size alert! - has a blistering clutch net-rating of +30, scoring on sparkling efficiency - 78 TS%.) 

Whether it be [methodically bullying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K128aO6gY-w&t=1m43s) his way to the basket for a contested finish ([*or, you know, an unguardable hook-shot over a certain DPOY-runner-up*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LESkHtciOp0&t=3m5s) in the dying seconds of a playoff game), a [game-winning tip-in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfD00ZUOINU), or one of his [patented wrong-footed fadeaways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzEilNDSh-c) (*~~cries in Sixers~~*), simply giving the ball to Big Honey late in the 4th has proven to be winning formula for Denver.

---

- **🟢 Playoff performer**: 

Jokić has elevated his scoring and overall production in both of his playoff runs thus far, averaging 25/11/7 on 61 TS% in his playoff career *(9.3 BPM)*, up from 20/10/7 on 60 TS% in his past two regular-seasons *(8.3 BPM)*. 

-  **🟢 Playoff 3P-shooting**: 

Jokić has been a deadeye 3-point shooter in the postseason, hitting *41.5%* of his 4.7 attempts per game over his 31 playoff games thus far. He's toasted teams on pick-and-pops and catch-and-shoot jumpers, dragging rim-protectors out of the paint and stretching opponent defenses thin, allowing Denver's guards and wings to reap the benefits of the open lanes Joker's shooting helps create for them.

---

- **🟢 Fantastic durability/stamina**: 

Jokić has always been highly durable and available, having yet to miss a single game this season. He's missed a grand total of 20 games in his entire 5-year career. 

Don't be fooled by his large frame or his awkward gait - Joker's conditioning is also excellent, averaging 38 minutes/game in the playoffs (e.g. he played *64 minutes and 58 seconds* in the legendary [Nuggets-Blazers 4OT-game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7MM9tYTPE) last playoffs).

---

#**🔴🔴 The not-as-good 🔴🔴**

---

- **🔴 Subpar rim-defense**: 

Jokić doesn't offer too much in the way of rim-protection *(low block rate for a big, opponents shoot a pretty high 63 FG% in the paint when Jokić is the nearest defender)*, lacking verticality on his contests. This doesn't mean he isn't *active* on defense - he simply lacks the speed and athleticism to consistently and effectively contest the league's better rim-finishers. 

Although, as mentioned previously, Jokić's good positioning and size/length plus IQ/anticipation make him an adequate/decent team defender, often making smart rotations to stall opponent forays to the rim. He's elevated his block rate both years in the playoffs, too, *(0.6➡️0.9 blocks/game)*, suggesting Big Honey has some rim-protecting potential when dialled-in.

-  **🔴 Subpar perimeter-defense**: 

Jokić suffers from some lead-footedness when switched onto non-bigs. His relative lack of speed in closeout situations also leaves him vulnerable to good pullup jumpshooters in the PnR. 

A notable recent example: some of this was clearly due to Denver missing their ace perimeter-stopper Gary Harris, but Utah's All-Star guard Donovan Mitchell feasted on Denver's drop coverage featuring Jokić during the brilliant Jazz-Nuggets 1st-round playoff series this year, canning a ridiculous *51.0% of his 51 pullup 3s* (up from 32 pullup-3P% in the regular-season) in those 7 games.

---

- **🔴 Inconsistent regular-season 3P-shooting**: 

This is just a minor knock, but Jokić's outside shooting during the regular-season has been surprisingly inconsistent (31.4 3P% this season, 33.8 3P% over his career). I am not entirely sure why this is the case --- i) his form is good, ii) he shoots amazingly in the playoffs (40 3P% on nearly 5 attempts/game), and iii) the vast majority (~94%) of his attempts have been either open or wide-open. Even more bafflingly, Nikola had one season (2017-18) when he shot 39.6% from 3, but aside from that, he's shot 33.3%, 32.4%, 30.7%, and 31.4%. Regardless of what the numbers say, however, opponent teams certainly respect him from deep, making Jokić a viable pick-and-pop threat and floor-spacer for Denver at the 5.

---

- **🔴 Is Big Honey perhaps** ***too*** **selfless on offense?**: 

Jokić could probably afford to call on his own number *slightly* more often when it comes to scoring. I doubt his coaches or teammates would *mind* him scoring more, given how efficient and unselfish he normally is. Jokic is clearly capable of elevating his scoring in the playoffs, as previously mentioned; perhaps this is simply a case of *me* being selfish as a fan and wishing him to assert himself more as a scorer in the regular-season.

#**🟢🟢 The Good 🟢🟢** 

---

- **🟢 Excellent Volume-Scorer --- 27.8 points per 75, on ~ +5 rTS% (29.0 per 75, +8 rTS% in playoffs):** 

AD has a highly-adaptable scoring arsenal, capable of shifting his offensive game to fit cleanly within different offensive schemes (e.g. higher pace in NOLA vs. LeBron's more methodical half-court style). He possesses a [variety of **post-moves**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5AbcB4AkFM), hooks, spins, fakes, stepbacks, turnarounds, etc. (he uses his spin-move in particular quite often); he also has a passable **face-up** game with a decent handle, capable of moving like a guard and athletic finishes in the **paint** *(74FG% in restricted area, 40FG% from ""floater range"")*. AD is also a monster on the **offensive glass** *(9th in playoff ORB%)*, and his aggressiveness near the rim leads to one of the highest **free-throw** rates in the league *(9.5 playoff FTA/game, 0.539 playoff FTr)*.  

Davis is skilled at leaking out in **transition** to receive LeBron's/Rondo's outlet passes or getting easy offensive boards before the defense has the change to fully recover *(90th percentile among transition scorers)*, and he's also a mean **roll-man** in the PnR *(~80th percentile)*. In isolation, Davis is a walking mismatch, too quick for many bigs but too big for many wings*(~70th percentile)*. AD is likely [one of the best **off-ball** big men ever](https://i.imgur.com/UKgDGt4.png), considering the volume and diversity of his scoring package: he can roll to the rim like a big, come off pindowns to can jumpshots like a guard, and fake screens and handoffs to **cut** to the rim like a wing *(playoffs: 82% percentile as cutter, 12th in cutting-frequency)*, catching his defenders off-guard. His **activity** off-the-ball was on full display during his game-winner against the Nuggets a few days ago: [look at how he takes advantage of momentary defensive hesitation by the Nuggets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgzWHIXw6Ho&t=19s) to sprint to the opposite wing and catch-and-shoot a deep 3 off-movement. 

---

- **🟢 Vertical-Spacer**: 

AD is an **all-time lob-finisher** *(76 FG% from 0-3 feet)*. Davis's catch-radius is one of the best in NBA history --- just throw it up in the general direction of the rim and he'll make it work somehow with his touch and athleticism. AD can catch at challenging angles and finish through considerable traffic. His addition to the Lakers is a major reason why LeBron's leading the league in assists (2.8 of LeBron's 10.6 assists/game go to AD). It's an underrated part of his game as it allows him to fit with and **scale** well on a variety of offenses and mesh well with just about any other ball-dominant star in the league.


- **🟢 Passable-to-Decent Catch-and-Shoot 3P/Midrange Shooter**: 

34.4% on catch-and-shoot 3s this season *(33.3% in playoffs)*, and 37.7% last season. This enables Lakers to go ""small"" and 5-out with AD at C, spacing the floor to give everyone some breathing room on offense. He also shoots a few catch-and-shoot midrangers, which he's decent at *(40fg% regular-season, 59fg% playoffs)*.


---

- **🟢 Decent Passer**(4.5 Passer Rating, 5.3 Box Creation): 

This is mostly based on his last season at New Orleans, which was his peak year as a passer *(Passer Rating >6)*. In the 2019 season, with their starting PGs missing significant time due to injury, the Pelicans leaned on Jrue Holiday's versatile playmaking gifts more, but they also parked AD in the high post and ran offense through him from there, letting him weaponise his own threat to score by feeding cutters with neat interior pocket passes or spraying kickout passes to shooters when he got doubled. He averaged 4.4 assists and only 2.0 turnovers prior to his trade request, producing a very efficient 2.2:1 AST/TO ratio. However, AD's playmaking has regressed this season *(only 3.3 APG, uninspiring AST/TO ratio of 1.25:1)* as he's gone more off-ball than in 2019 with LeBron manning point full-time in LA.

---

- **🟢 The Brow-Bron Connection**: 

As we've alluded to earlier, the LeBron-AD connection has been even better than fans and analysts likely imagined it would be coming into the season--- **of all 2-man assist-combos in the league this year,** [**James to Davis ranks 1st by a vast margin**](https://www.pbpstats.com/assist-combo-summary/nba?Season=2019-20&SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason), with 172 assists between the two leading the league, far ahead of Lillard-Whiteside with 130 and Lou-Trez with 127. 

LeBron hits AD in a variety of ways: in the pick-and-roll, with lobs and snappy interior dishes; pick-and-pop or drive-and-kick, with AD positioned in the midrange or out on the 3-point line; simply dumping it to AD in the post and letting him go to work; [**hitting AD quickly and accurately in transition as part of a new-age ""Showtime""**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdr3h7YvkSE&t=35s) ; in semi-transition, or off made-field goals, LeBron lets AD leak out early in the shot clock to establish good post position quickly, and then hits him with a long-range outlet pass so that AD can ISO against an unprepared defense. The Lakers often get 1-2 buckets per game in this fashion alone.

---

- **[🟢 DPOY-level Defender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcN63RM4BMs)**: 

Davis finished 2nd in DPOY-voting this season, only behind the Greek Freak. AD's weakside rim-protection is elite - the Lakers have had a top-3 defense *(-4.3 rDRTG)* due in no small part to his efforts. He's highly switchable, too, capable of jumping onto guards and wings as required and scaring them silly *([67.3 Versatility Index, spending ~30% of his possessions guarding PGs/SGs/SFs, ~40% on PFs, and ~30% on Cs](https://i.imgur.com/q2v40v3.png))*. His motor has been excellent and he closes out hard on shooters. He's handsy as well, with good defensive instincts- he has a good eye for anticipating plays and jumping passing lanes. His steal-rate is elite for a big *(1.5stl/game, 14th in NBA; 2.0stl%, 5th among bigs)*, and he hasn't gambled too much this year, either - his length and IQ enable him to plague nearby passing lanes without surrendering his defensive-positioning. He often cleans up mistakes by teammates, making sound backline rotations and allowing them the freedom to play aggressive defense on the perimeter because they know that he's always got a watchful eye out to pounce on any perpetrators who make it past them. 

In isolation situations, AD can more than hold his own *(83rd percentile in ISO-defense, an incredible figure for a big, allowing a measly 0.71 PPP according to Synergy)* -- players shoot 8.4% worse overall when AD is the closest defender *(6% worse on 3s, 10% worse on 2s)*. Davis is an all-time [defensive playmaker](https://i.imgur.com/hBnsH21.png): the 12th player ever with a 6%-block% and 2%-steal%, with 2020  being his *5th* such season achieving this feat *(only behind 2-time DPOY Hakeem Olajuwon, who notched 9 such seasons over his career)*. AD works well in tandem with the Lakers bigs (Dwight/McGee) so that if either of them gets beat, he is still in position to protect the rim. The Lakers' defensive rating weirdly improved when AD sat during the regular-season, because the success of LeBron-led bench-units seemingly ended up suppressing Davis's on/off numbers. 

While we're talking about on/off, it's worth noting too that the script has absolutely flipped in the **playoffs** --- in the 465 minutes played *with* AD on the court, the Lakers have been a mind-boggling *13.2 points better on defense*. Davis's versatile defensive skillset has enabled the Lakers to slow down and overwhelm two very different offensive powerhouses in the playoffs: in the 1st round against the 3rd-ranked, PnR-heavy Portland offense *(113.7 regular-season ORTG ➡️ 104.6 ORTG against Lakers;* ***drop of -9.1ortg)*** ; and in the 2nd round against the 6th-ranked, small-ball, ISO-heavy Houston offense *(112.9 regular-season ORTG ➡️ 103.8 ORTG against Lakers;* ***drop of -9.1ortg)***. Davis rates [excellently](https://old.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/gnd7ej/giannis_antetokounmpo_vs_anthony_davis_for_the/) on the vast majority of available impact-metrics, which may actually underrate AD since his plus-minus was underwhelming despite his brilliant defensive play.

---

- **🟢 Playoff Performer**: 

AD's scoring has translated excellently to the playoffs- he has averaged 28.0 points per 75 on ~ +6 rTS% in his 6 playoff series thus far, with terrific ancillary stats. He's currently in the midst of a remarkable conference-finals run -  [he ranks 2nd in the league in playoff Backpicks BPM](https://twitter.com/ElGee35/status/1307708292324499456). 

---

- **🟢 Surprisingly healthy this season!**: 

Durability is generally considered a weakness of AD's (see [here](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/anthony-davis-player-injuries)), but he's only missed 9 games this season. Encouraging news!

---

#**🔴🔴 The not-as-good 🔴🔴**

---

- **🔴 Average-to-mediocre overall shooting profile (regular-season)**: 

33.3 3P% and ***35.7 midrange-FG% over his past 3 seasons***, weighed down by subpar pullup-shooting (his catch-and-shoot game is okay, as we mentioned earlier). Nevertheless, AD's pullup 3-point/midrange shooting is certainly a value-add to his **versatility** as a scorer, that helps him keep defenses honest when they give up open jumpers. Also, Davis can get hot --- he's shooting a scorching ***49 FG% from midrange*** **in the playoffs** at the moment.

- **🔴 Occasional Shot-selection concerns**: 

AD has a slightly-frustrating tendency to settle for taking contested midrange jumpshots at times, which he (this current playoff run excepted) isn't generally that great at hitting. This is a forgivable trait, however, given how efficient the rest of his game is. 

---

- **🔴 Passing/playmaking limitations**: 

Davis's passes can be a bit slow or tentative at times, and he sometimes misses the shooting pocket altogether, leading to turnovers -- passing windows in the NBA close within miliseconds so he could be more decisive or put more velocity on his dimes.  He doesn't always *anticipate* openings, either, rarely making more advanced reads.

- **🔴 Ability to run an offense?**: 

It remains to be seen whether AD can run an efficient team offense as a *primary initiator*, like a slasher like Giannis/LeBron/Kawhi or a full-time high-post operator like Jokić in Denver or Kevin Garnett back in the day on the Wolves. Perhaps further improving his handle or his strength will allow him to do so, since he already proved he possesses decent playmaking vision in New Orleans last year. When LeBron's been off the court this season, AD's decision-making on-the-ball has been inconsistent at times. Even so, as things stand, the Lakers still have a good offense *(+3.9 rORTG in playoffs)* with AD playing primarily off-ball, so I doubt that's going to change much in the foreseeable future. 

---

- **🔴 Some areas for improvement on defense**: 

AD ball-watches every so often, though greatly-improved from last season. Quicker guards can still occasionally blow by him. Doesn't have *perfect* footwork. Misses the odd help scenario. Gambles sporadically for steals, though it works out for him more often than not. Power-players (the Embiid's and Jokić's of the world) have caused him trouble sometimes since he's light on his feet, though he's strong enough to hold his own. He's vulnerable to stepback jumpshots as well - they can fairly successfully create space against him.

1284,289,Is CP3 massively Underrated all time?,"Was looking at the ESPN all time ranks and saw Paul at number 40. But what stands out to me the most are some of the PG they have above him:

Jason Kidd (35) Isaiah (31) Nash (30) Stockton (28)

Now to see all time greatness I think you have to combine longevity with Peak.

Longevity: Including this season Paul has been in the NBA for 15 years of those seasons I think 14 have been at a very high level (not as a rookie although he was still quite solid. Kidd played much longer but the time where he’s numbers where comparable (still worse) were from 98-2004 so much shorter. Isaiah played 13 years and his last year was not great but even counting that it’s shorter than Paul. Nash first good season was 2000 and his last was 10 so again shorter than Paul, Stockton probably has the only argument on longevity Playing from 84-03 but his first good year was 87 and his stats fall off after 97. 

So all around Paul has already been at a top level longer than the rest and is still playing.

At his peak Paul was statistically superior than any of the other guys. Nash First MVP season might be better but Paul is also a far better defender. And the best defensive player of them all.",nbadiscussion
1285,290,Lifelong Jazz Fan thoughts on Gobert/Mitchell,"I attended my first Jazz game when the roster did not include either Stockton or Malone in the early 80's - I missed seeing Pistol Pete Maravich by a couple of years. 

I was at both the flu game and the push off game. Those are an odd combo of good/bad memories. 

* Here are my take(s) on Gobert/Mitchell:

* Utah is not normally part of any national media attention - so for this to be a story getting national attention is rare.  As such Jazz fans aren't always used to what degree national media will sensationalize, over hype, and honestly - misreport stories. I think The Athletic's and other reporting is accurate in the sense that it is based on actual quotes from both named and unnamed sources - but inaccurate in the sense that it is grossly overstated to fill the void.

* That said - Gobert has a maturity problem - and I do think Mitchell's frustration may go beyond the COVID-19 issue. Gobert's defense and overall effort has slipped this season and Gobert has been on record that he wants the ball more on offense which is a total joke given that Gobert has zero offensive skill outside of either a rebound putback dunk or catching an easy wide open pick and roll pass or lob for a dunk. If Gobert had even a modicum of post move ability or an 8-10 foot jump shot he would go from borderline all-star defensive gimmick to borderline MVP candidate. 

* Based on Gobert's video yesterday - I think that he and Mitchell will work things out. I also think that the national - if not worldwide embarrassment of Gobert touching all the microphones and the stories coming out about him kissing Mitchell and his immature actions even in the face of the Jazz head coach calling special team meetings in February and early March to discuss the seriousness of COVID-19 will mean that Gobert will have an increased level of maturity and seriousness when the team is able to return to practice and play.

* However - I think the Jazz are going to have a ceiling - low to mid 50 wins - perennial 3/4 seed - no salary cap room giving Gobert and Mitchell max deals. Mitchell looks to be more of a high volume/low efficiency Carmelo Anthony type player than he does an MVP candidate leader of a championship contender Dwayne Wade type player.

* As a lifelong Jazz fan I would love to be wrong about this - but that is my take for what it's worth (not much I know - but what else is there to do right now?)",nbadiscussion

My initial reaction is that Memphis FO is killing it. Got a first to absorb Iggy then traded him for a great(if injured) young player. I'm really excited to watch Memphis' end of the season. Hopefully Winslow will come back and be another ball handler and is built like a truck. Ja and JJJ are already a great foundation.

I honestly don't think this moves the needle for Miami at all. Iggy hasn't been good during the regular season in like 3 years, he wasn't even good last playoffs. I understand that he is more than his box scores, but the dude is declining and hasn't played basketball in almost a year. Maybe a miami fan can fill me in a bit. I guess I understand the extension, if he plays well they pick it up, if not they have a big expiring to trade.",nbadiscussion

1289,294,"Houston, We Have a Problem (I suck at titles sorry)","**This post is a long read (about 7mins), but there's a TLDR at the bottom.** I just wanted to share my thoughts about the D'Antoni Harden Rockets Era. Thanks for reading!

After Houston’s second straight conference semifinals elimination and its third in four years, it’s clear that something just isn’t working for the Rockets.  

On Sunday afternoon, per Adrian Wojnarowski, coach Mike D’Antoni signaled his departure from the franchise after an unforeseen yet anticlimactic four years as head coach of the Rockets. 

Thanks to GM Daryl Morey’s analytics driven philosophy, the Rockets constructed teams that completely tipped the scales of basketball, experimenting with lesser known playstyles and placing them at the forefront of their offense.

As the league began its three-point paradigm shift, the Rockets led the pack, attempting more threes than any other team over D’Antoni’s four year tenure. The Rockets “no midrange or bust” system reached never before seen extremes, with this season being no exception. This year, Morey planted the seeds of his “no big men” approach, which took small ball to another level. Houston traded away Clint Capela, opting for P.J. Tucker to play the five at a modest 6'5"".

And for the most part, it worked.

D’Antoni’s Rockets, led by prolific scorer James Harden, went 217–102 in four seasons— the winningest record in the NBA during his tenure. Houston made the playoffs all four years and reached the top of the conference in the 2017–18 season with a league leading 65–17 record. They even racked up numerous individual accolades, as D’Antoni and Eric Gordon were voted in as Coach of the Year and Sixth Man of the Year respectively in 2017, Morey recognized as the league’s top executive in 2018, and James Harden had bagged 2018 MVP honors to go with his three consecutive scoring titles in the past three seasons.

Yet, despite all this hardware, the Rockets now enter another offseason without acquiring the most elusive accolade of them all: the Larry O’Brien trophy.

In actuality, it would be unfair to not give any credit to the Rockets. Trapped in the shadows of the Golden State Warriors, the Rockets continued to stay competitive in an era where many other teams simply chose to wait out the Warriors dynasty. In fact, the Rockets pushed the Warriors to a seven game battle in 2018, with many believing at the time that if it weren’t for Chris Paul’s Game 5 hamstring injury, the Rockets would’ve advanced to the finals. Nevertheless, Houston missed an NBA record 27 straight threes in Game 7 and was promptly eliminated, the notorious statistic now synonymous with the team. 

Houston continued to stay competitive in ensuing years, as they reached the top of their division in 2019 and 2020. Still, a division title or not, the Rockets were eliminated in the conference semifinals in both years. Now, without a single finals appearance to their name the past decade and with D’Antoni’s exit, it has to be asked: **has the Rockets title window effectively closed?**

The Lakers gentleman sweep of the Rockets on Sunday was the latest reminder of this question. After taking the first game, the Rockets were quickly projected as favorites to win the series, with [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-nba-predictions/)’s statistical driven forecast giving them a generous 26% chance to emerge as NBA champions — the highest odds in the Western Conference. Yet, in a tale of statistical irony, the Lakers promptly won four straight, leaving the projections and analytics in the dust.

As telling as the numbers were, it still would’ve been naive to give the Rockets a fair chance to win the series. Let’s take a look at when and how the Rockets effectively lost the season.

Just as how Rockets have lived by the three on the offensive end, they make sure to shut it down on the defensive side as well. In conjunction with their small-ball philosophy, the Rockets maximize their defensive utility by employing a switch-everything scheme, a strategy instated by former assistant coach Jeff Bzdelik, who was fired last year. 

One of the downsides of a switch-heavy defense is that it is largely ineffective against great isolation players and when there are significant mismatches. In this play, the Lakers abuse both facets, using a handoff to switch Danuel House onto Anthony Davis who easily nets the turnaround jumper despite the double team. No matter how versatile a defender may be, it’s extremely difficult to make up for the height advantage that players like Davis possess. As expected, it allowed Davis to feast throughout the series, as he shot a blistering 66% from the field.

[AD Dominating Houston Defence](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/BoldBelatedAttwatersprairiechicken-mobile.mp4)

Despite this, defensive success still usually comes to teams that employ this defensive strategy. What those teams lack in size, they often make up in effort. However, this was far from the case for the Rockets in this round:

[Westbrook being Westbrook](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/AfraidEdibleBlueandgoldmackaw-mobile.mp4) 

Here, Westbrook tries to do too much on the offensive end and causes an unforced turnover. Instead of hustling back to stop the fast break, he’s late to pick up Markieff Morris and is lucky that his teammates have stopped Alex Caruso from pushing the ball. However, for some reason, Westbrook inexcusably lets Morris cut to the basket for an easy dunk off a dime from LeBron James. While Westbrook may have been recovering from injury, effort shouldn’t be something that needs to be healed.

On the offensive end, the Rockets continued to struggle. In order to neutralize James Harden, the Lakers doubled him on almost every opportunity, taking away his effectiveness on the perimeter and in turn, forcing him to pass out to his less competent teammates.

[Rockets forced to create out of Harden double team](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/IllfatedClosedAxisdeer-mobile.mp4) 

On some occasions, Harden is able to anticipate the double team and the Rockets are able to have actual movement with the ball. Unfortunately, Gordon misses the three and due to the Rockets' lack of defensive effort, they give up a touchdown pass from LeBron to AD with an and-one.

The signs of the Rockets defeat were always there. Their lack of offensive diversity was in the name of their game: the Rockets ran isolation plays a league leading 20% of the time (the next closest team were the Trail Blazers at only 9.6%). Their frequency of pick and roll plays were just 9.8%**!!** and 4.3% for the ball handler and roll man, respectively — both last in the league.

It’s no surprise that the Rockets offense breaks down once Harden doesn’t have the ball. His teammates are unable to create a shot on their own, and even the ones that can (looking at you, Westbrook), do so at an inefficient rate — he’s only generating 0.87 points per isolation, at an average 43.3% effective field goal percentage.

That’s not to say that the Rockets do not have an alternative game plan, but more so that D’Antoni has been reluctant to change the matchups that had dictated the series. As head coach, the onus is on D’Antoni to adjust his strategy instead of hammering the same ineffective plays over and over again. In all of the Rockets’ losses, Harden has been forced to pass out of doubles to roll men who just do not know what to do with the ball from there. You wouldn’t trust Robert Covington, P.J. Tucker, or even Jeff Green to handle the ball in open space, yet why does Mike D’Antoni make it his staple play? 

However, none of this absolves Harden of blame, either. Having run the franchise for the past eight years, Harden has been Houston’s leading points per game scorer. This season, he won the scoring title with an impressive 34.3 PPG. In addition, Harden was second in the league in fourth quarter points, only trailing Trae Young with 8.7 points per fourth quarter. However, in the playoffs, Harden is ranked 23rd in fourth quarter points with only 5.5. In game 4, he didn’t even attempt a single field goal. Harden has been disappearing in playoff games, and at this point, it’s a disappointing look for a player with his experience and resume, and troubling for the Rockets as he has three years left on his contract.

Now, even without D’Antoni in Houston’s future, the Rocket's problems aren’t yet over. In most cases, teams would opt to blow everything up, acquire draft picks and expiring contracts. However, with last year’s forced trade of Chris Paul for Russell Westbrook, their draft capital has been depleted, and instead of just two more years of a more effective CP3 (even with Harden’s chemistry issues with him), the Rockets are most likely stuck with one-dimensional Westbrook for three more years and $133 million on the books. In addition, the Rockets already have expiring contracts in P.J Tucker, Austin Rivers, and Ben McLemore, making the process of acquiring draft picks even more challenging.

Their ownership is tacky, with Tilman Fertitta starting to become notorious for his relative financial woes and reluctance to spend. Since acquiring the team in 2017, the Rockets have avoided the luxury tax, which came at the cost of not resigning Trevor Ariza, a pivotal piece in their conference finals series against the Warriors. They also managed to shed a significant portion of D’Antoni’s coaching team, including the aforementioned switch-everything defense wizard Jeff Bzdelik.

The future for Houston isn’t quite bright at this point. With no title in sight, it’s been a disappointing end to what could’ve been a rewarding four years. It’s a frustrating outcome that the Rockets now have to face.

**TLDR:**

\-Rockets experienced great individual and regular season success

\-Small ball only works if the team plays with effort, which the Rockets have only shown in spurts

\-James Harden is too important to the Rocket's offense. No one else can create a shot effectively besides him.

\-Houston Does not run any pick n'roll, which is the bread and butter of the rest of the league

\-James Harden falls short in clutch moments in the playoffs

\-They have little draft capital and other assets to shake up the roster. Russell Westbrook is most likely staying with Houston for the next 3 years

\-CP3 was a better fit with Harden than Russell Westbrook

\-Free agency is not really an option as ownership has money problems and is not willing to enter the luxury tax

1290,295,The media's blatant double standard for comparing eras,"It's been a long known fact that the media will only use an argument to suit their own narrative but recently this fact is only reinforced further. There has been a surge of media content following Kenny's Smith's controversial top 10 GOAT list (which is a repetitive topic that people seem to never find stale somehow), which was clearly biased as it had the likes of Nate Archibald making it. However, the main concern of this post is not regarding Kenny's list, but the media's response to it. 

The main outrage stems from the fact that Kenny placed Lebron at the 10th position. In typical fashion, media members like Shannon Sharpe and Colin Cowherd decided to share their opinion on the matter. The one shared opinion of both Shannon and Colin had was that Lebron is greater than the likes of Wilt, Bill Russell, Magic/Bird and so on is that the athletes Lebron face are better than those of the 60s/70s/80s. They believe that athletes are better than ever, with better facilities, better diet/nutrition and so forth. 

My main issue with this logic is regarding how we should compare eras. Media members can somehow compare players mano and mano while also whining about eras depending on the narrative they're pushing, but shouldn't we compare players depending on their success/strength relative to their competition. If Magic Johnson (for example) is playing athletes with worse conditions than the athletes of today, wouldn't it be fair that he had to endure similar conditions to his peers? It's not like the superstars of previous eras were eating steak dinners against players who were eating scraps and compost. That being said, there is truth to the sentiment that athletes are getting better. If that was indeed true, why is Kobe and Tim Duncan placed so much further behind Lebron, who both found greater success in a similar era of ""better athletes"".

I find it insanely hypocritical that the same media members (Shannon Sharpe, Colin Cowherd, Nick Wright etc), who place Lebron at number 2 would place Kobe outside their top 10 lists, or just barely making it, use the logic that Lebron played in a stronger modern era, but place the very era defining players so much further behind Lebron. If you truly believe that the modern era is a competitive era, then you should at least be consistent by placing Lebron, Kobe and Duncan all in the top 5. This goes to show that media members use a logical angle (e.g. strength of competition) and selectively apply it to suit their narratives and the players that have a bias towards (LBJ), but discards it when it comes to players that they regularly smear or overlook (Kobe/Duncan). Yes, Lebron generates a lot of clicks and attention, but using a viable angle of discussion and twisting to suit ones own agenda ruins the media's credibility to talk sensible basketball.

Edit: Some users in the comments seem to believe this is a GOAT/top 10 list debate between certain players, it is not. I just used specific players as examples.",nbadiscussion
1291,296,Who is the best player on the Memphis Grizzlies currently?,"The Grizzlies seem to be a very selfless team at the moment, with some great young players and some excellent role players. I'm not really sure who their best player is right now though.

Their scoring is fairly evenly distributed, led by Ja Morant (17.6 ppg, 57 TS%), Jaren Jackson Jr (16.9 ppg, 59 TS%), Dillon Brooks (15.7 ppg, 51 TS%), Jonas Valanciunas (14.9 ppg, 63 TS%) and Brandon Clarke (12 ppg, 67 TS%).

Most of the playmaking is done by Ja (6.9 apg, 5.3 assists per bad pass, 7.3 high value assists per 75 possessions), Tyus Jones (4.4apg, 8.9 assists per bad pass, 6.4 HVA/75) and De'Anthony Melton (3 apg, 4.4 assists per bad pass, 4.4 HVA/75).

Valanciunas is easily the best rebounder (11.2 rpg, +4.6 rebound percent when he is on vs off court).

Looking at defense, Melton (3 steal%), Jones (2.2%) and Kyle Anderson (1.9%) are best at getting steals, while Jaren (5 block%), Valanciunas (3.6%), Clarke (3.3%) and Anderson (2.3%) are good shot blockers. Luck adjusted defensive on/off net rating has Valanciunas (+3.4), Melton (+2.4) and Anderson (+2.2) as the best defenders, with Jaren as -1.4. Below are the median defensive values of several advanced stats ([RPM](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm), [RAPTOR](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-nba-player-ratings/), [EPM](https://dunksandthrees.com/epm#), [PIPM](https://www.bball-index.com/current-pipm/)):

1. Valanciunas (+1.5)
2. Melton (+1.5)
3. Anderson (+1.1)
4. Clarke (+0.5)
5. Brooks (0)
6. Jaren (-0.3)
7. Morant (-0.5)
8. Jones (-0.5)

Usage percent is led by Ja (26%), Brooks (25%), Jaren (24%) and Valanciunas (21%).

Morant leads the Grizzlies in clutch scoring (3.3 ppg, 60 TS%), followed by Clarke (1.4 ppg, 70 TS%), Jaren (1.3 ppg, 64 TS%) and Jones (1.1 ppg, 47 TS%).

Luck adjusted on/off net rating gives the following values: Melton (+7.8), Valanciunas (+2.2), Clarke (+1.5), Morant (+1), Brooks (+0.7), Jones (-0.3), Jaren (-1.3) and Anderson (-4.4).

I calculated the median of various advanced stats ([RPM](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm), [RAPTOR](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-nba-player-ratings/), [EPM](https://dunksandthrees.com/epm#), [BPM](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020_advanced.html#advanced_stats::bpm), [PIPM](https://www.bball-index.com/current-pipm/)), with the results below:

1. Valanciunas (+2.3)
2. Clarke (+1.5)
3. Melton (+1.1)
4. Morant (+0.3)
5. Jaren (+0.1)
6. Jones (-0.1)
7. Anderson (-0.6)
8. Brooks (-1.1)

I think you can make a good case for Valanciunas as the Grizzlies' best player based on his efficiency, rebounding, defense, net rating and advanced stats. Maybe Ja's amazing playmaking is being undervalued by net ratings and advanced stats, but it is likely that some of that value is being dragged down by his defence and reluctant shooting. However, playmaking is essential to a good team, so I do think he is slightly undervalued by some statistics. Jaren has been efficient, but it seems like fouling (5.2 fouls per 36 minutes, which is 7th in the NBA) is an issue for him. Melton and Clarke are clearly excellent low-usage players, excelling in defense and efficient scoring respectively.",nbadiscussion
1292,297,Most MVPS on One Roster - Quarantine Basketball Reference Findings,"In my continued adventures on [basketball-reference.com](https://basketball-reference.com/) I have tried to find the season for a team where they had the most future and former League MVPS. Only 4 teams in NBA history had 3 or more at one time and only one of these teams won the chip.

**Most MVPs on one team: 1985-1986 Philadelphia 76ers (4 MVPS)**

In his quest to play for virtually every team, the 1975 MVP, Bob McAdoo joined a Sixers team with young Charles Barkley, old Dr. J and Moses Malone. There is no other instance of 4 NBA MVPs being on the same roster. This team had all four players either in veteran or too young mode and fell in the Eastern Semis.

**Quest to get a Ring: 2003-2004 Los Angeles Lakers (3 MVPS)**

With Kobe Bryant and Shaq being the obvious 2 MVPS, this is simply a case of a veteran searching for a ring after years of despair. Karl Malone, well past his 2 time MVP seasons, as well as a veteran Gary Payton sought a ring in the end of their careers. The infamous 04 Pistons were victorious in the Finals in the last game of the legendary Shaq/Kobe era.

**What could have been: 2009-2012 OKC Thunder (3 MVPS)**

This one is no surprise, and is possibly the most tragic as they were together in the their infancy differing from the surrounding teams with veteran MVPS. James Harden, Kevin Durant, and Russell Westbrook were together for three seasons, with their final game together a finals loss to the LBJ Heat.

**Champions: 1981-1985 Los Angeles Lakers (3 MVPS)**

In the most successful of the listed teams. Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bob McAdoo won 2 Titles in 4 trips to the finals together. Although 6 years removed from his award, McAdoo was still vital to these legendary 80s Lakers teams. Jamaal Wilkes and James Worthy were further HOFers also on this team.

I feel like this shows how most MVPS are distributed to a few teams and only recently have MVPS moved teams often so I foresee there to be more teams in the future with 3 or more. With the Durant, Westbrook, Curry, Giannis and Harden era of MVPS, it's the most variation over a stretch then ever before.",nbadiscussion

Before the start of the 2003-04 season, the Minnesota Timberwolves were preparing to face the music. Their star power forward was entering his peak and having to run a one-man show. 7 play-off appearances had been met with 7 first-round exits. Progress of the franchise had reached a stand-still.


The 2003 play-offs brought a land of opportunity. The wicked witch of the west in the Los Angeles Lakers were dead—or so we thought. The Spurs had provided further evidence that a team could be led through their big man with balance in their guard play — even though Tim Duncan was a center and not a power forward, but got listed as a power forward so everyone thought, ""Damn, power forwards are useful."" But more importantly, the west was wide open. 


Kevin McHale and a newly promoted Rob Babcock would proceed to make the moves to build around Kevin Garnett in the best way possible — a valuable backcourt. 


Sam Cassell would leave the big three in Milwaukee to create a new big three in Minnesota, where his talents as a seasoned lead guard would be appreciated by the team and the NBA media as he would be voted to the All-NBA Second Team and voted into the 2004 NBA All-Star Game for the first and only time of his career.


The term swingman could be used to describe many aspects of Latrell Sprewell—his style of play, his personality. A man whose antics made Gilbert Arenas look like a saint would complete the highest scoring trio of that year—meshing well with this co-stars even if only for the year.


Key role-player additions — Fred Hoiberg, Michael Olowokandi, Trenton Hassell — would round out a roster, providing key role-player minutes and versatility.


McHale had done everything right. 


Flip Saunders had a lot of assets to work with and needed to create an offensive system that would highlight the individual talent while also producing team chemistry and limiting solo performances.


His take on an isolation game was the perfect fit — allowing for Sam Cassell to run the offense, Kevin Garnett to space the floor while also getting offensive looks wherever and whenever. The floor spacing wouldn’t create looks around the perimeter for the team — who would have the 5th lowest amount of three point attempts. Instead, it would create drive opportunities, isolation on the wing and more importantly, good looks at the basket. The Wolves would had their shots blocked the least amount of teams in the NBA that year, 6th in assists and would have the 2nd best field goal percentage.


In reality, the focus of the team’s powers would come of the defensive end. Garnett at the four allowed for flexibility as a defender — being able to move around the floor without much limitation. Meanwhile, the Timberwolves guards would be feisty defenders, disrupting the offensive flow. The Wolves would rank 2nd in forced turnovers, 7th in blocks and a solid 3rd in total rebounds. Teams would only shoot 41% against them and more importantly, every miss felt like a disaster — as the Wolves could sprint down the floor right into an offensive scenario of their liking.


Despite the slow start, as the team was a completely re-modeled, the team deserved to be the best in the west and Kevin Garnett deserved the recognition as the most valuable player. He was a walking double-double that always produced a threat of being a walking triple-double with his passing—even if he only managed to produce 2 triple-doubles. He would not have a game with less than 10 points, he would have 12 30+ points games, he was simply incredible that year.


When the play-offs came around, there was still skepticism. Their history of early exits were tough to swallow. But, they would luck out with how the cards fell. They have to go through a first-year stud in Carmelo Anthony and more than likely face the dangerous Sacramento Kings. But being able to avoid San Antonio and Los Angeles for 2 rounds was important — it gave them hope. 

--

Playing against Denver felt like playing against the unknown. The team hadn’t made the plays since 1995 and Carmelo Anthony existed. Even if he would be screwed out of the rookie of the year award to LeBron James, he was the most intimidating rookie that year. But a team that lived by their one player was going to die by their one player.


Game 1 would feature a clinic being put on. Sam Cassell’s 40 points—16 of 24 from the field and 5 of 6 from deep. Garnett would try his best to out-duel his teammate with a mere 30 points, 20 rebounds while also managing to rack up 5 fouls and only play 36 minutes. 


Denver felt lost as their rookie simply couldn’t produce enough. 19 points, 6 of 17 from the field and fouling out wasn’t the entrance Anthony would have liked to make. He wasn't in Syracuse anymore, this wasn't March Madness where everyone would be experiencing nerves. Then again, he was going against what felt like the best team in the association.


Minnesota would continue the trend of scoring points and the Nuggets not being able to score a lot of points in game 2. Carmelo would struggle again—which meant this team would in-turn struggle. Despite Voshon Lenard having a heat-check start to the game—15 points, 6 of 9 shooting in the first, Denver would be held to 9 points in the second quarter.


And instead of Cassell lighting up the scoreboard, this would it would be Sprewell finding his stroke—going 11 of 17 from the field and 7 of 8 from deep. KG’s triple double, Wally Szczerbiak’s 11 points were enough to get the team to a confidence boosting 2-0 series lead and it truly felt like the team was ready to sweep.


But game 3 would produce some nerves. Bringing a play-off environment to Denver for the first time in  a while would have the crowd in full force and the altitude in Denver produced a sluggish start for the Wolves, that would be taken advantage of. Carmelo’s 10 in the first was impressive but the 1 of 4 and 1of 6 start from Sprewell and Cassell were signs of the offensive tempo the Wolves were so used to be disrupted. The Nuggets only missing 7 shots meant a slower game for the Wolves on the offensive end, meaning a lot more effort having to be exerted. 


Turnovers and mental lapses from the Timberwolves gave the Nuggets faithful something to cheer about it would be known this type of game couldn’t be replicated. You simply wouldn’t out rebound the Wolves every night.


Game 4 would be a banger. Both teams felt that it was must win—Denver had to win for morale support, Minnesota didn’t want to have to return to Denver or even having the chance of needing to win in Denver again.  


It was an ugly game until the final moments. Carmelo Anthony would not make a basket in the first half and would not record a point in the first half. Voshon’s hot first quarter would be met by a scoreless second. On the other half of the court, 3 fouls and 4 turnovers from Sam Cassell was not the first half start Saunders wanted from his point guard. Kevin Garnett would have a respectable 13 points and Latrell would have a solid 8 points but the Nuggets would battle to keep it a tied game at the half.


When the Nuggets would start the third quarter with a small line-up, it seemed like the right move— as they had an 11-2 run in the second. They were killing the Timberwolves with their points off turnovers statistics and every attempt to slow the game down would be met by either a poor shot or a questionable offensive foul call.


However, the Timberwolves would rebound. Uplifting possessions from the Nuggets — such as a Marcus Camby pump-fake and dunk onto Kevin Garnett—would be met by silencer jump-shot. Melo would score his first two points of the game but his teammates would step-up in his absence. Birdman—who had a solid first half—wouldn’t make an appearance in the third quarter and Kevin Garnett would find his game. His 6 free throw attempts, Trenton Hassell’s perfect 5 for 5 gave the Timberwolves a much needed lead going into the fourth.


Carmelo Anthony would only play 5 minutes inthe fourth quarter. After missing his 3 attempts, he would be pulled to create the small line-up that the Nuggets felt would be the answer to their problems. Voshon Lenard would continue to do his best to keep the Nuggets in the game but the small line-up of the Nuggets would be met by an even bigger line-up from the Timberwolves. 


With 1:27 to go, Lenard would drill a three-pointer off of a pump fake. to make it a one-point lead as Melo would be shown cheering on his team from the bench. The crowd was into but off of a timeout, Latrell Sprewell would be alone in the corner to quiet the crowd.

52.9 seconds to go, Lenard would match-up with Garnett on the perimeter but the ‘Big Ticket’ would punch the ball out of the sky, leading to an unfortunate empty possession of the Nuggets. 


Sam Cassell would bring the ball up and immediately post-up Earl Boykins on the left side of the floor.. As the shot-clock would wind down, his spin into a fadeaway jumper would not go in and instead, a sprinting Nene would slam home the quick two with 18.7 seconds left to go, making a 2-point game. 


Boykins would do his best to flop a foul but instead, he would put Latreel Sprewell at the line with 12.1 seconds to go. Sprewell hadn’t seen the line that night and the camera would turn to Carmelo Anthony, who would not enter the game. The 81% regular season free throw shooter would miss both attempts, as Sam Cassell couldn’t believe what he had witnessed, hands on his knees at the half-court line.


4.8 seconds to go, Andre Miller would get stuck near the circle but manage to get off an attempt that would somehow fall into the hands of Lenard, somehow avoiding Kevin Garnett’s clutches. Tough defense from the big men of Minnesota meant Nuggets fans were not going home with a happy ending. Garnett would launch the ball across the court in celebration and you would have thought they had just won game 7. 


Kevin Garnett was brutally honest in the post-game interview, saying “We’re playing like crap and we’re beating them” was the truth. They were playing like crap. But, they were still winning. Also, [shoutout to Kevin Garrnet’s mom](https://youtu.be/DrN529TeCxY?t=5634). 


Game 5 felt over before it even started. Carmelo Anthony did not dress for the game. Back home, the Timberwolves would dominate, breaking the streak of their first round exits. They would not have to return the Denver.


While they would prefer to play against Dallas, the Timberwolves would have to face a team that was looking to fight for their stay as one of the West’s best teams. It would instead feel like the end of one era and the start of a new one.


The match-up was intriguing as both teams had offensive flexibility, range and size. On the defensive end, the liability of Mike Bibby would mean Sam Cassell would be able to do all he wanted but it was known Bibby would attempt to fire back on the offensive end of the court. But the two wouldn’t be as impactful as the match-ups in the 2 and the 4—two swingmen and two power forward greats. 


This series is truly known for two games — game 3 and Game 7. The rest don’t matter as much, we kind of have to get through them.


The team that had lived off of the three point shot would struggle from deep in game 1 against the Timberwolves. However, an uncharacteristic performance from Kevin Garnett and Latrell Sprewell meant the Kings had stolen game 1. Bibby and Cassell would go for 33 and 40 points respectively in their offensive duel but we wouldn’t see the same battle for the rest of the series. 


A team that would score the second most points in the NBA would be held to 12 points in a quarter during game 2. The Timberwolves would find success with Garnett, Sprewell and Hassell scoring all 17 points for the team in the first quarter. A balanced team effort from Minnesota would be complemented by the King’s inability to make the ball fall into the basket and even with the Kings making a run-back into the game in the third, the Timberwolves would fight off Stojakovic and Webber’s attempts—with a 16 to 1 run to end the game, tying the series at 1-1.


Game 3 is where the fun begins. 


We start in the third. A tight first half would transition into a disaster situation as Bibby and Peja couldn’t get a basket in the third quarter. Hassell’s 10, Sprewell’s 8, KG’s 5 and relatively clean sheet from Cassell gave the Timberwolves a much needed 10 point lead going into the fourth. 


With 1:47 to go, some Kings fans would begin to exit their seats to avoid traffic. An 11-point lead from the Timberwolves seemed insurmountable, with the streaky shooting of the Kings and the defensive ability of the Wolves. Sam Cassell’s foul trouble had kept him out for most of the game but you knew he would be coming in to finish the deal.


*I mean, there’s no way they screw this up.*


Hassell would try left baseline but his kickout attempt to Sprewell would be intercepted by Peja, and Bibby would drill a transition three. 


100-92, Wolves. 


Immediately fouling Kevin Garnett, he goes 1 for 2.


101-92, Wolves. Timeout. 


The in-bounds play would be quick—get the ball into Bibby’s hands, try to make Cassell foul out. It worked. Doug Christie’s post-up and wrap around lead to contact in the paint and Cassell was out of the game. Ball didn’t lie as Christie would miss his first but hit the second.  


101-93. 


The Timberwolves would be able to drain the clock even further. But Sprewell’s attempt to get the ball to KG would get picked off by Peja. Fast break. Bibby would get the ball and with a defender in his face, would drain another three with 59 seconds to go.


101-96.

Sprewell would run it up the court and nearly turned it over, letting out a smirk as he got up—as if he was realizing what was about to happen.


Kevin Garnett would take his turn, attempting to seal the game but instead missed a jumper from the elbow. 37.3 seconds left and the Kings had the chance to make it a one possession game. Christie pulled the ball from the clouds and it was the perfect transition opportunity. Peja would be out ahead, Bibby and Webber would quickly follow creating a 4-on-2 fast break.


Not even thinking about a two, Christie kicked it to Peja and Sprewell would attempt to limit the damage by falling into Peja. 


And he still hit the three. The blank faces of the Timberwolves, Flip Saunders looking like he saw a ghost and Kings fans couldn’t believe it. Peja would miss the free-throw, the ball would fall out of bounds after a scuffle and the Timberwolves could let out a sigh of relief for a moment.

101-99, 30.2 seconds left, Timberwolves ball. 


Darrick Martin would look like a fish out of water attempting to bring the ball up would still manage to draw a foul. *Could he be the one to secure the win for the Timberwolves?* No. It wouldn’t be a good story. He would go 1 for 2, Kings secure the rebound.


102-99, 24.8 seconds left.


The Timberwolves would set-up to eliminate the three. They would execute that portion of the defense to perfection but instead, leave Chris Webber in a mismatch in the paint and he would be able to execute a beautiful hook shot over the smaller defender. 

102-101, 17.8 seconds left. 


Darrick Martin would be the man to go to the line once again. This time he would not miss. 


104-101, 17.2 second left. 


*No threes, no threes.* 


The Kings would immediately put the ball into play and Bibby would be a man on a mission. He would run to the right side of the court where Peja stood and they would execute the simple 'hand-off, screen, shoot.' The Timberwolves backcourt weren’t able to fight through the screens or trap and Peja had the look of a lifetime. Bottom of the net, swish.

104-104, 10.7 seconds left. 


The only play the Timberwolves could run would be through Garnett. If possible, he could kick it out but you knew Garnett would be the first person to touch the ball. He would from the low post to the top of the arch and be guarded by Brad Miller. Losing his footing and the help defense that would come from Peja and Webber meant KG couldn’t get a good look at the basket. 


We had overtime. 


When the Kings won the jump and Peja would score the first two points of overtime, it felt like the game was over. *Did the Timberwolves just collapse? Did they choke?*


And then there was the re-jump. 

Brad Miller and Kevin Garnett would fight for the rebound and we would have the jump for possession. Brad Miller would commit a violation and the Timberwolves had the ball again. It was a weird moment in the game — the crowd had quieted down. The reckless, craziness of the crowd instead returned to a normal play-off crowd. It was a different atmosphere. 


It would get worse.


A Mike Bibby foul with 2:34 put the Timberwolves at the line and he would be out with his sixth foul. But instead of walking with grace, he would throw his headband into the crowd and a stunned Rick Adelman could only act as a peacemaker for the man who may have just changed the game by committing a technical foul.


It wouldn’t matter - Hoiberg missed the free throw but the Timberwolves now had a two point lead. But still, stupid f***ing mistake, Bibby. 


Stojakovic would be the only Kings’ player to record a point in overtime. His three-point shot after countless offensive boards gave the Kings a 1 point with 1:45. The Wolves and Peja would trade buckets back-and-forth but the Wolves would have the ball with 31.5 while they were the ones holding a one point lead.


Acting point guard Kevin Garnett would set up the offense and you could tell a power forward was setting up the offense by how crazy it looked. Hand-offs around the perimeter somehow created a match-up of Christie on Garnett at the foul line. And with 1 second left on the shot-clock, Garnett somehow got up a shot that would bounce in with 10.8 left in the game.


It was MVP sh**. 


Flip Saunders and a Florida retirement community resident-looking Kevin McHale would immediately signal to foul rather than let the Kings get another look at a three-point shot. Peja would hit both.


6.1 seconds left, 114-113, Timberwolves. 


Garnett would get the ball on the inbounds but would trip. Trapped near his bench, the tower would fall and the refs would signal traveling. You couldn’t make it up. 


With 4.1 seconds left, the Kings would have two opportunities to draw up a play. The first, would fail to create anything and a timeout would be called to re-grouped. 


The second time, a high screen from Brad Miller would leave Peja free at the top of the arch. But the inbounds pass from Doug Christie would lead Peja out towards half court, meaning he now had to dribble as the Timberwolves now had time to react. His attempt to draw a foul would not work and the Timberwolves weren’t done yet.


Games 4, 5 and 6 weren’t as fun. 


Game 4 would be a great game from Chris Webber. Game 5 would be a great game from Latrell Sprewell. Game 6 would just be a great performance from the Kings—because you couldn’t end an era on your home court. 


Game 7 was set. 


The winner of the series would have to prepare to face a Shaq and Kobe team that looked to somewhat be back in form, taking the series 4-2 against the Spurs. Then again, if Derek Fisher doesn’t hit a miracle buzzer beater in game 5, the story might have been different.


The plot was simple — would Sam Cassell stop slumping? Is Kevin Garnett having a moment? Are the Kings still kings? 


We received another instant classic. 


Kevin Garnett and Sam Cassell would start the game hot — scoring 18 of the team’s 22 first quarter points. Sprewell’s 0 for 5 from the field balanced out the team struggles that the Kings were facing. The second quarter would again feature shooting woes—this time KG, Cassell and Peja would not hit a shot from the field. KG would also have a ridiculous catch-block—even if his solid defense wasn’t leading to good offense. Sprewell would put together 5 points but would also draw his third foul and the Timberwolves were desperate for a spark plug.


And then Wally Szczerbiak stepped on the court. His scrappy, role-player minutes combined with his impressive jaw-line had fans falling in love with him. Despite not being the prospect he originally once was, he was an asset to the team off the bench as both a scorer and defender. 


 His 12 points in the game 6 lost wouldn’t be a thought in the minds of most but rested in the minds of the Timberwolves coaching staff. Because in the second quarter of that game, he would go 4 for 6 from the field, put up 10 points and have a heat-check moment of a lifetime. There would just be random, Lin-sanity type moments where he would just dribble around the floor and somehow manage to get off a shot an drill it. It was beautiful. 


The Timberwolves had managed to keep the Kings under 20-points each quarter but their ability to runaway with a lead never happened. And when the third quarter came, the Kings would look to crush the souls of the Minnesota faithful. Doug Christie would be perfect in the third from the field but it would be a team effort from the Kings to close the gap, Sprewell and Cassell would look to put the team on their backs but turnovers would give free points away. 


Webber and Stojakovic would pick the worst times to go cold in the fourth. Kevin Garnett would pick the perfect time to show he was the best player in basketball that year. But the low scoring affair would keep things interesting. 


With 1:03 to go, 79-75 Minnesota, Mike Bibby would wrap around a screen and drive to the basket. Creating what felt like an easy look for Chris Webber — who had been struggling that night — wouldn’t pay any dividends as Webber would scream for a foul call on the contested finish at the basket. 


A possibly injured Sam Cassell would bring the ball up and stand near half-court to draw out the clock. But Doug Christie’s dive for the ball would get his team the ball back, add another foul to the Timberwolves’ tally and more importantly, create an empty possession for the Timberwolves. 


After trading free throws, the score would be 81-77 Timberwolves as Mike Bibby would receive the outlet pass on a missed free throw. He would kick it out to Christie, who would make sure his feet were behind the line, and drill the three point shot with 17 seconds to go. 


81-80, Timberwolves. 


The Kings would quickly foul Sam Cassell and put him to the line. Despite the possible injury, he would hit both free throws, put this team up 3 with 16.2 seconds to go.


You would expect Peja to be your go-to but his rough shooting night—3 of 12— meant he probably wasn’t the best option. Being able to focus on perimeter defense was a huge advantage for the Timberwolves—even with the deep threats. 


[Christie would inbounds the ball to Bibby](https://youtu.be/kLbTODPNXbA?t=1046)—who would now be alone in the corner. A failed high screen from Chris Webber meant Bibby now had to face the wraith of Kevin Garnett and more time would be wasted attempting to get Garnett off of Bibby by the Kings. Swinging it out to Christie gave the Kings a good look but the shot would not fall but Kevin Garnett not being in the low-post meant the Kings had the opportunity to get the offensive rebound. 


Miller would secure the rebound but KG wouldn’t kept away from the low post any longer and would swat away the two-point attempt. 


2.5 seconds to go. 


The Kings had a decent spot out of bounds. Brad Miller and Peja at the top of the arch was a decoy — the play was always going to Chris Webber. Garnett would attempt to pick off the floating pass but his long arms couldn’t reach. Instead, it left Webber wide open. 


The ball would loop out and Weber would collapse to the floor. Sprewell, Wally and KG would embrace, the Kings players couldn’t believe it and Kevin Garnett would leave the floor on his birthday a happy man.


Now — Sam Cassell.


The most under-discussed, under appreciated storyline in all of basketball history is the Sam Cassell ‘Big Balls Dance.’ A dance that would feature a bow-legged Sam Cassell galloping down the court, attempting to show fans his huge nut sack would create a lot controversy. You won’t find it in NBA highlight reels — even though Kobe Bryant would re-create it years later. The NBA completely hates it. 


But its so memorable because of its presumed effect on the 2004 play-offs. 


In the Game 7 match-up, after drilling a jumper, Cassell would run down the court, completing his dance. I tried it myself at home, it hurts a little bit. But according to Flip Saunders, it lead to an avulsion hip fracture that would limit Cassell’s appearance in the western conference finals. He would play 31 minutes in game 1, less than a minute in game 2, 27 minutes in game 3, 5 minutes in game 4 and that would be the last time we would see Sam Cassell in 2004. Sam Cassell had issues in the post-season with a re-occuring back issue. But this hip issue, this was interesting, it made sense with minor changes in his mannerisms.


The lack of Sam Cassell at full strength would cost the Timberwolves the series and their shot at the title. This wasn’t a situation like last year when Klay Thompson just added to the reasons why the Golden State Warriors lost and wasn’t the key component to the loss— the Timberwolves likely would have made it past the Lakers and had prior history of playing well against this Pistons line-up.


Phil, Kobe and Shaq smelled blood. 


The lack of Cassell removed a critical offensive threat and offensive leadership. It allowed for Kevin Garnett to play a flexible game and go unpunished. Now, the aging Karl Malone would have help when guarding KG. Defensively, the Timberwolves could hang in the series. Shaq would still be an unstoppable force but could be maintained by the various big men of the T-Wolves and a helping KG. It would lead to Karl Malone have a better series but if you were beat by the Karl Malone as the third man of any team, you would be understanding. 


Damn it, Cassell.


If he plays healthy, here is what (probably) happens:

(a) Rick Fox and Luke Walton see the floor more as Karl Malone is no long on the receiving end of defensive leniency from the Timberwolves. Malone would suck for most of the series but would still get a lot of free buckets.

(b) Gary Payton takes more minutes from Derek Fisher. 

(c) Kevin Garnett likely doesn’t get guarded as tight.

(d) Sprewell gets a lot more off-ball opportunities and just plays better.

(e) The pace of the game goes up from mid-to-high 80s to low 90s. 

(f) The series becomes a more physical, high action match-up.

(g) We get one interesting soundbite out of Shaq.

(h) We get at least 7 games or a Timberwolves victory.

(i) We still probably get a Sam Cassell 'Big Balls Dance.' 


If Phil Jackson says they probably lose the series of Cassell is healthy, I believe him. But, let’s also look at the games.


At the start of game 1, you would have thought Cassell's impact would be fine. His 3 of 5 shooting, 4 assists was a great start to the game. The Timberwolves would test old man Karl Malone with his confidence, allowing him to go 2 for 6 from the field but would struggle to find the right way to guard Shaq. Michael Olowokandi would be out muscled on the defensive end but would still get a respectable 8 points back, going 4 for 5 from the field. 


As the game progressed, the gambles would fall into the favor of the Lakers. Cassell would see less playing time, meaning Hoiberg and Wally would have to lead the offense — which they couldn’t do. Karl Malone would go from starting 0 for 4 to hitting his next four shots and suddenly, you couldn’t help as much on Shaq. 


Cassell would do his best to fight through the pain but his 1 for 5 performance in the third quarter would provide more harm than help.  Malone, Bryant, O’Neal and Fisher would dominate the third quarter on the offensive end and the half-time adjustments were completely one sided. Despite a poor first game from Kobe, you wouldn’t have realized it. 


Game 2 already became a must-win and must-win, they did. The bench guards of Wally and Darrick Martin would combine for 31 points—we don’t talk about how they went a combined 10 of 27 from the field. Garnett would not be stopped, putting up 24 points on 10 of 20 from the field. The bench of the Lakers wouldn’t provide the assistance you would need with slumping starters and their 71 points would be their second lowest points the team produced in the play-offs. 


That would not happen again in the series. 


Cassell would attempt to return in game 3 but again, he was a liability. He would be outmatched by Gary Payton and Payton would pop off. Wally Szczerbiak would do his best as a replacement, but his inability to lead an offense still clouded his 21 points. Garnett and Sprewell’s slow first half was taken advantage of by the Lakers — who produced a lead that could not be overcome from, despite the duo returning to form in the second.


Game 4 would continue to trend of an offensive disaster from the Timberwolves as Garnett and Sprewell would struggle to buy a bucket in the first half—going 9 for 26 from the field. The low scoring affair felt like a good sign — as Karl Malone and Kobe Bryant would struggle to find rhythm but Derek Fisher splitting time with Gary Payton meant he could find his own rhythm—5 for 7, 10 points. 


Bryant would finally make his appearance in the series with an 18 point third quarter, making up for Karl Malone’s 1 of 6 shooting in the same time. KG was unable to match the offensive firepower and the Lakers 15 point lead after three would carry the Lakers to a game 4 victory.


You cannot end an era on your home court so in game 5, we would get one last fight. It would not start in the first quarter but a tone would be sent. Garnett would take 7 shots — hit 2, Sprewell would put up 5 attempts and hit 2. The duo would not lose this game and they would be the ones to determine the fate of the team in the play-offs.


Second quarter — 4 for 7 from Garnett, 5 for 8 from Sprewell. 

Third quarter— 4 for 6 from Garnett plus four free throw appearances and makes, which was a nice change for Garnett after not seeing the line as much as you would like. Sprewell also had a made basket but the bench mob Hoiberg and Wally would be the impactful guards of the quarter.


The fourth quarter, things would get spicy down the stretch as the Lakers would go from 85 points to 96 points within 30.9 seconds but the lead created by the Timberwolves lead would not be touched—thanks to Sprewell, Garnett and Wally’s efforts at the line in the fourth. 


The Timberwolves would not be sent home on their home court but game 6 would be daunting. Draped in the signature blue uniforms, you would have thought the Timberwolves were attending their funeral after the first quarter. Kobe would explode for 10 points in the first quarter, Shaq would have 8 and more importantly, Garnett would draw two early fouls and only manage to produce 1 point off of a technical foul free throw. Trenton Hassell — who still existed— would try to re-emerge in the first but his 2 for 6 performance did not help. 


Quarter number two, Kobe and KG would trade narratives as Kobe would draw 2 quick fouls, only playing 3 minutes, and would produce 0 points. Garnett would put the team on his back, avoiding picking up another foul and get a solid 9 points up on the board for the team. But the real story was Shaq somehow managing to rack up 4 fouls in a quarter, an incredibly feat, as a sign of frustration with the Timberwolves’ ‘hack-a-Shaq’ strategy.  He would see the foul line 9 minutes and only manage  to put 2 of them in and Oliver Miller’s 4 second quarter fouls had paid off. 


With Kobe back in the game, the Timberwolves couldn’t get away with their treatment of the Lakers’ big man and he would return to his regularly schedule program of dominating fools with 10 3rd quarter points. But Kobe, Malone and Payton having 2 makes on 14 attempts meant the Lakers would still fall behind the Timberwolves. The starters of the Wolves managed to produce 22 points but the 3 point lead did not feel like enough, especially with Sprewell slowly struggling with this 3 of 8 performance. 


The fourth quarter would become desperation from the Timberwolves. The game would become incredibly physical and messy. As a result, 11 fouls and 7 turnovers  would be committed by Minnesota. The Wolves were killing the Lakers on second chance points though, then again the Lakers didn’t need second chances. 


The depressing result was that the talent on the Timberwolves wasn’t enough to win the series, despite it being an incredibly winnable series The dumb things that the Lakers would do — Derek Fisher trying to throw an alley-ooo to Karl Malone, Karl Malone just being trash, Kobe not having an incredible series — didn’t matter because the Timberwolves didn’t have their point guard. 


The game would wind down, as the Lakers had produced more than enough to secure their return to the finals. Kareem Rush’s career high 6-for-7 from deep—including 3 makes in the fourth quarter lone— were daggers every time they fell. 


Kevin Garnett would do his best to hide his emotions, Flip Saunders would stand on the sideline appearing like a concerned guidance counselor at your local high school. Attempting to hide his emotions, he would ignore the side huge from Saunders, avoid the high-fives and simply sit down in his chair and contemplate life. 


*You don’t end an era on your home court.* 


The off-season would be a painful one. Sprewell would notoriously retire after turning down a contract extension, meaning the Timberwolves would lose one of their big three and arguably take a setback in performance. Instead of putting the blame onto the lack of improvement from a managerial perspective, McHale would put the blame onto Saunders and fire him mid-season, replacing Saunders with himself. Sam Cassell would be traded, McHale would fire himself as a coach and it would set course for Kevin Garnett wanting out.


There would be a happy ending for two of the individuals involved -- Cassell and Kevin would find success with other franchises. But 2004 result would quietly drive a narrative that wasn't real. The Lakers weren't the best team in the west that year -- so their loss to the the Pistons in the finals wasn't as surprising. If the Lakers exit in the WCF, Kobe is likely picked as the weaker link -- as he arguably didn't perform as well as Shaq, despite the freedom he had against the Timberwolves backcourt. 


If the Timberwolves make it to the finals, they probably win. The regular season history favored the Timberwolves and they would be coming off beating the team that had terrorized them in previous first rounds, as well as having much needed rest. We probably see the Pistons try to run it back the following season, Cassell's lack of health issues probably means the Timberwolves would give Sprewell the contract he wanted, in attempt to run it back. McHale looks like a genius, Garnett might not go to the Celtics. 


Damn it Sam, what could have been.",nbadiscussion

1300,305,The difficulty of ranking Kawhi Leonard's career in a historic manner,"Kawhi's career to be blunt has been unlike any modern NBA superstar's career we've seen. He was a good player his first 4 seasons of his career, but didn't take off on the scoring side of the game until his 5th season. Even late superstar bloomers like Giannis and Steph have the MVPs that Kawhi doesn't. 

His current accolades are: 

4x All Star

2x DPOY

2x FMVP

3x All NBA

5x All Defensive Team

2x Top 3 MVP finish (2nd in 2015-16, 3rd in 2016-17)

1x ASG MVP

I'd say he's around the top 30 right now, but his lack of points on the all time scoring list and the health concerns might make his top 20 and above case hard to achieve.

Where do you see him ranking in a range A) right now and B) when his career is done, if he plays 6-8 more years at around 60 games a year?",nbadiscussion
1301,306,Reminder: Joel Embiid is under contract for 3 more years after this season,"All the Embiid-for-[insert second/third string players] trades have already started to pour in from wishful fans. This is a reminder that Embiid is:

* only 26 and squarely in his prime
* arguably the best two-way C in this league
* the foundational block for this 76ers team that would've beaten the eventual champs Raptors if it weren't for Kawhii and the bounce
* under contract for three more seasons after this

Please consider all the points above before posting your ridiculous Embiid trade. imo it would have to take a AD/PG13-level ridiculous offer for the 76ers to even consider trading him. I just don't see it happening, regardless of how they do this post-season. 

I think the Embiid-Simmons core is just too young and too good to give up this early on, they stay together for atleast two more seasons after this.",nbadiscussion

But before 2015, GS was a mediocre franchise outside the Run TMC era, maybe Rick Barry teams, and had the 2012-2014 teams. You look at the Pacers or Blazers and people trash them for not tanking, being mediocre, but they make the playoffs every year. I just feel they deserve respect as good basketball franchises. Maybe they should've tanked but it is there way and for my opinion the more honorable way to win. In the current era where tanking is so glorified now I respect these franchises a lot because of their ability to continue a winning culture.",nbadiscussion
1303,308,The Small-Market Spotlight for January 2020 - shining a light on the more ignored teams in the NBA,"[Small-Market Spotlight for December 2019](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/e534fi/oc_the_smallmarket_spotlight_for_december_2019/)

So as a break from the constant chatter about the Lakers, Rockets, Clippers, Luka, Raptors, Celtics and Sixers: here's a brief report on the 23 other teams that /r/nba tends to ignore. I’ve gone into every team subreddit in search of three things that might seem interesting/surprising to a non-fan.

This is mainly a surface level reading of what's going on though, so I hope that other fans will come in and correct me if I'm super offbase or elaborate on the things that I've chosen to summarise.

*Bucks and Jazz fans protested about being ignored in the last thread so I’m experimenting with being over-inclusive this month.

--------------------------------------------------

#THE EASTERN CONFERENCE

**Magic**

- Current record: 16-20 and 8th in the Eastern Conference.

- Orlando Magic are 6-9 in their last 15 games with Vucevic putting up 20/10 with 2 stocks. Their fans REALLY enjoyed the wins against the Heat and the Sixers. As of today, they are 2 games ahead of 9th placed Charlotte and seem well-placed to make the playoffs again this season. 

- Except injury woes have struck with their entire wing rotation currently being out. The worst, of course, being Johnathan Isaac who was making a push for All-Defence being injured for two months. Gordon, Okeke and Aminu just make it worse for Magic fans.

- For those curious about Mo Bamba: “He’s raw af, decent shot blocker, better than expected 3pt shooter. He’s probably 3 years away from starting for this team. He shows the signs — but like many young players, he’s yet to do it consistently. He’s improved compared to where he was from the start of the season though.”

**Pacers**

- Current record: 22-14 and 6th in the Eastern Conference.

- Pacers have beaten Philly, Lakers, Celtics, Toronto and Jazz this season and could finish with a home seed this season. Why are they so good? “imagine having to face a 7 footer who bullies the fuck out of people in the paint and is top 5 in the league in rebounds, while also having to face a 7 footer who shoots the 3 at 38% and averages over 2.0 blocks a game. not to mention the former ROY and MIP in the same starting lineup with one of the most underrated scorers in the league (TJ Warren).”

- Recent WojBomb:’ Pacers All-Star Victor Oladipo hopeful for a late January/early February return from ruptured quad tendon’

- There is a growing worry that Indiana won’t have any All-Star representation in the upcoming All-Star game. Sabonis is behind Hayward, Blake and Vince in fan voting while Brogdon didn’t even make the top 10. Tacko Fall has double the votes of Sabonis and /r/pacers is willing to riot if he ends up a starter.

**Hornets:**

- Current record: 15-23 and 8th in the Eastern Conference.

- Terry Rozier is 1 year older than Kendrick Nunn, producing the same numbers as Fred Vanvleet and Jamal Murray on the same pay as Jeff Teague and Reggie Jackson. /r/hornets is dividing on Scary Terry with some saying that he is empty stats and others saying that he is better than expected.

- PJ Washington has returned from injury and has continued his nice form. In his last 5 games, he is averaging 15.6 points, 5.2 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 9 of 17 from 3-point range in that time. Some believe he’s been a top 5 rookie this year.

- /r/hornets has been discussing realistic trade targets. While most seem to want 1st round picks to help shore up their young squad, others mentioned names like Poetl, Dunn and Beasley as guys who fit in with what they’re trying to do.

**Pistons:**

- Current record: 13-23 and 11th in the Eastern Conference.

- While are sad about Drummond leaving, most are excited about the idea of a full rebuild where they’ll finally be moving in the right direction. Hawks are the frontrunners but new reports say that Portland and Charlotte might be interested. If any decent offers come in for Blake and Rose, fans seem comfortable with losing them too.

- Did you know Detroit had a young core? Me neither. Their names are Sekou Doumbouya, Bruce Brown, Christian Wood, Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk and Luke Kennard. Most will already know Kennard but Sekou is a 19yo rookie who’s started to see serious minutes. He has a double double in his last two games and /r/DetroitPistons are getting excited.

- The Lions, Tigers and Red Wings are still all below .500 too so life is still pretty rough right now for Detroits sports fans.

**Cavs:**

- Current record: 10-25 and 13th in the Eastern Conference.

- Kevin Love is throwing major tantrums right now but what does Cleveland fans think? Reactions are mixed but my favourite comment is this one: “120 mil for getting carried by LeBron, and he still not happy”. This story is already in the limelight so not much to add here.

- 2nd year Collin Sexton is currently in the firing line. Hes upped his PPG, RPG, FG% all while playing less minutes than last year so far. But he needs to get back to shooting 3s efficiently because hes had a major decline from behind the arc. He was at 40% from 3 last year but has only made 27% of his 3s this year. Some find his tunnel vision infuriating while others argue that he’s a scapegoat for a weak roster and terrible FO. For those who are curious, Sexton putting up 18/2 on a rookie contract. To compare, Jamal Murray is putting up 18/5 on $33m a year.

- Cavs have 14 games left in January with only 4 of them being .500 teams. Considering 90% of their wins have come against other teams with a losing record, don’t be surprised if the Cavs go on a winning streak sometime soon.

**Bucks:**

- Current record: 32-5 and 1st in the Eastern Conference.

- Acting like the team with the best record in the NBA and the reigning MVP is ignored is silly so I’ll just highlight some non-Giannis content to appease the Bucks fans. Here’s [a pic from Eric Bledsoe’s birthday party](https://i.imgur.com/A5Yl8DQ.jpg). 

- Everyone knows Giannis dominates inside the paint but [Middleton has everywhere else absolutely covered](https://i.imgur.com/Pdno20h.jpg)

- Bucks have the best record and that’s not going to change this month. The only .500 teams they face this month are Boston and Denver but the big event for Milwaukee is their game against the Hornets in Paris. Due to the travel probably. This will be their only game between the 20th and the 28th of the month.

**Nets:**

- Current record: 16-18 and 7th in the Eastern Conference.

- Yes, Kyrie and  is injured but quick summary of the rest of the squad. Levert has just returned from injury and played 15 minutes yesterday. David Nwaba is loved and missed.. Taurean Prince is ass. Theo Pinson is ass. Kenny Atkinson may or may not be ass.

- The Nets All-Decade team is Dinwiddie/D-Lo/Johnson/Thad Young/Brook which I found interesting. How well do you reckon that team would do in today’s Eastern Conference? Maybe they get a first-round upset.

- The Nets have the biggest active losing streak in the NBA. They’ve lost their last 5 with three of them coming against Houston, Toronto and Dallas, one being an OT loss to Minnesota and a loss to local rival, the Knicks. The schedule for the rest of the month is pretty tough with games coming up against Utah, Miami, 2x Philly, Milwaukee, and Lakers. If they slip up against any of the teams below .500, don’t be surprised if they drop out of the playoff spots.

**Bulls:**

- Current record: 13-23 and 10th in the Eastern Conference.

- The average age of Chicago’s 8 man rotation yesterday was 23.75 years old. “ Kris Dunn, Thad Young and Satoransky are just stop gap players. The real core is Coby, Lavine, Markkannen, WCJ and Gafford”. Also, Daniel Gafford may prove to be the steal of the 2019 draft as he leads his draft class with 1.22 blocks per game while only averaging 11 minutes.

- After a poor start to the season, Markkannen’s form is finally picking up. In December, Lauri Markkannen averaged 17.6/6.1/1.4 in 65% TS. Some are frustrated that he only gets 12 shots a game while others believe that his terrible chemistry with Lavine is why he hasn’t taken a leap yet. Still, there’s little reason to lose faith and he seems due for a couple big performances.

- The Bulls have the 4th best defence in the NBA. To quote their sub, “We're 14th in the NBA in netrtg at -0.4.This means that we have the best netrtg of any team below .500. And simultaneously have a better netrtg than both the 7th and the 8th seed in the East. We’re the best shit team in the NBA.”


**Wizards:**

- Current record: 11-24 and 12th in the Eastern Conference.

- There doesn’t seem to be a lot going on in the Wizards sub. Bertans good. Rui injured. Beal beal. Everyone seems to accept that they’re redshirting right now but are ‘ happy with the direction for next year of Wall/Beal/Troy/Rui/Thomas Bryant + our lottery pick + Bertans/Ish/Admiral/Wagner/McRae bench’.

- [John Wall is practicing full contact 1v1 and is nearing a return soon.](https://streamable.com/c8m3d)

- Can’t find any other interesting things on the subreddit so let me just remind everyone that Bertans is shooting 43% on 8.6 3s a game.

**Knicks:**

- Current record: 10-25 and 14th in the Eastern Conference.

- “Mike Miller is 6-6 in his first 12 games as Knicks head coach, David Fizdale was there for 104 games and he never had a 12 game stretch as good”. After 12 games, it seems like all the things that Knicks fans thought was dumb about Fizdale was actually dumb. Using Randle and Portis as ball handlers, trying to make Kevin Knox a 2, throwing out random DNPs for no reason. Miller’s sorted all of that out and the Knicks record has improved.

- The mood is improving on /r/nyknicks. Their vets like Morris/Randle/Elfrid are being utilized properly, their young core of RJ/Frank/Knox/Mitch seem to be in good hands and their offseason targets of Zion, Kyrie and KD were a lot riskier than they first anticipated.

- Knicks next 11 games are fucking tough. In order, Clippers, Lakers, Jazz, resurgent Pelicans, Heat, Bucks, healthy Suns, Philadelphia, Cavs, Lakers, Raptors. If the Knicks can go through this stretch without being blown out by 30 once, then it’ll be a huge impovement.

**Hawks:**

- Current record: 8-28 and 15th in the Eastern Conference.

- All season, Hawks fans have been shouting about their team desperately needs a backup ballhandler because their offence straight-up dies when Trae is off the floor. Enter 2nd year Brandon Goodwin. In the last 3 games, Goodwin has averaged 12/3/3 in 76% TS. And the Hawks record in those games? Ws over the Pacers and the Magic and a last second L to the Celtics. 7 of the Hawks next 13 games are against .500 teams, so don’t expect them to be a run together just yet.

- Advanced stats no longer say that Trae Young is the worst defender in the NBA. That title now belongs to Bradley Beal who now lies at the bottom of DRPM and DRAPTOR. In fact, DRAPTOR has Trae currently as a better defender than Fox, Kennard, D’Lo, Booker, Derozan and IT as well. Please update your circlejerks accordingly.

- Quick summary of everything else. John Collins is back. Huerter is hitting good form. Hunter looks promising. Jury’s still out on Reddish. Reaction is mixed on Drummond.

------------------------------------------------------

#THE WESTERN CONFERENCE

**Thunder**

- Current record: 20-15 and 7th in the Western Conference.

- People are generally aware of how well CP3 is doing on the court, but what he’s doing off the court is going under the radar. Just from glancing at the sub, he’s bought the entire roster custom suits, is gifting floor tickets to random families, being a clear mentor for SGA and is paying for the team to go watch NFL games. Naturally, /r/okc loves this fucking guy.

- A month ago, 6 of OKC’s 8 wins come against Golden State and the Pelicans and people weren’t sure about how good they are. Now they are 9-1 in their last 10 games with notable wins over Toronto, Dallas and the Clippers. They are 2 games behind Luka and have a month where more than half of their games are against teams lower than .500. It’s not ridiculous to think that this team could finish in the top 6. 

- Though, naturally that’s only going to happen if they keep CP3, Adams, Schroder and Gallinari around. General feeling from OKC fans is that they want to ride this fun season out, make the playoffs and then accumulate more picks in the summer. Also, everyone (including me) would love to see a Rockets/OKC first round series.

**Nuggets**

- Current record: 24-11 and 2nd in the Western Conference.

- After a 3 game losing streak that culminated in a disappointing loss to Philadelphia, Denver Nuggets then went on a 10-3 streak where they racked up Ws over Lakers and Pacers. In that run, Jokic finally hit form and averaged 22/9/7,  Michael Porter Jr started his first ever game and got 25pts in 23 minutes and Gary Harris continued his All-Defence campaign.

- It’s only a minority but some people are growing concerned that Jamal Murray hasn’t taken a leap. He’s signed a max extension and his numbers have gome from 17/4 in his sophomore year to 18/5 on average efficiency in 2020. The Nuggets are still winning with him and he’s shown to be a good fit with Jokic but some fans believe their team’s ceiling is capped unless Murray becomes a biggger contributor.

- There’s a lot of Jokic content on their subreddit so here are some stray Jokic facts: Jokic is tied with Bob Cousy for 10th most triple doubles ever, he’s passed Melo to become 9th in Denver assists and BR ranked him the 35th best player of the 2010s.

**Grizzlies**

- Current record: 14-22 and 11th in the Western Conference.

- We are approaching the All-Star Break and the Grizzlies are 1 game away from the 8th seed. Do they trade Valanciunas to try and secure a lottery pick? Or do they skip this draft and aim to become the youngest playoff team in history? It’s a good problem to have and fans seem fine with either option.

- RECYCLE: They’re a contender for the most promising young core in the league. Ja, JJJ, Clarke, Anderson, Caboclo, Brooks are all 24 and under, with 27 year-old JV serving as the elder statesman. Apart from JJJ’s inability to stay out of foul trouble, there are no serious concerns.

- RECYCLE: Fans don’t seem confident about nabbing anyone in free agency or via trades. Their 2020 pick is top-6 protected and the top priority seems to be a wing that will complement Ja and JJJ.

**Jazz**

- Current record: 23-12 and 5th in the Western Conference.

- Clippers, Mavericks and the Nuggets all lose and now Utah Jazz are one game away from being the 2nd seed in the West. After a torrid run, where they went 6-2 in December, Jazz have gone 10-1 in their last 11 games with their only .500 win in that stretch coming over the Clippers. Their next 7 games are all against teams below .500 so expect this run to continue.

- Coincidentally Mike Conley has missed 13 of their last 14 games via injury. Mitchell has stepped in as PG and he looks good. Mitchell is putting up 27/6 in the Jazz’s last 5 games and the Jazz have 5 Ws. Though their schedule recently has been soft, would they have won all those games with Conley too? /r/UtahJazz thinks they definitely would have and aren’t willing to entertain discussion of trading Conley yet. 

- So far, fans are loving the Clarkson/Exum trade and they’re seeing the bench improvement already. Georges Niang is starting to get buckets. Joe Ingles has been balling out. Gobert might threepeat the DPOY. Jazz fans are having a good time right now.

**Trailblazers**

- Current record: 15-21 and 8th in the Western Conference.

- /r/trailblazers is ANNOYED that people don’t understand just how injured they are. “Portland are missing 3 starters, two of which were key defensive pieces in Collins and Nurkic, Hood who was an extremely efficient scoring option that could create his own shot, as well as now the backup center in Skal who gave valuable minutes when Hassan sat.”

- Even though they’re 8th, there’s no passion for a playoff push due to their current injuries. Nurkic and Collins aren’t expected back so several fans would rather miss out entirely than be 1st round fodder for the Lakers.

- Their sub has a massive trade thread. Summary, Love is bad because of huge contract and injury prone.Love is good because he’s a good fit and a hometown guy. Some say they shouldn’t trade but instead should get healthy and reassess. Aaron Gordon’s name also came up multiple times.

**Spurs**

- Current record: 14-20 and 9th in the Western Conference.

- Spurs were the 8th seed 5 days ago and the hunger to keep up their playoffs streak is real. Ideal scenario is a first round war against the Clippers. In terms of prospect, the subreddit is kinda low on Dejounte Murray and very high on Lonnie Walker IV. They’re desperate for him to get more minutes and think they’ve got someone potentially special on their hands. Also, it might be time for Derrick White to return to the starting five.

- In his last 7 games, Derozan is averaging 25.7pts on a nice 69% TS. Contract talks are happening soon and /r/nbaspurs are open to resigning him as long as it’s nowhere near the max. Also, there doesn’t seem to be much interesting in trading Aldridge either. They’d like to trade Forbes and Belinelli too but feel like their stock is currently low so they won’t get any value in return.

- On the Spurs’ recent decline, someone commented “I think we greatly underestimated how much losing FO people & our assistants over the years would hurt us & I think it's starting to take it's toll. Guys like Bud definitely had a great impact on our offense & losing guys like Sean Marks has hurt our FO cause they're definitely not the same either.

**Suns**

- Current record: 14-21 and 10th in the Western Conference.

- Deandre Ayton’s favourite player is Kevin Garnett and what has Monty Williams decided to do? Play Ayton at the 4. Sort of. To put it simply, on offense Baynes is 4, Ayton 5 but on defense they switch. The lineup reportedly looked good against the Knicks but fans’ only issue is who’s gonna be the bigman in the second unit. Hopefully Check Diallo can hold it down until Kaminsky comes back from injury.

-  2nd year Mikal Bridges is a minor unsung hero of Phoenix. ‘He has the highest net ratg of any player on their team and has legit All-Defence potential and will probably be underpaid for the entirety of his career due to lack of splashiness’. Fans think he doesn’t play enough minutes but he seems like a big part of the Sun’s future.  

- After an 8-game losing streak, the Suns are now 3-1 in their last four with 2 wins coming against 8th seed rivals, Sacramento and Portland. In that run, Ayton has played great defence, Oubre Jr is averaging 26/8/3 and Booker is averaging 33/8/4. 6 of their next opponents are below .500 so we’ll start to have a sense of how good this Suns team really is.

**Timberwolves**

- Current record: 13-21 and 12th in the Western Conference.

- “The #Twolves are not moving KAT anytime soon. Stories like this create discussion, and selfishly, are good for business, whether for radio or TV. But just know that Wolves folks would tell you that KAT more than anything wants to win here. Year 1 of 5 offers time.” Trading for D’Lo discussions have started up again but having 3 max contracts of D’Lo, Wiggins and Towns isn’t going to scare anyone in the playoffs, so it seems like they’d have to get rid of Wiggins somehow too. 

- It seems that the Embiid beef, trade rumours and being a 7 foot Steph Curry has done wonders for his popularity this season. From being behind an injured Boogie in All-Star voting last year, Towns is now 5th behind Lebron, AD, Kawhi and PG despite his team’s losing record.

- After an 11 game losing streak, The Timberwolves find themselves 1 game out from the 8th seed. They are 3-2 in their last 5 with  goddamn, it’s close at the bottom of the West! - with them on a current 3-2 with 8 of their next 13 games coming against .500 teams. Do Timberwolves fans dare to believe they can make the 8th seed? No. Most of them have no faith at all.

**Kings**

- Current record: 12-24 and 13th in the Western Conference.

- Of all the teams battling for the 8th seed, the Kings subreddit is the angriest. They’ve soured on Buddy Hield, they’re shitting on their FO, they’re pining for Boogie, Shump and Joerger, they want Luke fired now. It is bad. And they’re only two games out from the 8th seed! 

- But why are Kings fans so angry? Because they’re 1-9 in their last 10 and fans believe they could be pushing for the 4th/5th seed if certain things were different. 4 of those losses came against Pacers, Rockets, Nuggets, Clippers while another 4 losses came against 8th seed rivals, Grizzlies, Suns, Timberwolves, Pelicans. Of their next 12, 6 are against .500 teams and another two are huge games against Suns and Timberwolves. January is a huge month for them.

- Who does Kings trade for to get better? No-one. Common sentiment seems to be ‘Just hold steady and get a good draft pick and hope the young guys start developing.” 

**Pelicans**

- Current record: 12-24 and 14th in the Western Conference.

- The New Orleans Pelicans can still make the playoffs. “An amazing 14 of their final 15 games are against teams with losing records, nine of them are at home, and the one winning team (Philadelphia, which visits April 11) may end up sitting players to rest for the playoffs. For those of you tracking such things this early, the Pels will also own the tie-break with Portland if they win either of the teams’ final two meetings.” They have currently won 6 of their last 8 games. Derrick Favors has returned and is balling out. The fans (and the media) would love a first round series against the Lakers.

- What about Zion? Isn’t he redshirting? Not according to /r/NOLApelicans. That’s a dumb narrative people are selling to get clicks. Reports say that the team is just being extra conservative with their #1 pick and they expect him to debut this year. General sentiment is that “If he’s injury prone, then he’s injury prone. Sitting healthy players does not benefit the player. Zion will only get better at basketball if he plays. He will only get in true NBA basketball shape, if he plays basketball. Sitting an extra 30 games this season isn’t going to extend his longevity.”

- Lonzo ‘is a bust’ Ball is averaging 25/8 in his last three games on 65% TS. What do Pelicans’ fans attribute such a crazy turnaround to? The introduction of Favors helps but also, “Lonzo has been saying that he feels healthier than ever, and these last few games his bounce has been WAY more noticeable as he's been dunking it more often - he had an insane tip dunk in the blazers game. So the reason for his lack of aggressiveness issues might have been also related to health - he's looked way more athletic these past few games. His 3 has been falling much more, he has been driving more - more aggressive overall and PATIENT - he's also looked more athletic, that in summary makes the current lonzo current.”",nbadiscussion
1304,309,Is Playoff DeRozan the most negatively impactful star in NBA history?,"Nothing against the guy, and I do think he's a solid regular season player. This is strictly about the playoffs. 

&nbsp;

He's had the worst individual plus-minus on his team in 4 of his last 5 playoff runs. For the past six postseasons, his team has performed better without him. ""Trash Bros"" was the prevailing narrative after all those years of Raptors playoff failures, but Kyle Lowry always had the much better plus-minus. And this last postseason was the most damning. With DeMar finally gone, Kyle Lowry managed to post the highest plus-minus of all playoff players (a whopping +161).  Kawhi was +157 but none of the other Raptors were even in the hundreds. In contrast, DeMar joined one of the best organizations of all time, coached by one of the best coaches of all time, and yet again posted the lowest plus-minus out of anyone on his new team.

&nbsp;

Plus-minus doesn't tell the whole story, but it's difficult to dismiss 6 years worth of data. And his plus-minus isn't just ""bad""--it's all-time bad. He consistently finishes in the bottom 5-10% of all eligible playoff players. It has to be exceptionally rare for a playoff team to consistently perform better without one of its stars, let alone without their supposed best player(which he was regarded as with the Raptors). And it's difficult to fault his teammates when he alone consistently ranks near the bottom of the league every postseason.   I added Kyle Lowry's plus-minus totals for comparison,

&nbsp;

1305,310,/r/nba 2015 flashback: ‘Who is going to be the better player in 5 years?',"Link: https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3goo39/lets_play_whos_is_going_to_be_the_better_player/?limit=500

--------------------------

As a 2015 thread asking who will be the better player in 2020, I thought it’s about time to revisit this thread. Let’s see who people thought would be the better player in 2020, and actually discuss who the better player is now.

This post from the 2015 offseason said:

> Basically list two young players and people will respond with who they think will be better in 5 years.

The format for this thread will contain a context section so you can get a sense of what was going on at the time the OP was posted. 

Afterwards, I’ll highlight certain comparisons that I thought were interesting, post their 2015 counting stats to give an idea of what they were producing at at the time and quote some of the more articulate responses from the thread below.

----------------------------------

**Context for August 2015:**

Warriors won their first ring vs Lebron’s Cavs. Steph had an MVP. Kawhi won his first DPOY. Draymond was  DPOY-runner-up. Wiggins was ROY

Russ had won the scoring title but wasn’t a serious MVP candidate due to team record and missing too many games.

Durant and PG had missed a lot of time during the 2015 season due to injury.

AD was in his third season, Gobert and Noel were sophomores while Nurkic was a rookie.

Kyrie had just finished his first year playing with Lebron. Lillard and Aldridge got knocked out in the first round by Memphis.

2015 draft happened recently. The top 4 picks were KAT, Russell, Okafor and Porzingis.

#Comparisons

---------------------------------------

PG vs Kawhi

|Player|Age|G|TS%|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|PTS|
|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|
|Paul George|24|6|.492|3.7|1.0|0.8|0.2|8.8|
|Kawhi Leonard|23|64|.567|7.2|2.5|2.3|0.8|16.5|

Someone said:
>Before this past season I would have said George, but looking at the way Kawhi improved this past season, It's probably him now.

>Look, I know people want to say that George is a better and more complete offensive player, but you're not looking at the context of PG's breakout season. Vogel gave him and Stephenson almost complete control of the offense. Put Kawhi in the same role, and I suspect his contribution on offense would be similar.

>Look at Kawhi this past season. Pull up threes, turnaround jumpers, eurosteps, and a back-to-the-basket game. That's more than what I could say for PG. He's one of my favorite players, but his offense is literally straight line drives, pull-up jumpers, and transition buckets.

>It's hard to compare the two on defense because PG just missed a season, and a big part of defense is experience, and maybe PG might have been a better defender if he played. All I'll say is that Leonard is a DPOY while only playing 64 games, and PG was 7th place in his best defensive season.

And /u/sharksfanabroad said

>They're not that hard to compare; similar experience (Kawhi has 252 regular season games to PG's 292) and similar position.

>Kawhi has the better career TS% (.583 to PG's .545), but has benefited from the lower usage rate (18.3% to PG's 23.4%). Also, with Kawhi's increasing role, we're seeing a decline in his TS%; can't be as efficient when becoming more of an offensive focal point.

>The win shares are even, but WS/48 favors Kawhi. Despite some counting stats benefiting PG (since his offensive output is high; usage rate), the advanced stats suggest that Kawhi is better defensively while PG gets more assists.

> I guess my answer is ""don't bet against the Spurs"". They seem to know what they're doing with their talent; not exhausting them, and doing the best to prove that longevity as a top-tier player is better than a couple of seasons as a top-5 player.

-------------------------------------

AD vs KD

|Player|Age|G|TS%|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|PTS|
|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|
|Anthony Davis|21|68|.591|10.2|2.2|1.5|2.9|24.4|
|Kevin Durant|26|27|.633|6.6|4.1|0.9|0.9|25.4|

Someone said

>I think it will be AD. He is a better defender who can be a 28p/12r/4a/3b/2s guy and dominate the league with his inside and developing outside game. If he really adds the corner 3 or spotup 3 to his game I think he won’t be much worse on O but will be much better on D because he can guard 1-5 for a possession and has DPOY potential. Also he is the man everybody thinks LeBron will pass the torch to as being the best player in the league.

Another said

> Anthony Davis. Kevin Durant will be 32 and his athleticism will begin to decline, but still is a top 10, maybe top 5 player in the league. Davis will be the best player in the league (unless Wiggins is Kobe/Jordan 2.0, but we can't tell yet).

> Anthony Davis to me will become Karl Malone who's an even better defender... god damn. Hope he gets a point guard to feed him like Stock fed the Mailman. I will be very disappointed if I have to watch Davis get mid 2000s Kobe'd and have a shit team around him.

/u/ztejas rebutted that

> Durant is a generational talent and 32 is not that old. Especially for a 6'10"" player that is one of the best shooters in NBA history. Go look at any all-time-great's stats at 32. Jordan, Kobe, Bird, Hakeem, Magic, Malone. They were all still great and still top 5 players at 32. Some of them were the best player in the league. LeBron is going to be 31 next year, and he will still either be the best or 2nd best to KD. Davis is the only young gun that is probably a safe bet to be on the same level as Durant at some point in his career. Thinking that there will be 5 players that have surpassed KD in 5 years is pretty empty speculation.

-----------------------------------

Steph vs KD

|Player|Age|G|TS%|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|PTS|
|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|
|Stephen Curry|26|80|.638|4.3|7.7|2.0|0.2|23.8|
|Kevin Durant|26|27|.633|6.6|4.1|0.9|0.9|25.4|

This is the season after Steph’s 1st MVP but before his 2016 MVP. Below is a quickfire of different one-liners from that comment thread.

> Durant, younger (by a few months) and already better.

> KD’s not much younger, but still, KD's already the better player by far. Shit man, people really have forgotten about him

> Durant is the second best player in the NBA when he’s playing.

> Curry won't improve anymore aside from perhaps better assist stats.

> Curry. I don't think we've seen his final form yet.

----------------------------------

Steph vs Russ

|Player|Age|G|TS%|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|PTS|
|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|
|Stephen Curry|26|80|.638|4.3|7.7|2.0|0.2|23.8|
|Russell Westbrook|26|67|.536|7.3|8.6|2.1|0.2|28.1|

Someone said

>In 5 years they will both be 32 (Westbrook will actually be 31 and 10 months). Westbrook won't be nearly as athletic as he is now which his game relies heavily on. Steph is at an advantage there as he relies on his athleticism much, much less.

Another person said

>One player's game is meant for 32 years of age while the other's most definitely isn't. Lebron is the greatest athlete possibly ever in the NBA and even he looks like he lost a step this year. That's at 30, imagine two extra years on a player who isn't super durable like bron

And this person said.

-----------------------------------------

Kyrie vs Dame

|Player|Age|G|TS%|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|PTS|
|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|
|Kyrie Irving|22|75|.583|3.2|5.2|1.5|0.3|21.7|
|Damian Lillard|24|82|.460|4.6|6.2|1.2|0.3|21.0|

Someone said

> In 5 years, they'll both be #1 options, but Kyrie will have 5 years of running a top-5 offense under his belt alongside great support and probably the best mentor anyone in the league right now could ask for. If I had to invest in one player to cash in 5 years from now, it would definitely be Kyrie.

Another said

>Dame's two years older. He got to play with one of the best floor spacing bigs in Aldridge and had decent 3pt shooting on the wings.

>Kyrie played with verajo, Thompson, Bennett and Tyler zeller as his bigs. He had dion waiters, Alonzo gee, Jarrett jack and cj miles as his wings. There is not much shooting there, Bennett never developed, zeller just started hitting mid range in Boston, Andy was always hurt, jack had a terrible year, and well dion...

>Still they averaged similar ppg and FG %. Dames a good player, but Irving is just better. He has all the tools, sweet 3pt stroke, ability to score in the paint (he finishes near the top FG % inside 6 feet for PG's) and some say the best handles in the league. He has the size, 6'3, and the athleticism to become a good defensive player and showed improvement last year.

While /u/irelli replied to the above with

>Nope, Lillard definitely doesn't have a sweet 3pt stroke. No way he's led the league in deep 3s (30+ feet) since he came in the league.

>Lillard finished better from inside 5 feet this year than Kyrie did, and on a higher volume too. Lillard: 59.9 % / Kyrie: 56.7 %. Lillard is six three too. We have set plays that end in a Lillard alley oop so I’d say Lillards a bit more athletic. Anyway, Kyries real advantage is that he's a much better  ball handler and a more acrobatic finisher. I would just take all those other things over his handles.

----------------------------------

Gobert vs Nurkic

|Player|Age|G|MP|TS%|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|PTS|
|-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|
|Rudy Gobert|22|82|26.3|.627|9.5|1.3|0.8|2.3|8.4|
|Jusuf Nurkic|20|62|17.8|.484|6.2|0.8|0.8|1.1|6.9|
Someone said

> It's like comparing Vlade Divac to Ben Wallace. One's a solid two way starter, but the other can completely anchor your defense. Got to go with the guy who is elite at something rather than good at two things.

Another said

> Its Gobert. I will take elite defense, at an already young age, and still improving offense. Gobert is already maybe the best defensive center in the NBA, and he's still getting better. Nurkic is raw as hell, and could be a very good player, but give me Gobert 7 days a week, and twice on Sunday.

Finally, someone said

> Nurkic may be more skilled but IMO Gobert is more effective because of his athleticism and length. But sure, I'll concede the offense to Nurkic. However Gobert's effect on the D side is just so great that it destroys Nurkic's advantage on O. The Jazz went from no. 21 defence to top 3 after they traded Kanter.

-----------------------------

Gobert vs Noel

|Player|Age|G|TS%|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|PTS|
|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|
|Rudy Gobert|22|82|.627|9.5|1.3|0.8|2.3|8.4|
|Nerlens Noel|20|75|.493|8.1|1.7|1.8|1.9|9.9|

A lot of people commented on how close they found this comparison at the time.

Someone said

> This is the hardest one in here for me... Gobert's 9'9 standing reach is ridiculous and 7 inches higher than Noel's. Gobert has already proven that he can make a huge improvement from one year to another, which we have yet to see if Noel can. I think Noel has a higher ceiling but Gobert is more likely to be better of the two in 5 year

Another said

> Noel. I think he's a actually a better defender, he was top 10 in both bpg and spg. Also, while he has not shown much improvement on the offensive side, it is something that he has said he is working hard at. I think Gobert will just be a slightly better Tyson Chandler

/u/deknegt1990 replied to the above with

> Chandler was a DPOTY candidate in most of his years, player with phenomenal heart, grit, and determination.

>Remember that Chandler had the potential to be one of the best centers in the league barring DH, the only thing that derailed that was his injuries. Once he got to a team where he was healthy and happy, he was a beast. Mavs won a ring partly due to the ridiculous defensive load he carried.

> I'd love to see Gobert reach Chandler levels, minus the injuries he'll be a beast.

Someone mentioned that

> Numbers show that Gobert is the better defender. He allowed the lowest % at the rim as a starter and was third in blocks. He's faster, longer and now stronger than Noel. I have no doubt Noel with be the better Offense/Defensive combo

And finally someone said

> Noel because Gobert pretty much reached his ceiling already. He was the best rim protector and overall defensive terror last year, he cannot improve on that. On offense and perimeter defense he is who he is. All in all pretty good package but looking forward five years Noel might be better. He has the potential for much more versatility on both sides.

-------------------------

KAT vs Okafor

|Rk|Player|G|GS|MP|TS%|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|PTS|
|-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|

|2|Karl-Anthony Towns|346|346|34.4|.622|11.8|2.7|0.8|1.5|22.5|

Towns and Okafor were the 1st and 3rd pick in the 2015 draft and haven’t played an NBA game yet so I thought it’d be more interesting if I posted their career statlines above.

Someone said

> Towns. From watching them in college, I feel like KAT has more to grow. Something about Okafor just smells of ""he's at his potential"". I don't know why, maybe it's his stoic nature, but he just seems to be there already.

And another said

> Towns. I think he will be a great second peice to a championship team and can play a lot of ways.

>Okafor will be a player who gets 23ppg on a shitty team and cant be the go to guy on a 50 win team and has a playstyle that makes teams now want him

>I see him as Al Jefferson reincarnated

Draymond vs Ibaka

|Player|Age|G|GS|TS%|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|PTS|

|Serge Ibaka|25|64|64|.549|7.8|0.9|0.5|2.4|14.3|

Ibaka, who is only 7 months older than Draymond, was still a year away from getting drafted to the Magic for Dipo, Ilyasova and Sabonis. Draymond was a DPOY runner-up and had just won his first ring.

Here are some one liners.

> Anyone debating this just imagine Ibaka on the Warriors instead of Draymond. They are literally just as good and would likely be better.

> Ibaka is way better

> Ibaka is better right now than Dray could ever even hope to be

> Wait... So like an elite player or near elite player vs. a a guy that fits well in a championship team? Hmmmmm. Hard one

> Goddamn Dray is so overrated now

Someone replied to the above with

> Well one of them was a DPOY runner up and integral cog in a finals winning offense and the other didn't make the playoffs

Someone said

> Comparable defense yeah but Ibaka is nowhere near as useful offensively as Green. Ibaka is supposed to help carry the water for his team as a third option but I've seen many a Thunder game where he couldn't get that 20-10.

>Draymond on the other hand was actively engaged in one of the best offenses and defenses of last season.

> Ibaka is a better fit for the Thunder and Green is a better fit for the Warriors. Chemistry matters
Another poster said

>I'd take Draymond as a top-20 player in the league, and probably closer to top-15. I think his ability to defend centers and truly guard positions 2-5 makes him one of the most versatile and most useful players in the NBA. He completely changes your offense and defense and is the prototype for new the ideal NBA big. I think Ibaka is an excellent player, but Draymond's skillset is so much more rare that I'll take him any day of the week.

This marked his 7th straight appearance in a conference finals.

1308,313,Raptors rendered Mirotic unplayable.,"Haven’t seen this discussed with all the focus on Giannis and Kawhi.

Raptors in game 5 directed much of their offence directly at Mirotic as the weak link.  This rendered Mirotic literally unplayable in game 6 (he played zero minutes).

1309,314,How much would have Boozer helped LeBron if he stayed in Cleveland?,"Carlos Boozer was drafted in the second round of the 2002 draft by the Cavs. After a good rookie season which saw him make the All-Rookie Second Team, Boozer continued to improve in his second season averaging 16/11. The Cavs traded away future troublemaker Darius Miles and notorious ball hog Ricky Davis during the 03-04 season to clear out the space for a generation talent in LeBron James to take over the team. And it worked, the Cavs went from league worst 17 wins the season prior to a respectable 35 wins and nearly sneaking into the playoffs in the East. They had a young duo for the future in LeBron and Boozer. 


The Cavs decided to let Boozer become a restricted free agent after the 03-04 season, in exchange for him verbally agreeing to re-sign with them for a 39 million, 6 year deal (this is all according to Cavaliers owner Gordon Gund). Boozer became a restricted free agent and signed to a 6 year, 70 million deal with the Jazz, which the Cavs refused to match. Boozer denied that the verbal agreement ever happened. 


In the future, LeBron managed to carry an underwhelming Cavs team to the Finals in 2007 and spent his first Cleveland stint with his best teammates being Mo Williams and Zydrunas Ilgauskas. Meanwhile, Boozer averaged 19/11 across his 6 year stint in Utah, making the All-NBA Third Team once and the All-Star Game twice in the process.

Marc Gasol had a better DRTG, had more DWS, had a higher DPM, and had a higher BLK%. Gasol also averaged nearly double the amount of blocks than James did. Throw in the fact that Gasol's defense was amazing in the pick-&-roll and was great at switching onto smaller players. 

Gasol also helped propel Memphis to the #1 DRTG in the NBA and was the reason Memphis was both #1 in OPP PPG & #3 in OPP FG%. And this showed due to the fact that Memphis made the WCF.

Now Gasol *may* not have passed the eye-test as the league's best defender but both team & advanced statistics prove otherwise. Marc definitely deserved this award.",nbadiscussion
1312,317,Lebron 2016 game 7,"So I decided to start watching some throwback games during quarantine today. My first game is the 2016 game 7 cavs 3-1 comeback because I was pretty young back then and didn’t know much about the NBA. So far I’m almost done with the first quarter and I noticed LeBron has been less aggressive. He is cutting to the basket a lot, but he is barely trying to score and is making a lot of bad passes that are leading to turnovers. I recommend some people to watch this game and I was wondering if there was any reason he wasn’t shooting as much at the rim. Thanks!",nbadiscussion
1313,318,To Lose A Legend,"As writers, it’s our job to piece together words in an effort to share our thoughts, convey a message, or tell a story. We strive to paint a vivid picture of the jumbled mess inside our heads. Words are our weapon, our medicine, and our passion. And yet for the entirety of the day Sunday, the words would not come. I glared at the headline on my TV for 6 straight hours. I repeated it in my head at least a hundred times. I collected my thoughts enough to say it out loud. No matter how I processed the words, others would not follow. No thoughts. No reactions. Numb.

I sat on that couch all day, immobilized by a combination of shock and confusion. The news networks repeatedly showed the footage of the wreckage, smoke billowing and helicopter parts strewn about the mountainside. The breaking news headline glaring me in the face. At this point, it’s probably burned permanently into my memory. And with all of this overwhelming evidence in front of me, it still didn’t seem real. I found myself staring at the smoke, half-expecting Kobe to emerge carrying every passenger safely on his back, clutching his daughter in his arms. Because for Kobe, that would have made more sense than what actually transpired. It’s Kobe. Kobe can’t die.

My brain keeps flashing back to the moment I first caught wind of the news. Hungover and wallowing away in self-pity on my couch, I hear my roommate yell out in shock, “NO WAY.” I smile. I lazily turn my head to see what could have possibly happened to elicit this amount of shock from my normally reserved roommate. He’s not smiling. His eyes are wide and I sense he’s a bit frantic. My brain loosely connects the dots for a semi-educated guess, “Celebrity death?” He responds with “Yes, and it’s someone you like a lot.” I’m no longer smiling. As he begins to turn his phone screen away from himself and towards me, I run through my most adored celebrities in my head. My brain assumes a drug overdose. Maybe a musician? Donald Glover? I didn’t even get the opportunity to panic at that thought. Because for the rest of the day, I didn’t really have any thoughts. I was frozen. I stared at the words on that screen and waited. Waited for someone, anyone to speak up and say it wasn’t real. It couldn’t be real. It’s Kobe. Kobe can’t die. He’s not done being Kobe.

For those that aren’t too familiar with Kobe’s career, you’re only a Google search away from reading of an accomplished career marred by controversy both on and off the court. His legacy is a complicated balance beam, with major career milestones weighing against a sometimes self-destructive desire to surpass greatness. Ironically, his unwavering desire to be perfect showed us all that he wasn’t. He made mistakes. As millions share grief at the passing of their idol, others feel that there are a number of reasons not to admire Kobe. Some people elect not to forgive him for his mistakes. That’s fair. But as humans, we are not binarily good or bad. As humans, we’re allowed to move on from mistakes, to correct them, and to try to be better than we were before. It does not mean we have to be forgiven. And I think Kobe knew that. He acknowledged his past, faced it, and tried to be better. Not for all of us, but for himself. For his wife. For his kids. It really felt like the second act of his life was somehow going to be even more special than the first, because it gave us the opportunity to see Kobe through so many different lenses. Kobe the actor. Kobe the producer. Kobe the analyst. And the one I was personally enjoying the most, Kobe the father.

I’ve struggled internally to grasp why this has been so hard to comprehend. I didn’t know Kobe personally, and he didn’t even know I existed. I’d never even seen him in real life. Horrible things happen everyday. But when someone who seems to transcend life has it taken away from them in an instant, it’s jarring. It just doesn’t feel like Kobe was supposed to be celebrated this way, posthumously and with an overwhelming sense of finality. It’s an inexplicably grounding experience. For those in my generation, we don’t know of a world without Kobe. Every record broken, every big performance, we turn our ears to listen for Kobe’s insight. He was supposed to grow old to share his wisdom with future generations of superstars. To see the Mamba Mentality manifest itself in the youth that he inspired. To walk his daughters down the aisle. To live. It’s Kobe. Kobe can’t die.

And so it would appear that two days later, I’ve managed to find the words. And yet it still feels like it’s not enough. In the same way that words could not do his career justice, they seem to fall short in trying to make sense of his sudden absence. Death is confusing, and it’s hard. We react and process grief in different ways. For many, death is a reminder of the futility of life. For others, it’s viewed as a time to celebrate the lasting impact of a life lived. Kobe’s death is a reminder of both. The futility of life in the sense that no day is guaranteed but also by making us all realize that no life is futile if it is lived properly. He leaves behind a complex legacy. But he was an idol for so many different kinds of people, from LeBron James to a midwestern kid who rode the bench. Kobe became larger than life, and his spirit transcended sports.The Mamba Mentality will find its way back, as Kobe always did. After all, it’s Kobe. And Kobe can’t die.",nbadiscussion
1314,319,Duncan Robinson and Davis Bertans are having two of the all time greatest 3 point shooting seasons - 3 Point Value Over Replacement,"**Intro**


As the NBA becomes more and more of a three point shooting contest, talented shooting role players are becoming more impactful than ever. This year, Duncan Robinson (and to a similar degree Davis Bertans) are setting the new standard for three point shooting specialists as volume machines.

Robinson is currently shooting 43.8% from 3 on 8.1 attempts per game (13.4 attempts per 100 possessions, while Bertans is just behind at 42.4% on 8.5 attempts (13.4 per 100). While three point sharp shooters are nothing new, Robinson and Bertans are a new breed of super-shooter in terms of their volume and accuracy. 

Amongst players with reasonable numbers of games and minutes played, Robinson and Duncan trail only [Curry and Harden](http://bkref.com/tiny/NQmfe) seasons historically in terms of three pointers made per 100 possessions. Other role players dot the list, but Robinson and Bertans are historically efficient--setting a cutoff at [40% shooting](http://bkref.com/tiny/xm7dM) makes even clearer how much of outliers they are.

When naming all time great three point shooters we are drawn to accuracy first and foremost, and for good reason, since efficiency matters. But efficiency matters much less if you aren’t taking a ton of shots--a good three point shooter should shoot, and where Bertans and Robinson set themselves apart are in their volume. There’s a whole bunch of examples of 40% shooters in history, and a few crazy seasons coming close to or eclipsing 50%. But how many of these shooters were shooting 8 a game?



**Three Point Value Added Over Replacement**



We can measure the shooting value added by a three point shooter in a simple way. Assuming their shots were all given an average shooter, how many fewer points would be scored? This is the primary goal of a 3 point specialist--to hit shots other players would miss. This is a simple, but effective way at looking at the interplay between efficiency and volume by converting it to how many points would or wouldn't happen if the league average was shot instead.

This ignores gravity effects, and makes assumptions that the shots would be there if the players were changed. For extreme outliers like Curry this assumption doesn’t hold (he makes shots other players wouldn't make), but for catch and shoot specialists like Bertans and Robinson, I’m comfortable assuming that any random player could slot in and take those shots instead.



`ShotVolume * 3 * (PlayerAvgFromThree - LeagueAvgFromThree)`



**The List**

Duncan Robinson is near the top of a list filled with the best volume + efficiency seasons I could find from a whole bunch of historically renowned shooters. Per 100, he trails only 2012 Novak (which appears to be the all time greatest shooting value season), 2016 Curry (no surprise to anyone), 2016 Redick (a forgotten elite season!), and 2015 Korver (nearly 50% on volume!). Special shout out to Steve Novak, who appears to have one of the worst, and the very best, seasons of all time two years apart.

Duncan Robinson (and to a lesser but similar extent Davis Bertans) has provided one of the highest shooting value seasons of all time by a combination of volume and accuracy, while the most extreme outlier seasons rely on extreme accuracy over a relatively smaller number of shots. 

Duncan Robinson might not do much on the court besides take lots and lots and lots of threes, but he’s really, really good at that. He and Bertans are in relatively unprecedented territory as volume sharpshooters, and they are providing more value to their teams than most other three point specialists in league history.



**Please play around with this idea**



I tried to stick to a single season per player since I don't have access to all this data historically and so I can only build a list using manual data entry. If anyone wants to expand this idea to other player seasons, whole careers, or just see how many Steph Curry seasons litter the top 20, please do!

1315,320,"Who are the guys you really thought were gonna be stars, no matter how obviously wrong you were?","Inspired by [this video](https://youtu.be/VXScVtbRaZU), who are the players you really believed in? Remember, this is a safe space.

For me, I thought up until recently that Demar was going to be the next Kobe, but it’s more and more apparent he’s closer to being a T-Mac.

I was a huge believer in Denzel Valentine being picked up by the Bulls, thought he’d be a mature, fundamental complement to Jimmy Buckets. Nah.

I still think Melo to the Bulls in 2010 gives us a title or two. Derrick Rose, Carmelo Anthony, Joakim Noah, maybe even still having space for Carlos Boozer, that team gets past Miami once. We can also talk about Carmelo’s career trajectory if he gets drafted by the 04 Pistons instead of the 04 Nuggets.",nbadiscussion
1316,321,"If the MVP was awarded to the player deemed most valuable to their team as opposed to unofficially being awarded to 'the best player on the best team', which players would have won MVP in the past?","Just a bit of semantics but I'm interested in the discussion that is to be had here. Basically the way the current MVP award is presented is fine. It rewards an elite level of player and acknowledges the success that a team has had throughout a season.  
  
However, the award is called the Most Valuable Player.  
  
If the award didn't follow the unofficial criteria that I suggested, who are some players that would have won the award in years past. For example someone like Kemba Walker last season could have been MVP by this criteria. If the Hornets were without him they would likely have won under 20 games. Another example is Kevin Love back when he was on Minnesota, he was definitely the team carry on that team.

1317,322,Let’s change the NBA schedule forever,"So let’s say the NBA has to take 45 days off because of the Coronavirus. Stay away from people please. So let’s say we start up again May 1st. Teams have about 18 games left and we can finish that by early to mid June. They speed up the playoffs a little more than normal and they can absolutely finish the season by mid August. The NBA draft and free agency take place in late August and absolutely own sports this summer. Summer league turns to into Fall Ball and only plays on weekdays so they don’t compete with the NFL. 

This will force the league to start next year late so players have a proper offseason. Adam Silver also loves how many more people watched the Finals in August and decides we can do this every year. We start next year December 1st and future playoffs will start Memorial weekend and end around the first week of August. Repeat forever. 

Negatives: NBA players in the conference finals this year probably can’t play in the Olympics this year. Free agency has to compete with NFL preseason. 

Positives: I’m not as sports bored in the summer. NBA doesn’t have to compete with the NFL for most of the regular season.",nbadiscussion

1321,326,"Why Karl Malone is, in my eyes, the second best PF of all time","Karl isn't very liked as a person, which I can understand completely. Putting that aside, his basketball career was really admirable to say the least. Karl is 2nd all-time in points scored, a 2 time MVP, a 14 time All-NBA member and can be proud of the fact that he never missed the playoffs once during his 19 year career. That being said, it's no wonder that he's a top 5 PF of all time by 99% of people. While the majority of people have Timmy D ranked as their number one, the number two spot is wide open for discussion. Some people prefer the leader of the Mavs' miraculous playoff run of 2011, Dirk Nowitzki, others may go with the defense and energy of KG and some may even like the Round Mound of Rebound himself, Sir Charles Barkley, better. I'm personally going with the Mailman at that spot, largely because of only one reason.

&#x200B;

The year is 2003 and Karl Malone is 40 years old. He just averaged 21/8/5 and guided his Jazz team to the 2003 playoffs, where they sadly got beat by a superior Kings team straight away in 5 games. This was the third time in a row that the Jazz got bounced in the First Round and the team wasn't looking that good. Aside from Matt Harpring and a young AK 47, the Jazz didn't have a lot to offer. Stockton started to show his age, they had Calbert Cheaney and Greg Ostertag starting, they weren't really close to going deep in the playoffs and Malone knew that. Malone's contract was up and he decided to make a splash in free agency by joining Shaq and Kobe in LA, alongside Gary Payton, to make one final push for the ring that eluded him his entire career. The Lakers were set to take the league by storm and cruise to the 2004 championship.

&#x200B;

Karl made his Lakers debut against the Mavs, where he fell one assist short of a triple-double. The Lakers won their first 5 games with him recording a double-double in 4 of them. They both continued their great play later on - the Lakers were 19-5 and Karl was either recording or flirting with a double-double in every game. The man was averaging 15/10/4 on 57% TS playing alongside two of the top 5 players in the league, at 40 years of age. Then came December 21st and the game against the Suns where Karl injured his knee in a collision with Scott Williams. He went on to miss 39 games and came back in March. LA went 22-17 without the Mailman, which is still underachieving giving the star power they had. Karl came back in a loss against the Timberwolves, but his return jump-started the Lakers' good run of play. The team went on a 11 game win streak with him back and managed to close out the season with a 56-26 record which was good for the 3rd best record in the West, and, since they won their division, 2nd seed. Malone averaged 12/8/4 on 53% TS playing with a busted up knee. As for the Lakers difference with and without him, they were 34-8 with him, while being only 22-18 without him.

&#x200B;

Then came the playoffs and Houston in the First Round. The Lakers got past Houston in a gentleman's sweep with Karl playing amazing. He averaged 18/10/3 on 52% TS and his 30 points were the difference in their win in Game 4.  On to the next opponent, the Spurs and their star Tim Duncan. Timmy just averaged 22/12/3 and was 2nd in MVP voting, but Karl came ready. After SA winning the first two games, the Lakers started to neutralize Tim better and a key reason for that was Karl himself. He stood firm and didn't allow himself to get backed down deep by Tim, which allowed the Lakers' double team to be more effective. Tim went on to average ""only"" 18 points in the next 4 games with 38% shooting from the field and 4 turnovers a game, having a horrific 10 point, 29% shooting, 6 turnover game 3, with the Lakers winning all of them and advancing to the WCF.  The Timberwolves were waiting for them there and KG was, in my humble opinion, the clear-cut best player in the world that season. The front office finally got him some help in the form of Cassell and Sprewell and it paid dividends. Garnett dominated the entire series and Karl had a lot of trouble with him. Nonetheless, it was not enough and the Lakers won in 6. As for the Finals, Malone played games 1 and 2 before spraining his knee in game 3 and playing limited minutes through an injury in games 3 and 4. He was out for the last 2 games of the series which the Lakers lost. Karl, yet again, managed not to win a championship and retired without ever winning one.

&#x200B;

To this day I still believe the Lakers win the Finals if Malone was healthy. He was such an important piece to that team and that says a lot about him. To be able at age 40 to be a major, game-changing part of a championship contending team that already has Shaq, Kobe and Gary is incredible. The Lakers showed their true potential when Karl was playing. In comparison, Dirk was giving you okay scoring numbers on a bad team in his final years, KG was a non-factor in Brooklyn and in his second stint with Minnesota and Chuck was having weight issues in Houston and retired at 37. Karl could have easily stayed in Utah, averaged 20+/8+ and probably lost in the First Round again , but he decided to go to LA, take a way smaller role and play it to perfection. He was also a key part of slowing down prime Tim Duncan, the clear-cut best PF ever, which at that age is pretty impressive to say the least. He was getting interest from the Knicks and Spurs the following season and who knows for how long he could have kept it going if he wanted to. It's a real shame that a player of that caliber doesn't  have a ring to his name, but I guess we have Michael Jeffrey Jordan and the first injury of his career to thank for that. His durability and level of play at age 40 makes me give him the edge over Dirk, KG and Chuck.",nbadiscussion
1322,327,Who’s going to be LeBron’s successor as the face of the NBA?,"The league’s filled with talent. I wouldn’t consider Kevin Durant because he’s already 31, coming off a devastating injury. Kawhi is great as well but I don’t think his personality suits the role (also, he’s 29 years old). I believe Giannis has the potential to take the crown however he is from Greece (not saying that an overseas player cannot be the face of the league but history shows they’re American).

1324,329,How many losses are there in top 100 scoring games?,"As a Trail Blazers fan, I of course witnessed the great scoring feat and saddening loss this Friday. It reminded me of Devin Booker's 70-points, also in a loss. I decided to go through the top scoring games on basketball-reference, many of which are taken by Wilt Chamberlain, and find all of the games in which said record scorer's team lost the game. This made me realize that Wilt's stats **are quite inflated.** In the early 1960's, Wilt scored 60 points every week or so. That was a different time, y'all.

Edit: I did forget to actually answer my question! Of the 101 games on this list, there have been 28 losses, or 27.8%, with Wilt Chamberlain claiming 15.

[Here is the graph.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1weBgPnuNiEjIWydxJo258lW942aCLQ5puplH-q6v0xo/edit#gid=0)

[Stats come from here.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_game.html)

Notes:

1. There are actually 101 games on  [this list](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_game.html). This is because there were more games equal to games in the Top 100, and so they can't ""kick"" any games off of the list.
2. Wilt Chamberlain is 34/49 in top 100 scoring games, losing 15.
3. There has been one game that had multiple players score enough to enter the top 100 scoring games list: December 8, 1961, when Wilt Chamberlain scored 78, Elgin Baylor scored 63 and the Lakers beat the Warriors 151-147. Baylor shot .418% and Wilt shot .500%
4. Of the four 67-point games Wilt Chamberlain has, he lost three. No other player has a 67-point game.
5. James Harden is on the Single Game Points leaders list six times, but has only one loss.
6. Kobe Bryant is on the Single Game Points leaders list seven times, but has only one loss.
7. Michael Jordan is on the Single Game Points leaders list six times, and has two losses.
8. Devin Booker is on the Single Game Points leaders list twice, losing both times.
9. Current NBA players on this list are 9/15 in these high scoring games.
10. It was quite hard to work quickly on this, as I got confused when Wilt played for the San Francisco Warriors, Philadelphia Warriors, Philadelphia 76ers and Los Angeles Lakers, but also lost some of these high-scoring games to the Philadelphia 76ers and Lakers.
11. The Lakers have played ""spoiler"" to five of these high-scoring games, all of which against Wilt Chamberlain.
12. Oscar Robertson and the Cincinnati Royals spoiled Wilt's scoring outbursts three times.",nbadiscussion
1325,330,Would a Rockets championship result in another big change in NBA strategy?,"If these ""we dont need a center"" Rockets win and NBA championship this season, will we see another Warrior's-esque change of the game? Will teams start to trot out 5 guards/forwards in their starting lineup to prioritize outside shooting above all? Will the center position truly become obsolete? Will there be no more need for a big to have an inside-scoring skill set? 

I don't think so...not with so many talented bugs out there today, not all of whom are dominant from the outside. Embiid, KAT, AD, Jokic, Rudy Gobert's defensive prowess, and then guys like Capela and Drummond who are automatic double doubles. While they aren't knockdown outside shooters (some of them have the range), I dont think you can ignore that much talent and skill just because they aren't snipers. I do think we will see even more small ball lineups, and guys like Embiid and Gobert will get less playing time in close 4th quarter/guts of the game situations. I think we'll see a lot more shoot outs in close game situations. 

I think it's kind of impossible to make an entire position/skill set obsolete. To put it simply: a bucket is a fucking bucket; doesn't matter where u get it from. Elbow jumper, logo shot, transition layup, whatever. If you get more buckets than the other squad, you win. Maybe all it will take is some Shaq, Kareem, or Wilt type to dominate down low to get the game to change again. But I'm curious to know what other people think. What could a Rockets chip mean for the game of basketball?",nbadiscussion
1326,331,Was Horace Grant a good shooter?,"I recently got the Arcade1up NBA jam cab which is phenomenal and i'd recommend to everyone.  After beating all 27 teams in NBA Jam Tournament Edition you unlock a pretty extensive expanded roster, one of the new players being Horace Grant.  Was pretty excited to run him as a wingman for Pippen to find out his 3 point rating was a 1.  No one has a 1.  All the awkward 90s centers have like a 2-4.  So I pull up his advanced shooting stats and find something VERY interesting.  Horace shot 50.4 percent of shots from 16ft-3 and made an astounding 44.4 percent of them from 97-04.  04 was his lowest on both percentages, so not counting his retirement year you're a little higher on both.  Plus, 97, the first recorded year, he shot 48.1 percent and was still putting up 12.6 points a game.  This is the end of his career, not him prime.  Was Grant a SNIPER from midrange?  Anyone watch his career and have any insight?",nbadiscussion
1327,332,Who is your darkhorse candidate to make the finals in these 2020 Bubble Playoffs?,"Shoutout to u/Docter_Bogs for posting [Vegas Championship Odds](https://old.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ib3fk4/championship_odds_preplayoffs_bucks_52_clippers/) for these playoffs. As he pointed out, MIL and the two LA teams are huge favourites and there is a big dropoff in odds after those 3 teams. So my question is: outside of these three teams, who do you think has a great chance to make it to the Finals?

To me, BOS is that team. If they can survive TOR's defence in the second round, I think they will give MIL a run for their money. The Bucks defense is built around denying shots at the rim but the flipside is they allow a lot of threes. BOS is loaded with great shooters, they can play four-out and shoot lights out from downtown. They won't be able to stop Giannis, not with Kanter and Theis protecting the rim, but if they can limit all their other starters, I think BOS might have a shot in the series.",nbadiscussion
1328,333,How many solid role players is a superstar worth?,"   I’m a Toronto Raptors fan. This season has been incredibly fun to watch, from Terrence Davis playing so well, to Pascal Siakam taking another step forward. There is one thing that I’ve noticed from last year to this. The raptors team this year plays with grit, ball movement, solid team defence and great 3pt shooting. However there is a marked problem with the raptors against top teams. We just don’t have that player that can take over a game like Kawhi. When the shots just aren’t falling and you need someone to just create something we just do have it. This worries me immensely because in the playoffs as we all saw with the raptors against Philly, Kawhi had to go super sayian and we still barely won the series. The value of someone like that is incredible.


   So my question is a simple one, how valuable are superstars in comparison to role players. Is a superstar worth 5 solid role players, 6, 7? That’s the question I pose to you fine folks.",nbadiscussion

1330,335,[OC] Updating Kirk Goldsberry's Metric For Identifying Best Shooters In The NBA (2015 - 2020),"Couple of weeks ago there was a post on this sub titled [Kirk Goldsberry's Metric For Identifying Best Shooters In The NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/hkf2c7/kirk_goldsberrys_metric_for_identifying_best/), which was based on a discussion of his MIT Sloan Paper from 2012. 

You can find the [original paper here](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/46e4/a7271de62e9118625dec935c4aef1bc0ea74.pdf?_ga=2.34128227.376142319.1593761416-966256004.1592516502), but the tl;dr is that Goldsberry divided an NBA court into 1,284 unique 1ftx1ft zones and came up with two metrics to identify the most prolific and best shooters in the NBA. 

First, he calculated a player's Spread, which is the % of those 1,284 zones that a player has attempted at least one field goal from;

Second, he calculated a player's Range, which is the % of those 1,284 zones that a player has averaged at least one point per attempt from. 

In his original analysis, which spanned the 2006 - 2011 seasons, Goldsberry identified Kobe as the most prolific shooter (had the highest Spread at 83.4%) and Steve Nash as the best shooter (had the highest Range at 31.6%).  

I got bored so I tried to re-create Goldsberry's method for identifying the players with the highest Spread and Range over the last five seasons (2015 - 2020). 

I divided up the court a little differently than Goldsberry -- the biggest difference being that in my analysis I extended the shooting range to account for all attempts less than or equal to 32 feet from the hoop. Back in 2006 there werent a whole lot of players attempting shots from that deep so it wouldnt have made sense for Goldsberry to look at those attempts. 

Here's how the results shake out: 

##[Highest Spread](https://imgur.com/gVyzUwl) (aka, the most prolific/diverse shooters over the past seasons)

Again, these are the players who have taken at least one attempt from the most number of unique shooting zones. 

I think the biggest difference between this list and Goldsberry's list is that over the past five years the players with the highest Spread are the ones who can extend their shot selection way beyond the three point arc while 10 years ago the players with the highest Spread were the ones who shot from all over the mid-range area (Kobe, Dirk, Rudy Gay, etc...). 

[Here's Dame's Spread visualized.](https://imgur.com/4lLXTSV) 

##[Lowest Spread](https://imgur.com/gfRP6Jn) (aka, the least prolific/diverse shooters over the past seasons)

I also wanted to look at which players have shot from the fewest number of unique zones (minimum 2000 FGA over the past five seasons combined). 

It's basically a who's who list of rim runners + Ben Simmons (lol)


##[Highest Range](https://imgur.com/wBDHMTA) (aka, the best shooters over the past five seasons)

These are the players who have averaged at least one point per attempt from the most number of unique zones. 

Curry tops the list (surprise, surprise) followed by Klay and Kyrie. 

[Here are all the zones that Curry averaged at least one point per attempt from over the past five years.](https://imgur.com/Cei8vAI)

This is a fairly arbitrary metric and [some commentators in the other thread detailed its flaws](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/hkf2c7/kirk_goldsberrys_metric_for_identifying_best/fwtic47/), but it was fun for me to try and re-create an old Sloan paper

&#x200B;

Las Vegas

Now that T-Mobile Arena has been built, Las Vegas has been primed for sports franchises, with the NHL’s Golden Knights capitalizing on the opportunity. There’s already professional basketball in Las Vegas with the WNBA’s Aces, but they play in the nearby suburb of Paradise rather than in downtown Las Vegas. Despite the absolute insanity that was the 2007 All-Star Game, Las Vegas has maintained its hold as the official summer league of all thirty NBA teams. Black Knight Sports & Entertainment is actually the perfect group to start an NBA franchise, with the consortium’s first venture experiencing immediate success. The Vegas Golden Knights have quickly established themselves as a top-tier organization, which would be encouraging to the other NBA owners. Another thing that is encouraging is the major half of the consortium, the Maloof family. The Maloofs have owned both the Houston Rockets from 1979 to 1982 and the Sacramento Kings from 1998 to 2013. With an arena in place and an ownership group with sports pedigree, this might actually happen sooner rather than later.

&#x200B;

Louisville

&#x200B;

Louisville is such an interesting prospective NBA city to me because cities like these is where the NBA absolutely thrives. I can easily see Louisville being a team in the same vein as Salt Lake City or San Antonio, a small market that rallies around its only major pro sport. One of the biggest benefits of Louisville would be the ability to serve both southern Ohio and Kentucky. Louisville is less than two hours from Cincinnati, Ohio and an hour and a half from Lexington, Kentucky. This is another city with an arena in place, the KFC Yum! Center. Although used for college basketball, this arena is the largest basketball arena in the United States built right on the water of the Ohio River. If used by the right team, Louisville NBA could be a crown jewel of basketball in the south. There’s a strong basketball heritage in the state, both by the University of Kentucky basketball program and the ABA’s Kentucky Colonels. Five Hall of Famers played for the ABA stalwart and eleven Hall of Famers represent the university. I’d like to see Carl Linder III and his ownership group build a team in Louisville. His group has started the FC Cincinnati soccer club in 2015 as USL (American soccer’s second tier) club and in four short years, they reached the MLS, the highest level in America. If he chose to take his talents to Louisville, we could have a really fun team in an underrated city.

&#x200B;

Montreal

With Toronto finally winning a championship, it’s time to take the NBA to the great white north again. Montreal seems like a natural fit for Canadian expansion, with an immediate rivalry between Ontario and Quebec reminiscent of the Maple Leafs-Canadiens rivalries in the NHL. There’s such a cultural difference between the two provinces and cities, that the Raptors being the de facto Canadian national team might grow a movement in the rest of Canada that could be cultivated by one big star, similar to Vince Carter in Toronto. There’s a bit more risk here since there is no longer a Montreal franchise in the National Basketball League of Canada. However, that league began play in 2011 and early foldings are to be expected. The Molson family is a natural fit to run the franchise, with their ties to Montreal running deep. The Bell Centre is currently the home of the Canadiens and the ownership group that owns the stadium also runs the hockey team that fills it. Of the six preseason games that occurred in the Bell Centre, they were all sellouts. If that can be sustained over forty-one games, likely with more downs than ups due to being an expansion team in a city used to winning is the major question.

&#x200B;

Seattle

Do I need to explain why Seattle needs a team? The SuperSonics were NBA royalty for over forty years, before Clay Bennett moved the franchise to Oklahoma City in business-savvy yet opportunistic move. There’s an alternate universe out there somewhere where Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant are the next big tag team in Seattle, following in the footsteps of Lenny Wilkens/Spencer Haywood and Gary Payton/Shawn Kemp. The former home of the Sonics, the KeyArena, is currently under redevelopment under the name Seattle Center Arena and if redevelopment goes well, we should expect a team in the near future. The Seattle Storm have maintained a presence in Seattle as a proud WNBA franchise, whose owners could make a great group to run the NBA side. Eleven families have stake in the Seattle Sounders MLS team, who are the most valuable franchise in MLS. The three businesswomen who make up Force 10 and run the Seattle Storm would be an amazing group with any of the families who invested in the Sounders, hopefully bringing basketball back where it belongs in the Pacific Northwest.

&#x200B;

Vancouver

The Vancouver Grizzlies were kind of a failure. Lasting only six seasons before moving to Memphis, they were barely a blip in the radar of NBA history. The NHL’s Canucks were sold alongside the Rogers Centre in 2004 to the Aquelini group and with new developments going up around the arena, the NBA should be looking to make a return. A lot of the reasons I’d like to see Vancouver rejoin the NBA are similar to Montreal’s, but 4000 miles away. The Canucks have experienced more success recently as well as the Vancouver Whitecaps FC, with supporters reaching over 15000 in just their second MLS season. If Vancouver can last more than six seasons in a rebirth, it’d be a success. Having a face like Steve Nash joining the ownership group would be perfect as a liaison for the NBA and I think they could rebuild the image of basketball in British Columbia.

&#x200B;

Virginia Beach

I have a soft spot for Hampton Roads. After living there a few years and seeing how fans from seven different cities mobilized for their respective teams, I really want to see how they’d rally around a local team. The only arenas in the area are the Norfolk Scope and Hampton Coliseum, which aren’t really NBA-caliber arenas. I’m OK with a team in Richmond, which is about an hour away from Hampton Roads, but the Kings were in negotiations to move to the area from 2011 to 2013. Virginia Beach is kind of the ultimate small-market team in this list because this team would be starting from scratch. There’s no major team in the area, only various minor league teams, and an arena desperately needs to be built in order to make it happen. An arena could revitalize the area and doesn’t necessarily need to be on the waterfront. There was an arena plan that failed, but I think this is an “If-you-build-it-they-will-come” situation. The Virginia Squires are another ABA team who existed and with the pedigree of Julius Erving, George Gervin, Charlie Scott and Zelmo Beaty in the Hall Of Fame, there is a place for basketball. There’s almost 400 miles of real estate between Charlotte and Washington DC, fertile for a new fanbase to join the NBA.

Honolulu, Mexico City and San Juan

If Las Vegas receives an NBA team, it makes sense to move the Summer League to a new city. Honolulu is a great place to stay for ten days, despite my bias from growing up in Hawaii. Honolulu can’t really support a team consistently, but is great for events and one-offs similar to the Pro Bowl. Mexico City would be a good place for international expansion, as would San Juan. A quick ten-day trip in an established vacation spot makes a ton of sense as a replacement.

&#x200B;

G League

Each of the teams have a few options as far as G League affiliates. The G League is the minor league of the NBA and the cities mentioned each have options. Las Vegas could resurrect the Reno Bighorns, Louisville could bring back the Arkansas RimRockers or the myriad of teams in the Carolinas. Montreal could bring back the Springfield Armor or put a team in Quebec City. Seattle has options in Bismarck, Boise or Tacoma. Vancouver could build in Calgary or the other teams in the Great Plains and Midwest. Virginia Beach could also use the Carolinas teams or bring back the Roanoke Dazzle.

Conclusion

I did this in NBA 2K19 and expanded with all six teams at once as a sort of reboot for the NBA. Free agency when every team has a maximum of eight players besides draftees would be insane and it would give the NBA a chance to restructure the divisions to a more geographically sound, cost-efficient way. NBA 2K19 puts the expansion teams right behind the top three teams in the draft, which makes sense, and is fair for the top three lottery picks. NBA owners are reportedly talking about a $2 billion entry fee to own a franchise, but the only team in the NBA that didn’t turn a profit were the Cleveland Cavaliers, who lost the biggest star of our generation, taking millions of revenue with him. The NBA would have a chance to do something unprecedented and I think the expansion draft of players with six teams could result in major stars moving as well as some up-and-comers having the cleanest of slates. NBA expansion is a very exciting prospect to me, on and off the court and seeing the league evolve both in business and in gameplay is something that could change sports forever.",nbadiscussion

1335,340,Am I the only one who thinks the Sixers really really messed up this free agency?,"Look I don't doubt the talents of Tobias Harris and Al Horford, but holy god those are insane overpays for an above-average starter and player not at a position of need whose best playing days are well behind him, respectively. 

I probably would've paid Harris around $25M/year (compared to $36M) and Horford around $15M (compared to $27M/year). Other teams, like the Nets and Knicks, paid for comparable players in terms of hard numbers (Deandre Jordan and Julius Randle, respectively) at much much lower costs.

Additionally, letting Jimmy Butler (who carried this team for many parts of the playoffs) and JJ Reddick go makes me question who the hell are the perimeter shooters for the team. Simmons can't shoot and I don't even know who is the backup SG for the team since they didn't shore up that position. I consider Richardson a SF, not a SG.

I seriously think the Sixers put themselves in a hard place financially, even if Kawhi leaves for LA.

1336,341,Using referee data to find which refs call the fairest game,"So basketball reference has [referee data](https://www.basketball-reference.com/referees/2020_register.html) from the past 31 seasons. Using that data, I wanted to find which refs this year called the fairest game. Here's basketball reference explanation behind these numbers:

""These columns take the referee's value for ""Home Minus Visitor"" and subtract the league average. For example, if the home team outscored the visiting team by 3.5 points per game in games officiated by this referee and the league average was 3.0 points per game, then the associated ""Relative to Average"" column would have a value of 3.5 - 3.0 = +0.5.""

What I've done is rank each referee (74 total this season) in each of the 5 categories that we have data for: W/L%, FGA, FTA, PF, and Points. The closer a ref was to being average, the better their ranking was (for me being +3 in a category was just as bad as being -3). After ranking the refs in each of those categories, I came up with who had the best overall ranking (I'm probably not explaining this well, but I'm pretty sure the numbers all add up).

With all that said, here are the top 20 refs from just this season:

So for people who watched the series and kept up with the NBA back then going into the 2014 finals who do you think was supposed to win the finals? Was it a even series (a toss up) or was there anything from the regular season that exposed the Heat and made people think they were gonna have trouble and werent the best team anymore.

1338,343,"The field of true ""MVP candidates"" is narrower than we think. Here are my top 3 most likely winners","Last season, Paul George had an incredible year for Oklahoma City. He averaged 28.0 points per game (4+ more than his previous career high) and played DPOY-caliber defense on the other end. By all reasonable standards, he was a true ""MVP candidate.""

Kind of. While George did finish 3rd overall in the voting tally, he didn't garner a single first-place vote. 78 for Giannis, 23 for Harden, 0 for George. So, sure, in theory, he was a ""finalist"" for MVP, but he wasn't actually a serious threat to *win* the trophy last season over those other two superstars. He was an MVP candidate in the same sense that Amy Klobuchar is a presidential candidate this year. They're in the discussion -- they're on the podium -- but they're unlikely to actually win.

If we use that standard of candidate (a player who is a viable threat to win *first-place* votes), then the bar rises significantly. In fact, it may only be a handful of names. Let's go through some of those now, and rank the 3 candidates that appear ahead of the pack to me.

######**theoretically possible, but would need some narrative**

**PG Kyrie Irving, Brooklyn**

Kyrie Irving (and Donovan Mitchell and a healthy Victor Oladipo) are great examples of players who get floated out as potential MVP candidates during the pre-season by people who want to find darkhorses and sleepers. And there's some logic there. After all, Kyrie Irving will be in a great situation to pump in points for Brooklyn. He may even lead them to a top 4-5 seed in the process.

I wouldn't discount Irving having a great year, but league *MVP* is simply a higher bar than he's proven capable of reaching so far (now at age 26.) If you cherry pick his career highs in different categories, he'd average 25.2 points and 6.9 assists a game. Great numbers. Possibly good enough to be 2nd team All-NBA numbers. But MVP? Not really that close. Consider this: over the last three seasons, James Harden has averaged 31.8 points and 9.2 assists per game. Maybe Kyrie Irving ups his numbers to 27-8 range, but he's still not getting high enough to match the elite marks of the modern era.

If we're looking for a realistic path to MVP for Irving, it may come from unexpected team success. If the Nets can somehow get up to the 2-3 seed range, I can see him mustering up votes and potentially finishing in the top 3. Still, I don't see him *winning* as a particularly likely scenario.

**C Joel Embiid, Philadelphia**

Based on pure stats, Joel Embiid isn't too far removed from MVP status. Last season, he averaged 27.5 points, 13.6 rebounds, and 3.7 assists a game to go along with top-notch defense.

To his credit, he also notched a career high in ""games."" The problem...? That number was only 64. If he's actually going to win MVP, Embiid will have to at least crack the 70 games mark. And given the Sixers' situation (a likely top 2 seed in the soft Eastern Conference), they don't really need to push the pedal to the medal like that. They'd be smarter to manage Embiid's minutes and health to make sure he's 100% by the time the playoffs start.

To be fair, we can't deny that there is a *potential* lane for his MVP. Like Irving, it would have to come with a lot of team success. The Sixers would need to grab the # 1 seed out East, with 60+ wins, and with Embiid being the centerpiece for a dominant defense. Again, possible. Likely? Not really. Last season, the Sixers' finished 15th in defense and won 51 games (with an expected win total of 48.) 

**C Nikola Jokic, Denver**

It's been a banner years for Jokers in the NBA standings and at the movie box office, but it's hard to bet on a scenario where that culminates in MVP honors. Like Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic is more likely fighting for 1st team All-NBA than actual MVP.

Statistically, he's close to being a legitimate MVP, registering 20.1 points, 10.8 rebounds, and a stellar 7.3 assists last season (in only 31 minutes a game.) Still, those aren't quite MVP-numbers in the modern NBA. To actually grab the trophy, Jokic would need to ride a considerable amount of narrative wave. The most likely way to do that, of course, is a massive amount of team success. The Nuggets would need to grab the # 1 seed out West, and allow Jokic to garner the credit for that with the media.

How likely is it that the Denver Nuggets finish with the # 1 seed? It's not terribly far-fetched. After all, they finished at # 2 last season with 54 wins. Their ""expected"" win total (based on advanced stats and point differential and such) only graded them at 51-31, but it's possible they get up to the 55 range based on natural improvement from their young bucks. And it's possible that's good enough to grab the 1 seed. That said, the West is going to be a fire fight, with Houston, Utah, and both L.A. teams in contention for that top spot. And if it's *close* (say a few wins difference), that still may not be enough for Jokic to win out over players with gaudier stats below him.

######**possible, but would need an (un)lucky break**

**SF LeBron James and PF Anthony Davis, L.A. Lakers**

When Kevin Durant joined the Golden State Warriors, he took an ""easy road"" to the NBA title. That said, he probably guaranteed himself that he wouldn't be winning an MVP during his time there. In many ways, Durant and Steph Curry would ""cancel each other out"" and make it hard for either of them to win over the other. Remember, the only year that Durant won MVP in Oklahoma City was back when Russell Westbrook missed extended time.

It's likely that the same situation applies here in L.A. with LeBron James and Anthony Davis. On paper, they should be MVP candidates. They're top 5 players (when healthy) on what should be a top 5 team. I can see LeBron James riding his ""point guard LeBron!"" narrative into 9+ assists a game, and earning a lot of buzz for that. Alternatively, Anthony Davis could put up his usual beastly numbers (28-12 with great defensive stats) and finally earn the spotlight that's alluded him in New Orleans. But like KD and Curry, it's going to be hard for one of these superstars to make an MVP case over the other.

Unless... an ""unlucky"" break occurs. That is: injury. If either LeBron or AD misses extended time (15-20+ games), that should be a boon to the candidacy of the other player. Both stars are more than capable racking up gaudy numbers when playing together, but they may put up ungodly numbers on their own.

**SF Kawhi Leonard, L.A. Clippers**

Of all our candidates or fringe candidates, Kawhi Leonard is the one that I expect to receive the most flak about (not ranking in the top 3.) After all, this is a player that many here on /NBA consider the best player on the planet. This is a player who will anchor the team considered most likely to win the title. And this is a player who has finished as high as # 2 (in 2015-16) and # 3 (in 2016-17) in MVP voting before. It's easy to see a scenario where he upgrades from silver and bronze to gold.

That said, there are a few factors working against him. For one, those top 3 finishes came pre-Zaza and back when Leonard was locked in on both ends every night. Based on what we saw last season, his night-to-night intensity (especially on defense) had taken a step back. He also played a modest 60 games thanks to load management, a number not far removed from his career average (in total, he's averaged 62 / 82 games per regular season.) He may only be 28 years old, but his body has more wear and tear than that age may indicate.

Here's where the ""lucky""/""unlucky"" break would have to come in for him to win MVP. For starters, Kawhi Leonard would obviously need to stay healthy for at least 70-75 games. And alternatively, new teammate Paul George would probably have to miss even more time than expected. If PG13 isn't around, Leonard's numbers will look better, and his impact on the Clippers will look more pronounced. In *that* case, he'd be given the lion's share of the credit for their team success. The idea of the Clippers winning the # 1 seed isn't far-fetched at all, so it's quite possible that Leonard will ride that momentum to MVP. Still, there's a lot of factors that would need to go in his favor for this to happen, which is why I don't consider him a top 3 candidate overall. 

######**more than possible. our most likely MVP winners**

**(3) SG James Harden, Houston**

As mentioned before, James Harden has averaged 31.8 points and 9.2 assists per game over the past three seasons. In that time, the Houston Rockets have averaged 57.7 wins. It's a historic stretch on par with the greatest offensive players of all-time. Given that, it's a surprise that Harden has only won the MVP one time (although he has 3 runner-up finishes in his career.)

What's more terrifying from the league perspective is that Harden isn't slowing down; arguably, he's getting better. He's launching *more* threes (going from 8.0 to 9.3 to 10.0 to 13.2 per game) and consequently ballooned up to 36.1 points per game last season. And as we know, he does that with stellar efficiency (over 61% true shooting over each of the last three years.) James Harden and Daryl Morey are on the right side of history here with their advanced stats and analytics; as time goes on, more and more writers will embrace those numbers as well. In fact, voters have already been made to look foolish for under-appreciating Harden in the past.

With Russell Westbrook coming over in place of Chris Paul, Harden's raw numbers may take a step back to some extent. After all, Westbrook is a high-usage player who plays a lot more often than CP3 did. But still, if Harden needs to take a step back, then there's still a LOT of wiggle room here. Consider this: if Harden scores 400 less points this season in the same amount of games, he'd *still* average 31.0 points per game.

In terms of ""narrative"" and ""fresh storylines,"" Harden has some hurdles to overcome. Houston grabbing the # 1 seed again would help quite a bit. But the Rockets should still win 50-55 games fairly easily; Harden should still average close to 30-8 fairly easily. He's proven, consistent, and durable. Essentially, Harden is the ""bar"" that all other MVP candidates need to be measured against, and he's the reason it's so hard to leap past him into credible contender status.

**(2) PF Giannis Antetoukounmpo, Milwaukee**

The recipe for Giannis Antetoukounmpo to repeat as MVP is simple. Just repeat what you did last year. If he can match the same production (27.7 PPG, 12.5 rebounds, 5.9 assists, strong defense) along with the # 1 seed on Milwaukee, he'll be in the catbird seat once again. Hell, even if Giannis and the Bucks take a slight step back (let's say 26-10-5 with 55 wins) that still may be enough to get the job done. Like a transcendent political candidate, he brings in multiple camps to the tent: those who love advanced stats, and those traditionalists who want ""wins!"" 

There's a perception that Antetoukounmpo is hurt by the fact that he won last year, and that the media craves new storylines and narratives. That's true -- to some extent -- but not wholly true. Since 2001, the newly crowned MVP has repeated 5 separate times (Tim Duncan, Steve Nash, LeBron James, LeBron again after a Derrick Rose intermission, and Steph Curry.) That's not far removed from the times the MVP has *not* repeated (7).

The reason that I'd rank Antetoukounmpo slightly higher than Harden is because the Bucks should have a cleaner lane to the # 1 seed. But clearly, the two of them are true forces who will be tough candidates to beat for the MVP presuming they stay healthy.

**(1) PG Steph Curry, Golden State**

There's very little ""projection"" involved with Giannis Antetoukounmpo winning MVP -- just do what you did last year. Similarly, Steph Curry has already proven he has the goods and the formula to do this; he did it twice before. All he needs to do is repeat his success from a few seasons ago.

In fact, there's a chance that Curry could have his BEST season statistically. Consider this: the last time we saw peak Steph Curry (prior to Kevin Durant), he scored 30.1 points per game and launched 11.2 threes per game (making 45.4%). I wouldn't necessarily say that Curry took a backseat to Durant over the last three years, but he at least took turns driving the bus. With KD gone and Klay Thompson injured, Curry will be getting all the work that he can handle. If Curry ups his three-point bombs in the same fashion that James Harden has done in the last few years (remember, going from 8.0 to 13.2) then what will that look like? Will Curry launch 14-15 threes a game? If he does, the records and MVP buzz will surely follow. Game to game and shot to shot, he can be even more of a cheat code than James Harden himself. 

That said, the most underrated element of James Harden's game is his durability; the dude is a steel robot who can play 35 minutes a game for 80 games a year. Can Steph Curry do the same? At this stage of his career? TBD. That's the biggest hurdle that Curry will need to overcome to win MVP again, now at age 31.

But the reason I'd rank Curry as the # 1 most likely MVP (over Harden and Giannis) is because he doesn't necessarily need the top seed in the West to earn the trophy. The expectations aren't terribly high for the Golden State Warriors this year (over/under is less than 50.) So if Curry can crack 50+ wins and lead the Warriors to a top 4 seed, that should be enough to rev up the campaign bus again.",nbadiscussion
1339,344,"If Kyrie Irving was drafted in any other years after 2011, do you think he would still be consensus #1 lottery pick?","Basically, skill-based point guards seem to be overlooked in this day and age. Athleticism seem to be a priority for a #1 pick. These days, lottery picks are taken up by athletic wings or big man.

Obviously Kyrie is a talented player, one of the most well-rounded point guards that came into the league but wasn't known to be extremely explosive like the Wall's, Rose's at the time.

1340,345,Undersized Power Forwards,"So I'm a Heat fan, and I was surprised to find out recently that Derrick Jones Jr is an undersized power forward. Derrick Jones Jr is a 6'6"" 210lbs power forward (according to [https://www.nba.com/heat/roster/derrick-jones-jr-bio](https://www.nba.com/heat/roster/derrick-jones-jr-bio)) Is this necessarily a bad thing? His build is pretty similar to Udonis Haslem tho albeit a little smaller, and he was a pretty good defender in his prime IIRC.

Watching highlights of Heat games I've seen him struggle on defence guarding the likes of Giannis or Tatum, so defensively his small figure is already a little bit of an issue.

1343,348,"Who do you take in a Bo7 series, the 2016 Oklahoma City Thunder or the 2018 Houston Rockets?","During the quarantine i´ve watched the 2016 and 2018 playoffs again, and i wonder which team would have the edge.

**Rosters and key players:**

1. Oklahoma City Thunder

Guards: Russell Westbrook, Andre Roberson, Dion Waiters, Randy Foye

Forwards: Kevin Durant, Serge Ibaka, Anthony Morrow

Centers: Steven Adams, Enes Kanter

2. Houston Rockets

Guards: Chris Paul, James Harden, Eric Gordon, Gerald Green

Forwards: Trevor Ariza, Luc Mbah a Moute, PJ Tucker, Ryan Anderson, Joe Johnson

Centers: Clint Capela, Nene

&#x200B;

**Key matchups:**

James Harden - Andre Roberson

Andre Roberson was the best perimeter defender for the Thunder in that season. I am sure he could give Harden some trouble, but given Hardens strenghts in the isolation he would get his points nontheless.

Chris Paul - Russell Westbrook

Can CP3 stop Russ going to the rim is the big question. On the other hand Russ would have to guard CP3. His on ball defense in the playoffs was solid most of the time, but will he have enough energy left for his offense? CP3 is maybe the best two way guard ever, so this matchup would be big.

Trevor Ariza/PJ Tucker - Kevin Durant

This is probably the biggest task for the Rockets defense. KD´s isolation scoring and athleticism combined with his height is unmatched, he is the player who is maybe the hardest to guard. However Ariza with his length and even Tucker as an undersized Forward can give Durant a lot of trouble.

&#x200B;

**Bench scoring:**

When it comes to scoring off the bench, the Rockets probably have the biggest advantage. The key players off the bench for the Thunder are Kanter, Waiters, Foye and Morrow. However most of them are pretty bad defensively, and with the Rockets going small for big parts off the game, Harden, Gordon and CP3 would get buckets pretty easily, especially with their drives. The Rockets have Gordon as their former 6th man off the year, Green, Mbah a Moute, Anderson and Johnson as their main bench players. All of them can shoot well, and everyone but Green and Anderson are solid defenders as well. So in this area the Rockets have a clear advantage.

**Prediction:**

Personally i´d say the Rockets would win this series in 6 games. The Thunder should dominate in the paint with Adams, Kanter and Ibaka, but the Rockets defense gives them the edge in my opinion. CP3 if healthy can guard Russ pretty well, and they have a pretty big advantage when it comes to shooting. KD often struggled against athletic wing defenders (Iguodala, Allen), and if Ariza and Tucker can stop him a bit, i don´t see a way for the Thunder winning this one.

1344,349,David Stern Career Accomplishments,"Sad news as David Stern passed away today. He wasn’t always the most popular during his tenure, but it’s clear now that he was a massive influence in helping the NBA to where it is today. I think he’s the best Pro-Sports commissioner of his era. 

Some of his accomplishments:

• Worked as a lawyer during the NBA/ABA merger before he was commish. Loose Balls (great book, highly recommend) highlights Stern’s efforts during this era, and shows how it wouldn’t have happened without him

• He created player free agency during this process, also the salary cap

• Distanced league image away from the “cocaine era”

• He personally did a lot of work on the league’s television rights, parlaying the famous tape-delayed finals into today’s massive TV deals

• A huge portion of the NBA’s Global efforts are a result of Stern 

• Expanded league to 30 teams (such a tough process to execute well, expansion teams failed many times during NBA’s history)

• Helped create NBA league pass

• Beat the 2012 lockout as a last hurrah (also 3 others during his reign)

I really think Stern is an NBA great, these are just some of his accomplishments. 

I hypothesize, as with anyone is his position, that a lot of his best work comes behind closed doors. We don’t really hear about the day to day battles, and I think Stern has done even more than meets the eye. 

I’m also curious how Stern would handle some of the challenges Silver is facing right now. I’m a fan of Silver, but haven’t loved how the soon-to-be rule changes have come about. I wonder how Stern would face the declining ratings and need to “switch things up”.

They're 6-7 time all stars but those were mainly as reserves in a week Eastern conference, both players only made 1 All-NBA team. Ultimately though based on worse selections they'll probably get in.  
  
So using that as an example, who is the worst player who you'd induct into to the hall of fame based on their career?",nbadiscussion
1347,352,[OC] A Mountain-Sized Hole Cannot Be Fixed By One Player - The Concerning Status of the New Orleans Pelicans,"There are certain players that you don’t truly appreciate until you see them in person, as if the television doesn’t do the player enough justice. Sitting in the final row of Cameron Indoor, I sat in a crammed section to watch the freaks how that was Zion Williamson playing basketball. 

In what was a rematch of the infamous 2002 NCAA Basketball Tournament Upset, Zion Williamson put on a clinic of incredible rim protection, transition offense and a ‘pick-up basketball two-man’ offense, he lived up to expectations. But watching his swiftness, is agility, how he physically dominated his competitors couldn’t be explained. He also looked fat. Just confirming that rumor. 

His draft value was reasonable. He had the ability to be a transcendent player in the right environment. The physical tools that couldn’t be taught, his marketability, his ability to simply play the game of basketball were all there. 

New Orleans was making an extremely easy decision when they were on the clock with the first pick in the draft. Zion Williamson would be the star to replace Anthony Davis. He would lead the new era of New Orleans.

And then…they fucked it up. Kind of. Here’s why.

Zion Williamson is a very talented player with a fairly limited game. This isn’t necessarily a terrible thing, we still remember some of the greats that excelled at a limited game. The problem is that these types of players require resources around their game—which is a tough ask, especially for a player two years removed from high school. 

The Zion dilemma is pretty interesting. Back in college, we remember his highlight reel performances, seemingly on every play he scored. When he went quiet, you could hear a pen drop in the building. In the infamous game against Louisville, where Duke stormed back thanks to heat check performances from RJ Barrett, Cam Reddish and a disappearing act from Jordan Nwora, Zion was shutdown in the first half and the mystery behind the man seemingly washed away for the moment.

People were not kidding when they said Zion’s game was built for the biggest stages. He explodes to the basket with his big frame, is extremely aggressive with his decision on the defensive end and he likes to dunk. Not necessarily an excellent perimeter defender, he enjoys being stretched across able to jump in front of a pass, even if at times, [he’ll get burned for his decision making](https://youtu.be/J5nykLPRi6M?t=22). In the half court environment, his powers can be contained. Until he can truly develop his shot from deep—which he is actively working on—teams can cheat his drive and inside game. 

It takes a while to get a freight train up to speed but when you do, it is difficult stop. It perfectly describes Zion’s ability—he needs the build-up to go at his full speed.

So when the New Orleans Pelicans built their 2019-2020 Roster, there were a lot of questions.

David Griffin and his soon-to-be hired GM Trajan Langdon entered a dream situation. Tasked with trading a player wanted by most, they brought in a haul fitting for one of the best players in the association. The talent they would bring in would be seen as the foundation for what is yet to come—a creative point guard, a potential star small-forward and a talented off-the-bench forward as well as three near-future picks and 1 potential pick-swap. 

They would complete another trade—sending off Solomill Hil and the fourth overall, 57th overall and another pick for three draft 2019 draft picks—8, 17 and 35. 

And they would lose Julius Randle , Cheick Diallo, Elfred Payton among others to the waves of the off-season.

It was an incredibly active off-season for the Pelicans. Its why the draft was so important because Griffin’s stockpile play needed to pay off. The talent drafted is good, it just didn’t make sense for the new team. 

New Orleans drafted  three players that would benefit from the two-man system, the system previously managed by Alvin Gentry, Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday. Ingram, Hart and Ball were all coming from a motion based offense and the questionable world that is ‘LeBron Ball.’ Because of the investment in talent that could shoot, Gentry made the choice to go against the newly drafted talent and go with the somewhat know, flexing the offense around the perimeter—they quietly would go from the lowest three-point attempts to most. 

The new team feels different, which it should. It sort of feels like every teen movie where two opposite cultures are forced to work together for the greater good. Immediately, we have the kid news on the block taking over and the old crowd is lost.

The media has been disappointed with Jrue Holiday. Statistically, not much has changed—its pretty incredible. He’s reflecting same amount of %FGA being 3 point shots (31.3) and %FGA being 2 point attempts (31.3), still hanging around the 20 points per game amount, with around 17.5 attempts a game. He’s still seeing a usage rate around 25% and is still accounting for about 24% of the team’s points per game. 

But we must go deeper. 

He’s begun to step away from the mid-range game and is stepping into the efficiency realm. He’s reduced his percentage of  points from mid-range by 3 points, increased his percentage of points from behind the arch by 5% and increased his percentage of points from fast break by 2%. 

Even deeper—his  turnover ratio took an interesting turn. Since making the transition to primarily being a 2-guard in 2016, this is first year year of having a 2:1 ratio on Bad pass versus lost ball turnover. In previous years, we could expect the bad pass to lost ball ratio to be around 3:1. Its been the one tell that we’re able to see, where Jrue Holiday is experiencing some sort of issues. 

Off-ball Jrue isn’t a problem—the problem has been how the line-ups exist with different builds. With Lonzo Ball in the line-up, Gentry loves to execute more motion based offense. There isn’t a coincidence that with Lonzo on the court, the Pelicans are committing more turnovers and are getting outscored despite taking an increased number of three point attempts.

Lonzo enjoys pushing the pace and has a pretty solid control of the offense. But at times, it can feel like he is attempting to push things too fast and it leads to a careless mid range jumper or a quick three point shot. His movement and spacing on the floor has been a great compliment to Jrue. But when they are on the floor together but the shots don’t fall. When Jrue leads the offense with both guards on the floor, often times Lonzo is required to make the key jumper, following the drive from Holiday and cannot hit.

The motion offense is meant to set-up Brandon Ingram as much as possible but in reality, he excels just through the concept of searching for the open shot. Because of the natural floor spacing, Ingram’s shot selection has been incredibly balanced—28.7% of his shots being catch-and shoot, 32.2% of his shots being pull-ups and 37.5% coming 10 feet or less. If the motion office was truly the key reason for why Brandon Ingram was excelling, we would see an increased number of his shots coming form the catch-and-shoot. 

Its a bit crazy how Brandon Ingram just basically creates a two-man offense when the ball is in his hands. [He loves the high screen at the top of the key](https://youtu.be/A4I-MupWq6Y?t=14) and [will basically wait for a play to develop just for someone to bring him a high screen for additional spacing](https://youtu.be/A4I-MupWq6Y?t=40). Its why he’s able to get 43% of his shoots with 4+ feet of space between him and his closest defender and is able to only have 10% of his shots be ‘tightly defended’ (less than 2 feet of space between him and the nearest defender). 

The motion offense also requires a lot more attention to detail. Every pass and dribble becomes more meaningful. [Penetrating drives that are meant to create space are now attacked a lot more to force the mistake](https://youtu.be/ENNSjUuJVzg?t=68)—similar to how you would run a blitz in the NFL. [The simple pass can be missed](https://youtu.be/8LbYjz4RieU?t=354). It makes sense why the team has a higher percentage of their points coming from the fast break versus others--their half court isn't good. Sloppy mistakes, poor decisions and the requirement of having the ball to go into the basket isn't working in their favor.

And even with the Pelicans being reliant on the long ball—averaging the 5th most 3-point attempts and hitting the 4th most three pointers a game, they still aren’t the best from the field—shooting 44.5% and average the 7th most turnovers per game. They also average the 6th lowest percentage of points in the paint (40.6%). The motion offense requires a lot to go right—its not something that can be executed by only usable talent.

Usable talent is a good phrase to describe the Pelicans. Because of the wealth of usable talent, it sometimes leads to a loss of definition. The testing period to see what talent would possibly take the next step—or the Brandon Ingram ‘Most Improved Player’ project has worked. But at what cost? 

Lonzo Ball has entered another environment where it doesn’t feel that he will fit. Jrue Holiday’s ball-handling hoes has come to fruition with how teams are able to collapse on his drive and force a turnover. JJ Redick finally has shown signs of aging. And draft talent is stuck not developing their own game—Nickel Walker-Alexander and Jaxson Hayes are receiving meaningful time but in various different roles, leading to questionable development practices.

The real future of the team will be determined when Zion comes back. Because when Zion comes back, we’ll see the missing two-man game.

Before the season, we saw glimpses of what could have been. Zion’s ability to stretch the floor, with his athleticism and handles would have opened the floor through crafty cuts to the basket or sitting at the top of the key and driving his way to the basket. More importantly, it seemed like the perfect pairing for Lonzo Ball and how the two had highlight connections on the fast break as well as executing quick possessions. 

It feels that the team is still searching for answers. *Is Brandon Ingram finally finding his form and will be able to reach his full potential?* *Is Jrue Holiday going to be the future of the team or should they sell while his stock is still towards its peak?* *How will Zion fit in a motion offense?* *Is Gentry going to return to a two-man game once shown with Anthony Davis when Zion returns?* *Can Lonzo Ball finally have a system to be just a creator?* 

All we know right now is that the team is not good and people don’t understand why the team is struggling. A team that is searching for a definition is going about it the wrong way. Their motion offense continues to get punished without the right talent. In the mean time, stockpiling usable talent is leading to misused depth and questionable managerial choices. 

If the Pelicans are expecting Zion to fix all of their problems, its possible but highly unlikely. Expecting a team that completed a 180 adjustment to make another 180 adjustment is a lot of ask. A team that currently players. A team with enough talent to function and a team where the talent is performing well individually but not as a whole needs to be able to create a vision for the future.",nbadiscussion
1348,353,Which season was Serge Ibaka's peak?,"I remember the Iblocka era and a lot of people at the time that felt Ibaka-Russ-KD were a good enough big 3 and Thunder got decent enough value for Harden. This was when Ibaka was all team first defense and kept blocking shots like crazy.

1349,354,"[OC] A look at amazing defensive season by The Stifle Tower, Rudy Gobert","Back to back Defensive Player of the Year in the NBA and by probably the top candidate for another one. Although he was never
selected to the All Star team, which, in my subjective opinion, is undeserved, Gobert has been a player of
incredible value ​​for the Utah Jazz. Their entire defense scheme is based on Gobert.

In the first [chart](https://i.imgur.com/W65gIId.png), I showed how big the difference between Gobert and the other Utah Jazz players really is when it comes to amount of defended shots. Also, there is a very big difference in the success of defending the shot for two of them..

What I have noticed on several occasions while watching the Jazz team is that the players on which the pick is made are always going over the pick, as shown [here](https://streamable.com/1tr8l). In my opinion I think they are trying to prevent three point attempt, because they have a security blanket in Gobert waiting for a potential pass or a drive from a ball handler so they can afford the risk of going over the pick. Maybe
 my doubts are confirmed by a [chart](https://i.imgur.com/TBLeaLr.png) comparing the number of allowed 2 point and 3 point shots, which shows exactly how Utah allows very little three pointers.

Because of these things, Gobert is the player who defends the most shots in the game, the [figure](https://i.imgur.com/ff5IWBi.png) shows he defends 19.7 shots per game,
and what is even more impressive is that the success rate of the opposing players is only 39.8%!!!! With that percentage he is
at about 20th rank in entire NBA (when looking at players who have played at least 20 games) which is really impressive when we consider
that Pascal Siakam is the closest to Gobert with 14.7 shots allowed per game while allowing a smaller percentage of shots to the opponent.

You can see this information on the [chart](https://i.imgur.com/ff5IWBi.png), I have extracted the names of some players who defend a lot of shots, here the only goal was to show how big the difference is between Gobert and the other players on the subject.

If I limit the [data to only 2-point shots](https://i.imgur.com/x8yKjQP.png), then Gobert moves into the top 5 by opponent's shot percentage.
Interestingly, there are three Milwaukee players, Giannis, Middleton and Matthews in front of him, but they have significantly fewer shots allowed
(6.1, 3.7 and 4.0 respectively). When it comes to the Bucks, we still have to praise Brooke Lopez, who is also a very good defensive player. But that fact
is actually another plus for Gobert, as it shows how much he stands out with Utah on defense ..

Speaking of some more data, Gobert is also 3rd (!!!!!) in Win Shares in the league this season, mostly because of
Defensive Win Shares (DWS). Win Share is a statistic that estimates the number of wins a player has contributed. So Gobert currently has
7.4 WS, 3.1 of which are defensive.

And even though this is a defense analysis, I will also touch on the offensive side of Gobert, where he should be praised in one not so closely followed segment,
Screen Assists. He leads the league in Screen assists and points earned through them.

Given that Utah is playing Dallas Mavericks in couple of hours, who have the NBA's best offense (if we're looking at Off Rating), we can conclude that we will have a very interesting game in front of us.

1351,356,Sam Anderson (author of Boom Town - about OKC and the Thunder) on the Lowe Post pod explains his conspiracy theory on Russell Westbrook having the ‘yips’ which caused his shooting to deteriorate.,"*self-transcribed - * At 37:45 of Pod: “[Russell Westbrook]’s got these **incredibly precise routines that he **never** ever deviates from.  The NBA in the off-season in an effort to speed up the game changes the rules surrounding free-throw shooting routines.  You are no longer allowed to walk outside of the three-point line between free throws.  Russell Westbrooks routine has always been, since I think he was **eight years old**, to walk from the free throw line to half court, walk back, take the ball, and shoot the free throw.  In my conspiracy theory, it was the changing of that rule that messed up the whole delicate balance of his routines and made him get into his head and start missing free throws all of a sudden which he never had a problem with.  He’s a clutch free throw shooter.  He’s great.   Umm.. he started missing free throws and that got into his head.  And it, his you know his **cotton shot** is essentially a free-throw shot on the run [Russ used to shoot the pull-up at the free-throw effective].

1352,357,Who benefits and who gets hurt most by the break?,"Assuming that the NBA returns, as planned, in mid July, with a training camp and some sort of preseason type warmup games or scrimmages, when the playoffs start, which teams do you think will end up benefitting or being hurt the most by the break?

Starting with the teams at the top, I think the Lakers are huge beneficiaries, while the Bucks are potentially hurt the most.

For the Lakers, LeBron had been pushing himself harder on both ends of the floor than he had for years, in the regular season. At his age, there was a risk he was going to be rundown in the playoffs and not have as much left in the tank. It feels like guys like him and Chris Paul will benefit greatly by having a nice rest before the playoffs and coming in fresh.

On the other hand, the Bucks were fresh. Their best players played super low minutes all year. They also had a nice cushion in the standings and would have had as much chance to rest up as they wanted. They were also a team with a lot of momentum, and had some conference rivals like the Raptors and Sixers who were beaten up with injuries that will now have had the chance to heal. They were also a great home team who now essentially loses the home court advantage through the playoffs that they had earned.

For the other top teams, the Raps had been beaten up with injures all year, and had to ride their older star Lowry pretty heavy minutes because of it. They seem like beneficiaries for the same reason as the Lakers. Meanwhile, I'm not sure what to think about the Clippers. Their key guys were resting, as it was, so I think they were always set up to be fresh in the playoffs, but having a training camp with Kawhi and PG seems like it could really help the team's chemistry.

From the next tier of contenders, the team I think becomes the most dangerous now is the Pacers. Oladipo looked out of sorts when he came back from injury, but he got some reps in followed by a nice long break. A lot of people said that he would look much better after an offseason, and it looks like he got one early. With a healthier Oladipo and a training camp to integrate him the Pacers could be a really scary playoff opponent.

Similarly, the Mavs strike me as another really scary team. Porzingis was farther along in his recovery, but clearly still getting his legs under him and getting back up to speed. The break could be a huge boost for him. A training camp with Luka, now that he has his feet under him, could really help them iron out the kinks in their two man game.

So what are your thoughts about winners and losers from the break?",nbadiscussion
1353,358,What if Steve Ballmer moved the Clippers to Seattle in 2014?,"I’m listening to the Knuckleheads podcast with Shaq talking about the Clippers and how Steve Ballmer changed the culture there, which makes me wonder: what if the Clippers announced plans to move to Seattle in 2014?

It took the Nets two years to move to Brooklyn and the it took the Thunder one to move to Oklahoma City. Steve Ballmer already offered $300 million to rebuild the KeyArena and if an agreement could be made, we could have opening night at the new Sonics Arena in time for the 50th anniversary of the Sonics being established. 

By the time 2017 rolls around, most of the current core is pretty much intact, barring the major free agent signings, but I foresee one major addition: Kevin Durant. He’s already said before he would love to play in Seattle again and I think he’d be a great fit alongside Lou Williams, Patrick Beverley, Montrezl Harrell, Danilo Gallinari and Blake Griffin.

1355,360,"Even if it were not in a trade for Anthony Davis, trading Lonzo Ball was an absolute necessity if the Laker wanted to compete for a championship","Lonzo is a strong defender and good passer in transition. But he would not have been able to help the Lakers win a championship and I doubt he could be effective past the first round.

To begin, Lonzo shot a paltry 41.7% from the free throw line. We've seen time and time again that playoff games often have close scores, which makes every free throw even more important. The Warriors won Game 5 and effectively lost Game 6 by two free throws. I believe playing him in the playoffs would only inspire teams to use a Hack-a-Zo strategy.

Second, Lonzo effectively can only shoot threes, which he makes at a subpar rate, 32.9% last season. His odd shooting form will make it difficult for him to shoot from the right wing and right corner when tightly guard. The best player in this past post-season were able to demonstrate versatililty with their scoring methods: shooting threes, layups, floaters and mid range shooting. His one dimensional scoring would have hindered the team, if LeBron and Anthony Davis were able to push the Lakers to the playoffs. They are both paint dominant players and need shooters around them to stretch the floor.

Third, while Lonzo is a great passer and playmaker in transition, he's not great at running half court sets and he  disappears in half court. While the playoffs are full of fast-paced plays in transitions, the moments where the offense slows down are also important. After the Warriors Game 4 loss, Stephen Curry noted that the Warriors needed to slow down the game, instead of speeding up their play to match the Raptors. I'm not convinced Lonzo has the control to do so deep in the playoffs when teams are vying for the championship. 

Every post-season we see the impact injuries can have on a team. The Warriors were the favorites to win the championship and viewed as an unbeatable foe but after several injuries to key players, the Warriors were only a shade of what they were expected to be and the Raptors overtook them. The fact that Lonzo has played a total of 99 games in the past two seasons does not bode well for his playoff performance. The Lakers couldn't take the risk of their starting point guard falling to injury before or during the playoffs and having the coaching staff scramble to build a new scheme with a new point guard.

This may be a reach but I'm open to objections and discussions but I don't believe that Lonzo has the mentality to succeed in the playoffs. This post season, the Nuggets and Trailblazers showed their grit by grinding through 4 over times. Draymond saved the Warriors from elimination in Game 5 leaping for a ball that was released so high, only a millimeter of his middle finger grazed the ball. Lonzo generally isn't aggressive in games. On the Shop, LeBron's ""talk show"", Lonzo said he didn't feel comfortable with the superstar until All Star weekend. He doesn't seem to have the mentality to face the pressure of the playoffs. 

I understand the trade must be tough for Lonzo. He dreamed of playing on the Lakers his whole life and when he was drafted, he was heralded as the successor to Magic Johnson. After the Lakers hired Jason Kidd, I'm sure he thought it was a good sign that he would be excluded from trade talks. But with the acquisition of LeBron and the abject failure of the past season, the Lakers have to switch into ""win-now"" mode while planning for the playoffs. I hope Lonzo can develop and become the player he's always wanted to be on his new team",nbadiscussion

- Miami represented a clear peak in efficiency. His final two years in Miami, in particular, were masterclasses of uber-efficient volume scoring: 38 points/100 possessions on *+10.7% efficiency*, Curry-esque. His final 2 Cleveland years (during both stints) were relative high points, too, averaging around a +6.5 during those 4 seasons. 

- LA-bron has been a relative low-point in efficiency, as while LeBron's own raw efficiency has only dipped slightly from his Cleveland years (61->58), the rest of the league has caught up, with league average TS% rising from an average of 54.6 during Bron's 2nd Cavs stint to 56.2 during his LA tenure.

- LeBron's scoring rate has remained remarkably consistent, with only a slight decline since peaking in 2009.

- LeBron's playmaking, on the other hand, has seen a clear upward trend throughout his career, with a clear spike in this past season with the addition of all-time-level rim target AD to the Lakers. Interestingly, stats like Ben Taylor's Passer Rating and Box Creation (which I unfortunately don't have access to) hold his Miami years in high esteem as well, even though he 'only' averaged 6.7 assists during his Heat tenure.

(Bonus: [advanced numbers](https://i.imgur.com/RIQD2e1.png))

- LeBron's 14-game long 2009 postseason run was a statistical masterpiece on all fronts, something of an outlier even for LeBron: all-time-great scoring rate (47.5 pts/100), elite efficiency (+7.4 rTS%), very good assist rate (39.5%), and, not indicated in the graph, career low turnovers (2.7). These factors all contributed to some stupidly dominant advanced numbers - 0.399 WS/48 (career playoff avg 0.244), 37.4 PER (career playoff avg 28.3), and, perhaps most incredibly, a 17.5 BPM (career playoff average 10.2). 

- 2014 once again featured some insanely efficient scoring from LeBron, this time in the postseason: 40 pts/100 on +12 rTS%. (This, following a regular season with a fantastic 38 pts/75, +10.8 rTS%.)

- Like in the regular season, LeBron's playoff scoring and assist rate took somewhat of a nosedive in Miami with his reduced load, but his advanced numbers were as strong as ever with the help of improved efficiency and team results (in terms of 3 year peaks, it's right up there with his two Cleveland stints, if not slightly higher due to his all-world defense in Miami)


- His final Cleveland stint (esp taking his final 3 years) has been very strong as well, putting up advanced metrics - WS/48 ~0.270, BPM ~11 - that only really Jordan and Kawhi have ever matched in the modern era - guys like young Duncan and 3-peat Shaq and Finals MVP Kobe and GS-KD have all had excellent showings, but their advanced numbers are slightly below those guys.

1358,363,Wilt Chamberlain lead the league in complaining about statistics with good reason in the 1960s,"Sports Illustrated - March 11, 1968

THE RECORD MAKERS

From time to time there are angry protests from NBA teams and players about the official scoring system in the league. It is decidedly bush, with home-town favouritism blatantly evident in the recording of individual statistics. The NBA Guide, for instance, lists 23 rebounding performances of 40 rebounds or more in a game. Just one of these records was made without the benefit of a home-town statistician. Similarly, only one of the top 36 assist marks was made on the road.

A classic scoring goof was made in a 76er-Bullet game two years ago when the official box score credited Gerry Ward with one field goal in no attempts (1 for 0). There was also the time that Hal Greer took six shots in a game and made seven of them, according to the stat men. And at half time in the All-Star game in January, Greer was credited with making two baskets but only taking one shot.

In a recent game in Evansville, Ind. between Chicago and St. Louis the official scorer recorded only three assists for the Hawks' Len Wilkens, who tops the league in that category. This led to immediate retribution when the Bulls visited St. Louis. At half time a Chicago official complained to Hawks General Manager Marty Blake that the Bulls' Jim Washington had been credited with only two rebounds. Blake replied, "" Washington will get another rebound when Wilkens gets an assist in Evansville.""

Currently, Wilt Chamberlain is leading the league in complaining about statistics, and probably with good reason. Philadelphia Statistician Harvey Pollack is one of the few well-regarded scorers in the NBA. He won't favour anyone, including Wilt, but he thinks Chamberlain probably has a valid complaint. To check for himself, Pollack decided two Sundays ago to keep his own box score as he watched the telecast of a game between the 76ers and the Hawks in St. Louis. The official statistics showed Wilkens with 13 assists and Chamberlain with four. Pollack, however, credited eight to Wilkens and nine to Chamberlain. ""I knew it was coming,"" Pollack said, ""because Chamberlain was catching Wilkens in total assists.""

http://www.nba.com/encyclopedia/pollack_wilt.html I went to a Boston-Warriors game in the Boston Garden and secretly kept track of the rebounds of both Wilt and Russell. When the game ended, I went to the press table and asked what the rebound totals were for Wilt and Russell. The response: ""Russell 35, Wilt 22."" My response, ""Well my totals are Wilt 34, Russell 21."" They sat open-mouthed when I produced my evidence of the time and type of every rebound that each player had. A Sports Illustrated writer nearby heard the conversation and asked me what it was all about. I told him and the next week SI had a story about the incident. Wilt and I chuckled on reading it, but Red Auerbach didn't. For many years thereafter he didn't talk to me, but how we were reconciled is another story that doesn't concern Wilt.

THE ASSAILABLE STATISTICAL

Doubling as press agent for the 76ers basketball team and as keeper of the team scores, Philadelphia Harvey Pollack is a two-portfolio man. Life for P.R. Man Pollack is fine; his team has come far this season. But life for Statistician Pollack is agonizing. He has the feeling that he is being rebounded.

Pollack is one of those basketball buffs caught up in the game-within-a-game drama being played at the moment between Wilt Chamberlain of the 76ers and Bill Russell of the Boston Celtics. Officially—or statistically, as they say in the National Basketball Association—Russell and Chamberlain are very close in their skill at getting the ball off the backboards—1,878 to 1,673 for the season. Unofficially, statistically or otherwise, this cannot be true, says Pollack, and he hopes to prove it.

In one recent game Boston scorekeeper, Dennis Whitmarsh counted 32 rebounds for Russell, 31 for Chamberlain. Pollack, at the same game, tallied it more like 18 for Russell and 30 for Chamberlain.

The dispute over which is the better backboard man is, of course, one of those arguments without end. What concerns us is that there should be such an argument at all. The trouble probably lies in the fact that each NBA team hires its own official scorekeeper, each subject to intense home-town pressures. Even so, the wide disparity in counts should properly puzzle fans. Doesn't one simply count the rebounds and leave it at that? The figures should not be Boston statistics or Philadelphia statistics but just plain, old, correct statistics.

American sports fans have long regarded official records as unassailable—a sort of fortress of agate type to which one could retreat when all else failed. That official records should differ dismays us. As an unofficial group, that is. Statistically speaking, of course.

To have those Wilt/Russell totals totally flipped is pretty fishy. on rebounds as They either go out of bounds, or somebody grabbed it. That should be pretty clear-cut. I don't see how they could get some of the discrepancies as listed above.

I guess this shows that the Boston scorekeepers cooked Russell's stats a bit.

It does change my perception of him as I'm fascinated by the rebound differential. between him and Wilt If it's true then Russell got a huge boost to his stats that has to make people look at him differently. I'm assuming those 10 block games of his didn't happen as often as people have said. I am thinking they did this as Russell was the hero of Boston. and they cant have him outplayed in Boston Garden so they did what they had to do to make sure Bill looked good against Wilt.",nbadiscussion
1359,364,Why Anthony Davis Might Not Be As Good As You Think,"This is something I noticed a while ago and have been meaning to post, and after seeing a relevant post here yesterday I decided to follow through.  This is a long post, so I'll start off with this:

 **TLDR - Anthony Davis relies heavily on other players setting him up for scoring looks, more so than pretty much any other top player (as evidenced by % of made 2-pt FG that are assisted).  This lack of shot creating ability may mean he is not quite as good as many people think.**

I'll preface this by saying that Anthony Davis is obviously a tremendously skilled player, and one of the best players in the NBA.  He is incredibly athletic for someone of his size, is a very good defender, has a better jumper than most big men, and has consistently put up an efficient 24+ points per game.  This is not a post made to hate on him; it's simply an explanation of why, in my opinion, he may not be as good as most people think.

For all of AD's obvious strengths, one important thing that I've noticed he's not elite at is creating his own shot.  Not that he can't do it, but I believe he relies on others to set him up to score more than other top players do.  This is evidenced by the fact that a large percentage of his made field goals are assisted, significantly more than other players of his caliber.

I did not use ""% of made 3-pt FG that are assisted,"" because (a) AD did not attempt very many 3PT field goals, and (b) for most players in the league (with the exception of players like Curry, Harden, Lillard, etc.), most of their made 3-pointers are assisted.

All data is from basketballreference.com.

|Career|950|.569|

As you can see, Anthony Davis' ""% of made 2-pt FG that are assisted"" is significantly higher than any of these players.  This is true when comparing him to pretty much any high scoring player that I haven't listed (just to name a few more: Giannis last year - 47.2%; Durant last year - 47.1%; Paul George last year - 31.1%).  I believe this shows that AD is not as good at creating his own scoring opportunities as other stars.

Now I could be wrong; there could be a legitimate explanation for this that I'm not thinking of.  Maybe this is because Davis is a great PnR man, because he's a lethal lob threat, or because he's a smart player who gets himself open a lot.  And this doesn't mean that Davis won't ever improve his ability to create his own scoring looks.  This past season was his lowest percentage yet (61.8%) by a significant margin, and other players listed were quite reliant on others to create looks for them early in their careers (Aldridge his first two seasons, Griffin his first 5 or 6 seasons).  But given how much higher AD's ""% of made 2-pt FG that are assisted"" is relative to other elite players, I think this possibly indicates that he's not as good of a shot creator as other stars, and that, IMO, means he may not be quite as good as many seem to think (i.e., top-5 player in the NBA).  

This is just one stat, though.  Anthony Davis is still an incredible talent, and is still a top-10 player in this league.  And even if this does mean he's not the greatest at creating clean scoring looks, that shouldn't matter too much next season when he's playing alongside LeBron James, arguably the greatest playmaker of all time.",nbadiscussion

Here's some of the stuff I've picked up over the last few years. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

* Tim Duncan has been more important to the Spurs franchise than David Robinson.
* There was a rather good player called Steve Nash who never won a title, and someone trading him away from some other guy called Dirk and back to the Suns is to blame for that.
* LeBron (I did hear of him) made a decision and it was a big deal.
* Hakeem Olajuwon and Dikembe Mutombo made decisions too, but it was just kinda sad.
* Literally no one talks about Shawn Kemp anymore.
* Plenty of people talk about Ray Allen though. I find this interesting.
* Damian Lillard is just as likeable, if not more, than Clyde Drexler was.
* Latrell Sprewell's career never really recovered from that choking thing.
* James Harden is ""the guard Karl Malone"".
* It's only because the league has moved from being a slow big man in the post-kinda game to a quick pick n roll three point-kinda game that Dwight Howard is regarded as a superstar.
* There was a guy called Elton Brand and another one called Yao Ming.
* People still prefer college Chris Webber to NBA Chris Webber.
* 1995 No.1 draft pick Joe Smith was traded A LOT.
* Career trajectory: Jason Kidd > Grant Hill, and I'm still trying to figure out how that happened.

1361,366,It feels like Marc Gasol landing on a finals contending team has been a very underrated storyline,"At 34 years old now and after struggling with some lingering injuries, it's fair to say there might be people out there who have written Marc Gasol off. In Memphis, Marc wasn't shy about voicing his concerns with the coaching staff and general direction the franchise was headed. 

Whether or not you think Gasol went about voicing his frustrations the right way, we aren't far removed from him being one of the first names you mention when talking about the best big men in the association. As someone who never relied on much athleticism in his prime to begin with, Marc should be capable of playing like his old self in spurts. 

I think with him being hungry for a chance to play in the finals and just playoff success in general, his play in the postseason could very well elevate the Raptors to another level. Marc's impact in the playoffs will definitely be worth watching for come spring time. ",nbadiscussion

1364,369,Chicago Bulls constant rebuilding and front office failures,"Understandably a large amount of focus on failed rebuilds and pathetic front office failures circulate around the New York Knicks however the Chicago Bulls are flying under the radar in our failure.

With today's loss to the Miami Heat we now have a full year of Jim Boylan as Bulls Head Coach to compare statistically. His record over these 82 games is 25 wins and 57 losses (.305).

Our previous head coach Fred Hoiberg who was fired and replaced by Boylan went 27-55 (.329) in his first year.

If you check the [historical record](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHI/) of Chicago Bulls statistics you can see that once Phil Jackson left after the 1998 finals victory the bulls have only had a handful of successful seasons over .500. and seven coaches.

Boylan is a TERRIBLE TERRIBLE coach. Check the final [possession](https://twitter.com/NBCSBulls/status/1203150641423630337?s=20) for our game against golden state. Zach was running an iso play as the clock ran down clearly ready to take the shot and Boylan called a time out... to then come back on court to run an iso play???  Obviously Zach shouldn't have waved off a screen when that was the shot he ended up with, but this is the level of confusion on the court at all times.

I honestly don't know where the bulls go from here, i swear that apart from maybe the knicks, Gar/Pax are one of the worst front offices in the league. They offered Boylan a contract extension even though the players mutinied against him... players like Zach publically call him out in interviews now etc.  I know it doesn't get much press because the shitty team focus is the Knicks and the other interest is mostly Western Conference but its bad.

Unless owner Jerry Reinsdorf suddenly decides to overhaul the front office I can't see how the bulls improve? We bring in talent just to squander or release them. its a mess.

I guess im just wondering where do you see the bulls going from here?

1366,371,Breaking down the Warriors' Curry-Green right-side PnR that won them G6,"*Outline:*

In the 4th quarter of G6, GSW went basic with a repetitive Steph Curry & Draymond Green right-side pick & roll. Yet they executed it with such clinical savagery - mixing in an array of counter-moves & variations that progressively torched everything Houston responded with. The Warriors rammed the near same action down Houston's throat **10 times** and came away with **20 crucial points** in what was probably the best Warriors' performance in a long time.

------------------

*Breakdown:*

[1. Curry Open Layup 2-pts](https://streamable.com/psobg)

CP3 on Curry; Tucker on Draymond. Draymond fakes a left screen coming in from behind CP3. CP3 is badly beaten as Curry simply drives left. It's reasonable that either CP3 was expecting Tucker to be in place to help on the drive or Houston was comfortable forcing Curry left on his injured hand (Curry's handles were sloppy up to this point in the game). GSW curls Klay up from the left corner to distract any potential Rockets help-D. Open lay-up

[2. Curry 3-pter](https://streamable.com/fqy86)

Gordon on Curry; Capela on Draymond. Draymond left screen; Houston switches. Capela who has played Curry tightly the entire game momentarily forgets about Curry's range and stays on the 3-pt line. Curry pulls up from almost 30ft. 

[3. Curry floater 2-pts](https://streamable.com/s1lbc)

Roughly a repeat of #1. However, this time the screen comes from up top and Paul should have clearly seen itcoming. Paul somehow anticipates a Curry pull-up, stupidly hops straight up and is badly beaten once again. With CP3 out of the way and no defender on his right hip, Curry finishes with a clean floater over Harden. 

[4. Green to Looney missed alley-oop](https://streamable.com/kdqku)

CP3 is now off and Rivers is on Curry; Tucker's still on Draymond. The warriors run the same action as before, but Houston now responds with Tucker showing/trapping on the left to prevent a Curry drive. Curry passes out of pressure to Draymond rolling to the rim. Looney can't finish the alley-oop as Harden is there to help off the Iguodala on the left-corner.

[5. Looney put-in 2-pts](https://streamable.com/x0wye)

Basically a rerun of #4, but this time there's a minor tweak. Iguodala isn't on the left corner anymore (Klay is) and Harden can't get in position to help (Gordon is occupied by Klay). Looney finishes the simple put-in after Draymond draws Capela off him.

[6. Curry 3-pter](https://streamable.com/cnd01)

CP3 is back in on Curry; Tucker on Draymond. This where things get pretty. By now, the Warriors can convincingly sell both Curry's drive left as well as Draymond rolling to the rim. Tucker shows to the left and Houston thinks it's going to be a replay of #4 & #5, but GSW throws in a killer counter: after Curry hits Draymond fake rolling, Draymond reverses the ball back to Curry for a 3-pter. Paul is completely befuddled by this, gets caught ball-watching, and loses track of Curry. 

[7. Green missed lay-up](https://streamable.com/g7133)

Houston now takes CP3 off Curry and put him on Klay; thus it's Gordon on Curry & Tucker on Draymond. What happens is a rough re-run of #4 & #5, but here CP3 is smart enough to switch Thompson off to Harden and seal off Looney so that Draymond can't dump the ball off to anyone and is forced to go up against Capela by himself (misses obviously).

[8. Curry lay-up 2pts](https://streamable.com/7d1cn)

Gordon on Curry; Tucker on Draymond. Now Houston will straight up force a switch to get Tucker on Curry by cheating, i.e. by linking arms or grabbing Draymond's waist to prevent him from rolling/slipping to the rim. But it's too late because Curry has heated up and Tucker is exhausted from having already accumulated 40 minutes. Tucker reaches; Curry teaches. Capela is too slow to react & help as Curry finishes an easy lay-up.

[9. Curry pull-up 3-pter](https://streamable.com/kg8pp)

Near the same as above. Curry dances with Tucker and drains a 3. 

[10. Drive and kick Klay 3-pter](https://streamable.com/6qny7)

Like #8 & #9, but with a GSW counter. Instead of accepting the switch this time, Curry attacks Gordon to the right just as Draymond appears to screen Gordon to the left. Curry then reverses back into Draymond's screen effectively force-converting Houston's attempt to switch into a trap. Curry finds Draymond rolling and it's effectively a replay of #4 except Draymond finds Iguodala in the corner who then swings it to Klay for a 3.

--------------------

*Additional notes:*

- Houston should have tried switching on Curry earlier. My feeling is that they greatly underestimated Curry after his cold first half, while overestimating the effect of Curry's injury had on him (hence sloppily letting him attack the basket). By running some tame PnR defence against Curry, they let him get going; before they realized the folly of it, he was fully warmed up. 

- Given the inattentiveness and poor defense by certain Rockets, it's reasonable to conjecture that Houston's watertight defense against Curry in the first half sapped their energy considerably; whereas Curry's foul trouble gave him relatively fresh legs during the 4th quarter.

- Paul was exposed during key junctures as he was [late in the last game](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/bmfsex/post_game_thread_the_golden_state_warriors_defeat/emwcm61/). At this point in his career, he only lives up to reputation as a savvy veteran defender on occasion and he can no longer be relied upon as a defensive stalwart (to the level of papering over his significant athletic disadvantage).",nbadiscussion
1367,372,Is Scoring STILL overrated in the 2020 NBA?,"NBA front offices are more about analytics, efficiency, and overall smarts than they have ever been.  Gone are the days of guys like Monta Ellis, Brandon Jennings,  Jordan Crawford, and the best of them all Carmelo Anthony  being considered exciting effective players.  Being able to score the ball isn't nearly as valued, anyone can score.  Now you must score efficiently.  However while teams may be smarter, this does not mean they are perfect.  Scoring somewhat efficiently has become the overrated skill.  

The best example of this in 2020 to me is Tobias Harris, a nice player on a 5 year 180 million dollar contract.  Universally reguarded as an overpay but many argued necessary, ""if philly does not max him, someone else will"", which may be true.  Tobias is not even remotely close to a max level player, but he became a 20 point scorer which is just as arbitrary as triple doubles, but the way our number system works, humans see the gap between 19 and 20 as much larger than 20 and 21.  Since becoming an effective perimeter shooter, Tobias has shot 4 3's a game on 37.5%, solid but largely unspectacular.  He shoots about 3 FTA, making a very solid 82%, scoring 17 points a night but more like 20 the last couple seasons.  This season, he takes less than half his shots from 3/at the rim.  The majority of his 2's are unassisted so he is going off the dribble himself to take floaters and mid range shots.  Tobias is a pretty bad defender, hidden with such excellence defense surrounding him, usually guarding a spot up guy.  Tobias is a somewhat high volume scorer, on decent efficiency who does not distribute, create his own offense especially well, or play much defense.

As a saber metrics baseball guy at heart, I love basketball advanced stats, but they are so behind as some of them are a poor indication of how good a player is.  I would argue Box plus minus is the best one, rating offense better than defense but both well nonetheless.  Out of 193 qualifiers, Tobias ranks 91st, middle of the road.  Offensively 81st, defensively 112th.  Max Kellerman's favorite stat, PER ranks Tobias at 16.8 this year, marginally above average.  The 4 names right in front of Tobias are Ricky Rubio,  Marquese Chriss, Maxi Kleber, and Tyus Jones.  VORP sees him more kindly in 62nd, just behind Will Barton.

I will not repeat the arguments all over again but almost everything said about Tobias can be applied to CJ McCollum and the 5 year 157 million dollar deal he has.  He scores somewhat efficiently but does essentially nothing else well.  Buddy Hield and Julius Randle work here as well.

Scoring is still the most important skill in the NBA and probably always will be.   But 2020 basketball is more about versatility than efficiency.  Versatility is the ultimate form of efficiency.  Giannis provides a number one scoring option, a good secondary playmaker, a good ball handler, fantastic rebounder, and defensive anchor all in 1 player.  It is why I believe Ben Simmons is the most underrated player in the NBA as he does so many things at an elite level.  If you hate him for not shooting 3's Simmons attacks the rim and distributes to shooters so much he creates more 3's than a guy like Eric Gordon who shoots a million.  He is top 20 in BPM; guys like Deandre Jordan, Delon Wright, and Daniel Theis are all top 40 due to defensive contributions. 

 If a scorer is to be valuable as a scorer and nothing else, his efficiency must be incredible, like a Karl Anthony Towns and his 64 TS%.  And as incredible as he is, his team has been awful with him as its best player.  A top player can score many points and do so efficiently, but it is difficult to lead to winning unless you can also do a couple of other elite skills.",nbadiscussion
1368,373,The Miami Heats over/under will be easy money: Why the Heat are more underrated and misunderstood than you think.,"  \# Intro

The Miami Heat line, according to oddsshark and most other websites sits at \[43.5\])[https://www.oddsshark.com/nba/nba-season-win-totals-betting-odds](https://www.oddsshark.com/nba/nba-season-win-totals-betting-odds)), and based on my own observation from frequently browsing [r/nba](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/) most people would consider us to range from 40-42 wins. Some even questioning if we are a playoff team. I’m going to preface this by saying that I don’t mean to sound hostile or condescending, but this take is laughable and shows how many people haven’t paid any attention to anything other than our record from last year. I don’t expect anyone outside of Heat fans that have watched us the past few seasons to really understand anything at all about this team, because this is not your typical fringe playoff team. So I hope this post will clear the air, and bring the light on some of the misconceptions about the potential of this team. This won’t be super analytical, but it will be long.

\# The Heats 2018-2019 season is not an accurate reflection of what the team really is

People look at the 39-43 record from last year’s campaign and try to apply that to next season. The truth is that that record was influenced by a lot factors that have either gone away or mended themselves. In fact 39 wins is pretty amazing all things considered.

1. Goran Dragic only played 36 games last year, all of those either injured or recovering. Having Dragic healthy, which he is now, would have probably led to 2 or 3 more wins.

2. One of the worst takes regarding our team that I have seen mentioned somewhat frequently is that we got worse because Wade left. Wade deserves everything in the world and I’m not saying I’m mad because of last season, but Wade lost us so many games. If any game was close going into the 4th quarter we let Wade play hero ball (deservedly so) and shot us out of most games. Wade was not a positive on the court in most games, and him retiring is our 2nd biggest example of addition by subtraction.

3. Our biggest example of addition by subtraction is dropping Hassan Whiteside. Not much to be said about him here, because his problems are well documented [r/nba](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/). One thing I do want to clear up though is that he did not quit after getting his contract. In fact he had his best season the year after getting his contract, along with massively improving his defense. It wasn’t about the money, it’s just his fragile ego, attitude, and archaic style of play became a bigger and bigger problem.

4. The Heat finished \[dead last\]([https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/stat/free-throw-pct](https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/stat/free-throw-pct)) in free throw percentage last year, mainly due to a career low from Whiteside who dropped from a 70% ft shooter to a 44% ft shooter last season. This cost us a lot of games obviously, but with our roster changes we have shot \[extremely better\]([https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/preseason/team/Miami-Heat/15/stats/2020/Totals/All/points/All/desc/1/Preseason](https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/preseason/team/Miami-Heat/15/stats/2020/Totals/All/points/All/desc/1/Preseason)) although it is a small sample size.

\# Some surprising facts that separate the Heat from other Eastern Conference teams in their range.

Miami had the \[12th\]([https://www.basketballreference.com/leagues/NBA\_2019\_standings.html](https://www.basketballreference.com/leagues/NBA_2019_standings.html)) best road record in the league. Better than the Pacers or Nets. In fact they tied with the Philadelphia 76s and the Denver Nuggets. Furthering the point, there was only a 1 game difference from the Boston Celtics, Utah Jazz, and Portland Trailblazers. And only a 2 game difference from the LA Clippers, Houston Rockets, and OKC. Only Toronto, Golden State and Bucks had a bigger difference. At the same time we also had the 24th worst home record, up there among some of the worst teams in the NBA. My theory is that we let Wade play more at home for the fans, therefore losing us way more home games. Let’s compare that to other Eastern Conference teams that finished in the same range as the Heat. The Nets and Pacers finished 19-22, the Magic 17-24, the Pistons 15-26, and the Hornets at 14-27. What’s even crazier is that the Heat had the best road record among teams that won 40-49 games, with the only exception the Clippers and Thunder. Pretty good for a 39 win team. The point here is that our road record is more indicative of how good the Miami Heat are, because Wade wasn’t that much of an issue.

This is the craziest stat in my opinion. The Miami Heat also had the 12th best record against the West. That not might sound that amazing until you realize that is also counting Western team’s record against other Western teams. The Miami Heat had the 4th best record in the East Conference when playing against the West, trailing only the Raptors, Bucks, and Sixers. The Miami Heat record against the west at 16-14 blows out any other team that finished within our range. The only teams that were close were the Pacers at 15-15, and the Celtics and Pistons tied at 14-16. The Magic finished 12-18, the Nets finished 13-17 and the Hornets finished 10-20. Again this points to Wade’s negative impact on away games, and our excellent coaching staff.

\# We have only seen this team be somewhat healthy twice

In 2016-2017 we went 25-6, with a 13 game winning streak after a putrid 11-30 start. And in 2017-2018 we won 44 games, although we suffered injuries near the end of the season. I don’t know where to find the stat, but the Heat were among the top of the league in games missed due to injury last season.

\# Our strong bench just got stronger

I don't know where to find our bench stats, but our bench was extremely valuable last year, usually killing other teams second units. This was without Dion and Dragic. This season our starting lineup will most likely be Winslow/Herro or Dion/Butler/Bam/ Meyers. That means we have a bench unit consisting of Dragic/Dion or Herro/James Johnson/Derrick Jones J[r/Kelly](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kelly/) Olynyk (at least until he fully heals). In terms of second units that is elite offensively as well as above average defensively, our main strengths last year was depth and we got deeper.

\# Development of Youth

Another really underrated and misunderstood player is Winslow, who took a massive leap and was our best player last season after Dragic opted for knee surgery. I won’t go over him because that in of its self could be a whole post. Bam is also set for a big leap, with Whiteside out of the way he can finally play unimpeded. Tyler Herro looks like the 2nd best player out of the draft when looking at Summer League and the Preseason, but I’m not going to overreact. At the very least he will be a good spot up shooter and floor spacer for the team. Another player who has emerged as a great role player is Derrick Jones Jr, mostly known for his dunks but also plays great defense and is very skilled offensive rebounder due to his athleticism. He is only 21, and while no one expects him to be star he is shaping up to be a top tier role-player that can energize the team with a highlight play.

\# The Final and Most Important Point.

In addition to all the other points I made we added fucking Jimmy Butler, a top 12-15 player to an already elite top 6 defense but terrible offensive team. Our biggest problem was scoring, and we dropped Whiteside and Wade and added Jimmy and Herro, with Dragic and Dion coming back. We didn’t even lose anything since he was basically traded straight up for Josh Richardson. Saying we are barely a playoff team or only marginally better than last season is incredibly wrong. Again I don’t want to sound like a homer that shits on other teams (which is unavoidable with this ending rant) but thinking the Pistons or Magic are better, despite only winning a few more games than us last season, despite not making any significant roster changes is just ignorant.

TL;DR

The Heat are way better than you think. We have elite a elite road record and record against the west. Outside of Orlando no other team that finished in our range doesn't have the kind of developing young core that we have. We added Jimmy Butler on top of all that",nbadiscussion
1369,374,"[OC] Visualizing Player Value, and the Insane Value of Rookie Contracts","Great teams benefit from employing players who vastly outperform their contracts. This past season, Pascal Siakam emerged as the champion Raptors' second-best player at times, while being paid in the 12th percentile of all NBA players. Stephen Curry's ankle issues led him to be famously underpaid during his MVP seasons and set the stage for his Warriors' mid-2010s dominance. You could make a convincing argument that LeBron James has been worth far more than his max contract for his on-court contributions alone.

&nbsp;

On the flip side, bloated contracts given to underperforming stars or even middling role players can severely restrict the flexibility and ultimately the success of their teams. All Wolves' owner Glen Taylor needed to see from Andrew Wiggins before handing him a max contract was a handful of subpar chucking seasons and an (unfulfilled) [promise that he would improve](https://sports.yahoo.com/timberwolves-just-want-andrew-wiggins-promise-hell-get-better-200047839.html). Wiggins' ill-advised contract contributed to the downfall of the Wolves' short-lived return to relevance in 2018, and may eventually cost them the opportunity to retain Karl-Anthony Towns.

&nbsp;

I mean, this a pretty straightforward concept - acquire high-value players and avoid having overpaid players on the roster. But is there anything more to this strategy that we can uncover? Are there certain types of players that tend to exist under the radar? What exactly constitutes a ""high-value"" player?

#Salary Scores and VORP Scores

My working definition of value is production in relation to salary. For two players with a given level of production, the player who is paid less than the other has more value. But how should we measure salary and production?

In order to form an effective basis for comparison across seasons, we need to scale salaries relative to each season. Otherwise a max contract from a decade ago would look like insane value compared to a similar size contract today. Case in point: Kobe Bryant in 2005 made $14.1 million. A similar salary today would net you players like Kelly Oubre, Marvin Williams, or Eric Gordon.

In addition to salary, we need a production metric. I chose VORP for the job given that it has a decent reputation as advanced metrics go and is widely available in Basketball Reference for the scope of this study. Because VORP is calculated to be era-independent, I scaled VORP relative to all seasons (2003-2019).

To compute both Salary Score and VORP Score, I rescaled the original variables such that the means have a value of 0 and the standard deviations have a value of 1.

I went as far back as 2003, when the NBA introduced the modern salary cap and luxury tax system that remains in place today. Before 2003 you had contracts exceeding the entire cap - but with different luxury tax incentives, teams and players behaved differently. 

&nbsp;

So with these rescaled tools, we can plot all players from 2003-2019 on [one chart](https://i.imgur.com/75AvJmx.png).

&nbsp;

We can begin to tease out an idea of value from this chart: remember that a positive Salary Score represents a salary above league average for that season, while a positive VORP Score represents a VORP above league average for the entirety of the 2003-2019 seasons. Thus, a player with a positive salary score and a negative VORP score can be identified as having poor value, and the opposite for a player with great value.

It gets a little murkier around the middle portion of the plot, where salary score and VORP score are similar. Just how valuable is a player that is paid highly yet falls slightly short in terms of production? How about a player that is paid slightly above average but produces well above average? There exists a delicate balance between the value of cap space and the rarity of big-time contributors - where exactly does the equilibrium fall?

A great many players are scrunched into that bottom left corner - that means they're below average in both salary and production. These players aren't difference makers on the court, nor on the team's books, so their value doesn't move the needle.

So we visually laid out players in a way that we can tease out some assumptions about value. But we need to more explicitly define this idea of *value*.

#Adding a Value Gradient

The tricky part in defining value is finding the balance in valuing production as magnitude of contract increases. The value of VORP does not progress at a one-to-one rate with salary - higher production players are increasingly rare and should be compensated accordingly. A player with a VORP of 5.0 should be worth more than two players each with a VORP of 2.5.

At the same time, cap space itself is highly valued, and a player taking up large amounts of cap room while not living up to their contract acts as a deadweight to a team that is now severely handicapped in building out the rest of the roster.

To come up with my Value Score, I created an expected salary for each player based on their VORP for that season. Then I subtracted the player's actual salary from their expected salary to get the first component of the Value Score. Then, in order to account for the rarity of higher production players, I added VORP Score as a second component to the Value Score. The end result, besides the ability to quantifiably rank player value, is [this value gradient](https://i.imgur.com/z5HnHXa.png).

&nbsp;

The diagonal line represents the ""break-even curve"" where value score is calculated to be zero - players above and to the left are of below-average value, and players below and to the right of the curve are of above-average value.

The graph above confirms our intuitions about where the high and low value players reside, also giving us some clarity in the murky middle region of the graph.

Time to put it to use!

|Brandon Roy|2009|24|3|POR|$3.1m|5.7|5.36|

&nbsp;

11 out of the 20 seasons are from budding young stars still on their rookie contracts. Andrei Kirilenko was an absolute beast in 2004, finishing second in VORP while earning a meager million. 

The non-rookie contract seasons come from: LeBron James - no further explanation needed; Steph Curry - whose aforementioned ankle issues suppressed his value until he blossomed into an all-time great; and a handful of superstars at the absolute peak of their game - 2003 McGrady, 2005 Garnett, and 2009 Wade. 

&nbsp;

**Top 20 most overvalued seasons since 2003:**

|Keith Van Horn|2006|30|9|DAL|$15.7m|0.1|-4.04|

&nbsp;

The tail end of the value spectrum is populated almost exclusively by aging stars struggling with injury and ineffectiveness while still being paid handsomely  - 17 out of the 20 players listed here are in their 10th season or later. Derrick Rose's third comeback effort in as many seasons (after as many knee surgeries...) makes the cut. And then you have... Andrew Wiggins.

[Here is a visualization of the above tables](https://i.imgur.com/v7ScZZO.png), overlayed onto the value gradient.

&nbsp;

For a more recent flavor, let's take a look at the **most undervalued players from this past season (2019):**

|player|age|season number|team|sal|vorp|value score|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Karl-Anthony Towns|23|4|MIN|$7.8m|5.7|4.82|
|James Harden|29|10|HOU|$30.4m|9.9|4.72|
|Giannis Antetokounmpo|24|6|MIL|$24.2m|7.6|4.13|
|Nikola Jokic|23|4|DEN|$24.6m|7.3|3.83|
|Nikola Vucevic|28|8|ORL|$12.8m|5.3|3.7|
|Pascal Siakam|24|3|TOR|$1.5m|3.5|3.48|
|Ben Simmons|22|2|PHI|$6.4m|4.1|3.4|
|Luka Doncic|19|1|DAL|$6.6m|3.6|2.85|
|Rudy Gobert|26|6|UTA|$23.2m|5.9|2.75|
|Montrezl Harrell|25|4|LAC|$6.0m|3.4|2.73|


&nbsp;

Again - 4 out of 10 players still on their rookie contracts. The rest? Giannis and Harden finished 1st and 2nd in MVP voting, respectfully; Vucevic had a career year on a very team-friendly salary; and Gobert's fourth-place finish in VORP lives up to his lofty salary, a scenario that Value Score (ahem) values highly.

Nikola Jokic, despite being in his fourth year, was not on his rookie deal due to the fact that he was a second-round pick. Second-rounders aren't subject to the same salary structure as first-rounders. He is still totally worth every dollar of that contract though.

&nbsp;

**And now for underperformers in 2019:**

|player|age|season number|team|sal|vorp|value score|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Andrew Wiggins|23|5|MIN|$25.5m|-0.6|-4.12|
|Harrison Barnes|26|7|DAL/SAC|$24.1m|-0.2|-3.58|
|Gordon Hayward|28|8|BOS|$31.2m|1.2|-3.28|
|Jabari Parker|23|5|CHI/WAS|$20.0m|0.0|-2.79|
|Jeff Teague|30|10|MIN|$19.0m|-0.1|-2.73|
|Otto Porter|25|6|WAS/CHI|$26.0m|1.0|-2.71|
|Chris Paul|33|14|HOU|$35.7m|2.4|-2.69|
|Dennis Schroder|25|6|OKC|$15.5m|-0.6|-2.66|
|Allen Crabbe|26|6|BRK|$18.5m|-0.1|-2.65|
|Kent Bazemore|29|7|ATL|$18.1m|-0.1|-2.59|

&nbsp;

Would you look at that - Wiggins takes the cake for most overvalued player of the 2018-19 season. And on the other end of the spectrum? His teammate, Karl-Anthony Towns. 

[For your visual reference:](https://i.imgur.com/Bel2GVx.png)

&nbsp;

[Here's a link to the full value dataset.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1szjxw6ZJYjsIKnddoDmr-_bRAZFt6gz1/view?usp=sharing)

There seems to be a trend we're noticing here, which leads us to...

#The Value of Rookie Contracts

The NBA introduced rookie scale contracts in 1995 in response to the growing number of absurdly large deals given to young, unproven rookies. The structure of these rookie contracts allows teams to retain their first-rounders for up to 4 seasons at a predetermined rate depending on their draft position.

Given the amount of uncertainty involved with projecting future success at such a young age, the structure makes a lot of sense. For the rookies, it represents guaranteed money upon being drafted, their first taste of (monetary) success. But for the standouts - those who enter the league as positive contributors, or become one after a season or two - this contract structure serves to artificially depress their salary, and thus lead to incredible value for their team. 

[Check out this visual](https://i.imgur.com/Tzz8gK8.png) which charts player salary against season number.

&nbsp;

As the graphic above depicts, players in their first 4 seasons are vastly over-represented in the lower 50 percentile of salaries, which immediately shifts from season 5 on, when many rookie-scale contracts end. But does player production follow a similar progression?

&nbsp;

[Not at all.](https://i.imgur.com/0ZjQuWg.png) By their third seasons, players' VORPs start to closely resemble those of more experienced players. This means that some of the most valuable contracts in the league, on a season-by-season basis, tend to be players in their third or fourth seasons. 


[This graphic](https://i.imgur.com/nvr2455.png) charts Salary Score by VORP Score, but separates players' seasons by season number.

&nbsp;

[Here's all of them squashed into one graph](https://i.imgur.com/pEsDpIL.png) for a different look. Blue points represent players in their first four seasons, while red points denote players in their fifth seasons and on.

Note the solid value growth throughout the first four seasons, underscored by the dramatic shift from season four to season five.

As an aside: The goal here is not to uncover some hidden strategy - it's no secret that players who develop into positive contributors while still on their rookie-scale contracts get the most bang for their buck. Nevertheless, I think visualizing the scope of their value in comparison to more experienced players is pretty striking. 

#Bottom Line: Young Players Who Pan Out are Insanely Valuable.

...Until they sign their second contract, that is. Teams that hold the rights to the player hold a distinct advantage over others when it comes to retaining that player in terms of total salary and years offered. Valuing that contract, however, is especially tricky, as teams have to take into account future growth and injury risk, evaluate the player's fit and role within the team, and fight off other potential suitors. But before they sign that second contract...

&nbsp;

Their value multiplies two-fold when you consider the cap flexibility retained by the team. Not only does the team reap the benefits of outsized productivity from a young, underpaid player, but they also maintain the wiggle room to acquire and keep additional talent.

&nbsp;

If team like the Sixers manages to acquire a Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, two star-level players still on their rookie contracts, it leaves them with ample cap space to sign another star in Horford and put together a cast of high-level supporting players. The Sixers may face a troubling cap scenario when Embiid and Simmons' extensions both kick in, but for now they remain one of the favorites to come out of the East.

&nbsp;

These results only magnify the importance of identifying and acquiring young talent. If a team can create a competitive advantage through the draft and hit on more draft picks than average, they can reap the benefits of their inflated value. Easier said than done, of course, but teams like the San Antonio Spurs have shown a consistent edge in finding talented young players later in the draft, which is a large component of their continued success.

#Next Steps

I ran into a few problems during the course of this project that need a little working around. Only players with over 800 minutes played on the season are included in the dataset, which leaves out some players on albatross contracts that sat out the entire season (Chandler Parsons comes to mind, also John Wall for this upcoming season) and the exclusion of which could skew the data.

&nbsp;

Leaving out such players also distorts the uncertainty of relying on young, unproven kids. One assumed advantage of signing experienced players is that they are more of a known commodity, and that lesser risk factors into their monetary value. Expecting a draft pick to be a positive contributor out the gate for a world-class, professional sports team may be asking a little too much of a 19-year-old who would otherwise be in his sophomore year of college. Nevertheless, some players figure it out much quicker than others, some peak early and fizzle out, some never figure it out at all - the point is that you just don't know, and it's incredibly difficult to predict.

For these reasons, I plan to replicate this project including all players with no minutes cutoff.

&nbsp;

There is also much more nuance in team-specific situations than this study suggests. Each team is on their own timeline in terms of competing, player development, owner outlook, market situation, and overall direction that is almost entirely overlooked here. Sometimes teams are forced to overpay key players or risk letting them walk for nothing in free agency. The free agent market often boils down to a take-what-you-can-get scenario for many teams - acquiring a certain player may be viewed as an overpay by the numbers and from the lens of outside observers, but in actuality represents a necessary step for a team to continue to improve.

&nbsp;

Contracts also don't exist in a seasonal vacuum, and represent more than just compensation for on-court production. Teams may be willing to overpay aging stars in order to contend in the present (eg. Chris Paul and the Rockets). Expiring contracts represent strategic, roster-building value distinct from the on-court production of the players to which they are attached. The magnitude of contracts reflects the state of the free agency market around the time of the signing; weak markets lead to a negative feedback loop and overpaying players, as [John Hollinger points out in his Athletic article](https://theathletic.com/1312762/2019/10/22/hollinger-how-next-summers-weak-free-agency-class-impacted-nba-contract-extension-deadline/).

&nbsp;

The way in which we perceive contract value is flawed, too. Postseason success is too often the focal point through which we judge front office and coaching decisions, which may serve to create a revisionist timeline more often than not. While signing a player can be seen as a safe gamble at the time, perception of the deal can quickly sour if that roll of the dice turns out unfavorably due to injury or other misfortune.

&nbsp;

However, the goal was never to come up with an approach that accounts for all of the above and churns out a one-size-fits-all solution. The objective, rather, is much less ambitious. It is simply to add another tool to our belt - one that helps us shine more light on a specific component of the problem, that we can use in conjunction with other contextual clues to evaluate each situation. The results of this project provide a quantifiable addition to any discussion about a player's value.

#Which Teams Capitalize Most on this Value?

Earlier I touched on the importance of acquiring underpaid talent, given its extraordinary value. An interesting next step would be to look at the teams who have excelled in this department and whether they've employed any unique strategies in doing so.

&nbsp;

Front offices have many avenues through which to improve their rosters, whether it be through the draft, free agency, trades, or internal development. Teams located in larger, more attractive markets can lean on free agency as a bigger tool in roster building, whereas other teams must survive through calculated trades and developing their own talent. The latter category includes teams like the Spurs, Nets, Blazers and Heat which have relied on building a strong culture of professionalism and player development.

Hey everyone - this is a quick 3.5 minute update on Orlando Magic Jonathan Isaac’s left knee ACL rupture, what may have caused it, the typical return timeline, and potential career impact. Thanks to the mods for letting me post.

Here’s a table of contents, header (sub headers):

Summary: Isaac ruptured the ACL in his left knee in the 4th quarter vs the Kings during a jump stop in the lane, with his knee dropping into non-contact knee valgus on an externally rotated foot. This is the most common mechanism for injury. In the video, I went into potential root causes such as inherent risk when ramping up after injury and neuromuscular deficits, the average return timeline which is about 9.5 months for NBA players, and how his sequence of knee injuries in short succession may impact his career due to reinjury risk, compensatory risk, long term deficits, and mental challenges (specifically kinesiophobia)

1371,376,"Why is the NBA fanbase so young? Why did the people who were fans when Micheal Jordan, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Dr. J, Kareem etc. stop watching the NBA?","A common talking point is the how the NBA is the sport of the youth and how it's fanbase is super young compared  to the NFL and MLB.

Let's assume this is a fact, why is this the case?

I'll explore some possible reasons and give my opinion on them

1. The NBA was formed after the NFL and MLB. 

This is a fact, the NBA started in 1946 while the NFL started in 1918 and MLB started before 1900. All leagues had predecessor leagues. The theory here is that the NBA wasn't really a big deal until Michael Jordan (let's say 1988) so older fans grew up before the NBA was a big deal. 

This might have some validity but I think it's kinda a cop out. First, the NBA was popular when guys like Kareem and Wilt played. No idea why reddit thinks otherwise. Second, Magic and Bird made it super popular in the early 1980s. That was 40 years ago, so anyone under 50 grew up with the NBA being super popular. Not to mention the NBA feels less popular today, in America, than it was in the 1990s. 

Are the people who were fans of Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Kareem etc. not fans anymore?

2. Too many 3 pointers/not enough defense

You can throw in other complaints about style of play including decline of the big man but those two are the most prevalent. To many, the NBA feels like a 3 point contest with some dribbling. I don't think this is valid because the NFL is as popular as ever and they play a different style of football as they used to.

3. Players are too friendly with each other

This theory is that players are all buddy buddy and fans realize that. They know that guys care more about maintaining friendships than winning. I think this exists in football so I don't buy it.

4. Load Management

Self explanatory. And it's a legit reason. I bet older generations look down on the modern NBA player because the only reason the NBA is popular/profitable enough to allow load management is on the backs of their predecessors. If Kareem or Wilt load managed, the NBA might have died. 

5. The league is driven by social media

This theory is that the NBA has tailored itself to the twitter crowd. It's about drama, free agency etc. 

I personally think this is the main reason. The NBA realized that they'll never beat the NFL in TV ratings but they can beat them in social media. The NBA is the only sports league where its offseason has more buzz than it's regular season. Free Agency is the second biggest time of the NBA calender (finals are most) and free agency is more impactful than most of the playoffs. It's frankly sad

So what do you think is the reason the NBA lost the MJ, Magic, Bird, Kareem etc. generations of fans? Or do you think those people still watch the league?",nbadiscussion
1372,377,Do you think that LeBron is still the best in the NBA? Would like to hear some opinions from this sub as my friends IRL are pretty torn about this.,"[Here is a group poll I made to see who others think is top dog at the moment.](https://linkto.run/p/C9RPYCEO)

So we have a number of different guys at the moment who have a claim as the best player in the NBA. More so then in recent years at least. So naturally this a question that must be asked a lot due to this, and I apologize for asked it again.

Personally, until I see it with my own eyes, nobody in the league is as clutch as LeBron Jamed is in the playoffs. That's why I would still place him at the top.

So, what do you guys think?",nbadiscussion
1373,378,Would the Lakers rather face Rockets or OKC in the next round?,"Saw one about the Clippers next round which was interesting and wanted to see what you guys thought about these potential matchups. I would think that most people would say rockets but both teams are solid and can make it tough for the Lakers.

Its been an interesting series so far with the Rockets vs OKC heading to a game 7. The two teams are quite different and Lakers game plan would be quite different for each of them, so which of the two teams is most likely to push the Lakers more or maybe even cause an upset in the western conference semifinals.",nbadiscussion
1374,379,The max contract doesn't get nearly enough credit for facilitating Kawhi's off-season moves,"The contract maximum is a price ceiling, and economic theory suggests some predictable effects from it. The first is shortages - if more people want to buy something at the capped price than there are things to sell, then people are going to have to go home empty-handed. This was in full swing during Kawhi's free agency, where at least three teams were keeping cap space open to sign him. There was only one free agent of his caliber available, so the teams could not credibly threaten to sign someone else because there's nobody else to sign. The negotiation position for Kawhi was incredibly lopsided in Kawhi's favor because of the contract max, which allowed him to demand the Paul George trade.

Another major effect of price caps is search costs. The short summary of this is that if you aren't allowed to pay with money, you pay with something else. Usually this is time - back when Nixon instituted price controls on gasoline, the predictable result was massive lines and waiting. For the Lakers, this was putting up with the slow pace of negotiations and letting Kawhi use them as leverage in the hope that they actually got the signing. The Clippers, on the other hand, paid a premium through making the trade he demanded. There were other details of this that you could see throughout the process, where teams would tout the non-monetary differentiators that they could conceive of in an attempt to be more attractive without raising salary.

A more basic point here is that every NBA player with multiple max-contract offers is underpaid. If there wasn't a rule against it, they'd be able to get a team to happily offer them more money. This is a big source of leverage for free agents in this situation, since they can shop around this windfall to multiple teams and see what they're willing to do to get it.

tl;dr - if Kawhi was allowed to sign for significantly more money, he would have done that instead of making the Clippers trade for Paul George. But he can't make any more money through his playing contract, so he has to settle for non-financial compensation in the form of team composition.",nbadiscussion
1375,380,"With the Memphis Grizzlies entering offseason, what should they do to continue to improve and build around Ja and JJJ?","The Grizzlies need to improve on both their SG and SF positions, but I’d be hesitant to make any moves yet. The players at those positions are still young and could develop a lot more over the next couple of years. Dillon Brooks and Justise Winslow have the potential to develop into really solid players but they might not pan out. DeAnthony Melton and Grayson Allen have also performed well this season so they could heavily factor into the rotation. Another question is whether or not Jaren should play center or stay at the PF position. This also begs the question of how high Brandon Clarke’s ceiling is and whether he is fit to play a high level of minutes. Beyond filling these positional needs, do the Grizzlies need a third star beyond Ja and Jaren? Are Ja and Jaren enough to carry the Grizzlies to be a top 5 team in the west within the next 5 years?

I’d really love to hear all of your thoughts on trade ideas, signings, observations, and any other opinions you have on the Grizzlies.",nbadiscussion
1376,381,A couple of moves from Zion that impressed me today because he executed them just like Hakeem Olajuwon did.,"I've been watching Hakeem Olajuwon quite obsessively recently and I felt Zion took a couple of pages out of Hakeem's book today:

1. He moves before the defender realizes. [Here](https://youtu.be/T2uJwx2KCwo?t=125), Whiteside is waiting for Zion to catch, set and then move. But Zion begins his move before he catches and gets around Whiteside before he realizes. This leads to a foul. ^(A foul is a bucket)   
Hakeem explains [here](https://youtu.be/dkxFtT0GUP0?t=70) how to use this move effectively and I loved how Zion executed it today.
2. His low-sweep, fake combination to get into the paint was elite. [Here](https://youtu.be/T2uJwx2KCwo?t=113), Ariza knows that Zion is lethal in the pain if he gets a free left-handed layup so he tries to block that path.  Zion catches the ball, does a low swipe, one bounce and he's in the paint. The fake sells the defender because that's his strongest area but the smoothness of the move sends him unguarded into the paint where he elevated and destroyed the rim.   
Once again, what better way to learn than to look at one of the best post players of all time. [Hakeem did the same thing](https://youtu.be/22O2lApCBBs?t=88) but to the opposite side. Hakeem's favorite side was the right so he sweeps, fakes, and gets into the paint from the left.

Overall, I think he can get plenty of buckets just due to his athleticism, but I feel that this knowledge of the game and ability to execute is what will set him apart in the years to come.

1378,383,Isiah Thomas is not underrated.,"Since the Jordan docs started to air, one thing I've definitely noticed was the increased level of praise being thrown Isiah Thomas' way. It seems like everyone is saying that Thomas is slept on, underrated, and just an amazing basketball talent. While I agree with the last point, I disagree with the first two. See, people have told me they think Thomas is underrated, to which I ask them where they believe Thomas should be ranked, and almost every time, they say somewhere in the 30's or late 20's all time. Here's some news: Pretty much everyone has Thomas somewhere from 25-40 on their all-time list, meaning that if you think Thomas is underrated, you would have to think he's top 25 all-time, and I don't think you can make a sound argument to support putting him in your top 25 all-time list.

# Scoring

An argument that I've seen more and more frequently is about his scoring, in that ""if he wanted to, he could've scored much more than 19 points per game."" Hard disagree. Thomas was, in a word, inefficient. He shot 45% from the field, which doesn't seem too bad, but he was a 29% 3 point shooter and a poor free throw shooter for a point guard. True shooting is a much more effective measure of a player's efficiency, and Thomas' TS% was 51.6%. In case you don't know, that's real bad. Let's put that into perspective. The league average TS% from the 1982 season until the 1994 season was 53.7%, meaning that Thomas shot 2.1% below league-average. Another player who is considered inefficient (for good reason) is Jason Kidd. The league average TS% from 1995 to 2013 was 53.1%, and Jason Kidd's 50.7% TS was 2.4% below league-average. So Thomas scored 19 points per game, which is good, but it was on Jason Kidd level efficiency. Sure, he could've decided to score more and pass less if he wanted to, but in that case, he would've been considered a small, inefficient scorer, and therefore would've been played less, so he wouldn't have enough time to score more than 19 a game.

# Passing

Thomas was obviously a great passer, and while I don't particularly see people overrating his passing ability, it should be said that he's not without his flaws. He averaged a career 9.3 assists per game, which is like, really good. However, he also averaged 3.8 turnovers. The only players who have more turnovers per game than him in their career are Magic Johnson, Russell Westbrook, and John Wall. You could say his high turnover numbers are due to his high assist numbers, but his assist to turnover ratio is not great, at just 2.46. This mark is significantly lower than the A/TO of game's greatest passers, such as Magic Johnson (2.89), John Stockton (3.72), Jason Kidd (3.02), Steve Nash (2.97), and Chris Paul (3.94). You also have to watch some of the film if you want to make valid statements about players, and that I did. I didn't really notice him making advanced or creative passes as often as the aforementioned passing greats, and a lot of his assists were more a product of his outstanding teammates than his own passing. Overall, I'd still categorize Isiah Thomas as a great passer, but he's not on the same tier as players like Magic, Nash, Kidd, and CP3.

# Defense

Thomas' defensive ability is also something I don't really hear being talked about that often, but I should at least share my thoughts about his defense. I'm not really sure what the public opinion on Thomas' defense is, but I do know that one of my friends (HUGE Pistons fan) believes that Thomas was an all-time great defender. I would guess that the majority of people think his defense is greater than it actually was. Casuals would point out his 1.9 steals per game and say that he was a very good defender, but us real fans know that defense goes way beyond just steals. I don't think advanced stats are the end-all-be-all to determine how good a defender is, but Thomas' advanced defensive stats were pedestrian. He finished his career with 39.5 DWS in 13 season which rounds out to just over 3 per season, which is decent but not great. his career DBPM is 0.2, meaning that he is just barely above average according to that stat, and his career defensive rating sits at 107, which is probably the least effective advanced defensive stat, but altogether, his advanced stats pit Thomas as an average if not slightly above average defender. If he was truly an elite defender, he probably should've made at least one all-defensive team during his career, right? Well, he didn't. Additionally, I watched some film, specifically focusing on his defense, and while he certainly give adequate effort on defense and was quick enough to keep up with pretty much everyone, his defensive IQ was suspect and he was far too small to match up with most players outside the point guard position. With everything in mind, I would call Isiah Thomas a slightly above average defender at best.

# Clutch/Leadership

Thomas has a reputation for being a fantastically clutch player and a great leader, and this is the only reputation of his that I can't really argue with. I mean, there was the time he pulled a reverse Chris Webber, ignoring his coach's frantic calls for a timeout so that he could inbound the ball to Larry Bird for the win, who if you don't already know, was on the other team. That does leave a stain on his legacy, but overall, he was great in the clutch and he deserves credit for that. And there is not much you can say about Isiah Thomas being a leader. He was the leader of the Bad Boys, a team known for their toughness and erratic behavior on the court, but he was able to make sure that most of the players remained on the team and there weren't too many internal issues in the locker room or off the court that we know of. Sure, players on other teams didn't like him, but his teammates did, and that's really what matters. Of all the players in NBA history, Thomas was one of the best in the clutch and one of the best leaders. Of course, that's not the only thing that matters in an NBA career, but if you're going to praise Isiah Thomas for something, praise him for that.

# Advanced Stats

There's one thing that people who praise Thomas never talk about, which is his advanced stats, and there's good reason behind it. Talking about Thomas' advanced stats inherently lower the greatness of Thomas' career, which is the opposite of what Isiah Thomas-praisers are trying to accomplish. The most common advanced stat used by NBA fans is probably win shares, and Thomas finished his career with 80.7 of them. For reference, that's 154th in NBA history, behind players such as Kevin Love, Joe Johnson, Richard Jefferson, and Steve Smith. Nothing against those guys, but Thomas is unanimously considered greater than them. He posted a WS/48 of .109 throughout his career, which doesn't even break the top 250 in NBA history, and theoretically, the average WS/48 is .100 (5 players on the court at a time, .100\*5=.500, and a team getting .500 WS/48 theoretically means they win half their games), so according to this stat, Thomas is barely an above average player. His career BPM is 2.6, which ranks 84th all time, behind players like Al Horford and Maurice Cheeks. An average BPM is 0.0, so Thomas is definitely above average in this stat, but +2.6 is not top 40-25 status. Finally, he has a career VORP of 41.6, which is a respectable 51st all time, but even then, his rank in VORP is clearly below his career all-time ranking according to most people. Advanced stats aren't everything, but it's not like they exist for no reason and are completely useless. I don't think Thomas is as low on the all-time list as his advanced stats indicate, but his advanced stats suggest that maybe he wasn't really all as effective as we all thought he was.

# Supporting Cast

The most common thing that people who say that Isiah Thomas is underrated highlight is what he did in the playoffs. In terms of an individual standpoint, this is warranted. Thomas increased both his volume and efficiency, pretty much across the board in the playoffs. Additionally, his advanced stats are much improved in the playoffs as opposed to the regular season. However, what I think is overstated is the difficulty of Thomas' playoff runs. People mention the fact that Thomas beat Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Michael Jordan in the playoffs as if he's some kind of assassin that dominates legendary players and teams and sends them home packing. This simply isn't true. First of all, his supporting cast was legendary. He consistently played with 4 Hall-of-Fame or all-star level players in Joe Dumars, Dennis Rodman, Bill Laimbeer, and Adrian Dantley/Mark Aguirre. There was also John Salley, Rick Mahorn, and Vinnie ""The Microwave"" Johnson off the bench and a twice-over Hall-of-Fame coach Chuck Daly to support these players. On top of that, it's important to consider that all these players played together on the same team for quite a while, and they had one of the strongest identities of any basketball team in history. All said, the Bad Boy Pistons were a legendary team, and Thomas just happened to be the leader of that team.

# Competition

Either way, all of the teams Thomas is credited for beating were not nearly at their peak. Thomas and the Pistons beat Larry Bird and the Celtics in 1988 and 1989, and at that time, Bird, McHale, Parish, and Dennis Johnson were all in their thirties. They won 57 games in 1988, so it was still an accomplishment to beat them then, but in 1989, they only won in 42 games and Bird missed the whole season. And to add to that, the Celtics beat the Pistons in 1985 and 1987, so at best, the Pistons' record against the Celtics was 2 for 4. Thomas also gets a ton of credit for him and the Bad Boys beating the Showtime Lakers in 1989. In this season, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was 41, and averaging just 10 points per game. Furthermore, Pat Riley notoriously overworked this team leading up to the Finals, so they were exhausted during the series. Finally, the Lakers beat the Pistons the year prior, so at best, the Pistons are 1 and 1 against the Lakers. The last team is Jordan's Bulls, and unlike the Lakers and Celtics, the Pistons did actually beat them more times than the Bulls beat them. However, the first two times, the Bulls didn't have Phil Jackson as their head coach, and the last time, Phil Jackson was a rookie coach. To add to this, these Bulls teams were incredibly young, as neither Jordan, Pippen, nor Horace Grant were above the age of 26 in any of these series.  When the Bulls were experienced enough and truly ready to contend, they swept the Pistons. So yes, Thomas technically beat Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Michael Jordan, but Thomas' supporting cast was nothing short of perfection and none of these players' teams were at the top of their games.

I don't see how you can call Isiah Thomas underrated if you know all of this information. He was certainly an all-time great, and there's no debating that, but if you're putting him any higher than 25th all-time, you're probably forgetting a few things about his career. Personally, I have him 35th on my all-time list, although I would have no problem with someone putting him as high as 25th or as low as 40th. He's 9th on my list of all-time point guards, behind Magic Johnson, Jerry West, Stephen Curry, Chris Paul, Jason Kidd, Oscar Robertson, Steve Nash, and Walt Frazier, who everyone seems to overlook when making all-time rankings.

tl;dr: Isiah Thomas was an all-time great, especially in terms of his playmaking, clutch, and leadership, but due to the fact that people overlook his inefficient scoring, average defense, poor advanced stats, ridiculously good supporting cast, and overrated competition, he is often labeled ""underrated"" when he is in fact properly rated.",nbadiscussion

1380,385,30% of all shots made by James Harden come from Step Back Jumpers,"James Harden, better known as ""The Beard,"" probably has the most famous Signature move of today. Step Back jumper. Harden perfected that weapon to the maximum. The fact that a defensive player can do his best and constantly be glued to Harden while ""The Beard"" just makes a step back and scores over defender's hand is devastating for any defensive player.

Here is a [chart](https://i.imgur.com/EqzgiRf.png) which shows the distribution of shots made by ""The Beard""

According to statistics from [stats.nba.com](https://stats.nba.com/), Harden has scored 182 step-back shots this season, nearly 80 more than his other weapon: a Driving Layup. This is really no wonder as of the total of 603 field goals made this season, Harden has created as many as 517 shots for himself (so 85% of the shots are not assisted). Oh and yes, of those 182 step back jumpers, as many as 176 are three pointers. Impressive.",nbadiscussion
1381,386,What is your ideal/prototypical lineup?,"I tried to post this to the r/nba and got very few responses and even less with much substance, so I decided to try out this sub and see what you guys think. So, as the title says, who would you put in your ideal lineup? Or, phrased another way, if you were building a lineup from scratch, what kind of players would you want? I’m looking for realistic answers of teams that could at least theoretically exist. You aren’t necessarily restrained to the salary cap, but you obviously aren’t going to have Steph/Harden/Kawhi/AD/Gobert. Here’s mine as an example:

PG - Patrick Beverley: with all the superstar point guards in the league right now, I want someone who can play good defense. I also want somebody who can shoot the ball on offense and Beverley’s 38% career average on 4 threes a game will do the trick.

SG - Klay Thompson: the rationale here is actually pretty similar to Beverley. I want a 2 guard who can provide good defense and spacing. Klay Thompson is elite at both and at 6’7” and 215 pounds, he also has the size to guard the 3 if need be.

SF - LeBron James: from the 3 spot, I need someone who can provide playmaking and versatility. LeBron’s elite playmaking ability is especially important since I prioritized defense over playmaking at the 1. LeBron is not only the perfect point forward, but one of the most complete and versatile players to ever play the game.

PF - Pascal Siakam: again, here I’m looking for versatility, defense, and 3 point shooting. Siakam provides all of that and has showed improvement as a secondary playmaker and creator. He can switch 1 through 4 and bump down to the 3 when LeBron is out or if we need to get another big in the game. 

C - Myles Turner: at the 5 spot, I’m looking for the mythical 3-and-D big man. I want someone who can protect the paint and also help provide spacing at the other end. Turner’s averages of 39% from deep and 2.7 blocks per game last season make him the ideal man to fill that kind of role. He’s really a perfect big for today’s NBA.

Now, when I originally came up with this idea, I was thinking purely starting 5, but I think it would be fun to expand that to essentially an 8 man playoff rotation. Seeing how the key contributors off your bench complement those starters can help justify some of your picks in your “ideal 5.” So, on top of my starting 5, I’m including one backup big, one backup wing, and one backup guard.

Backup Big - Serge Ibaka: I wanted a big with the ability to play the 4 or the 5 depending on the other teams lineup and Serge definitely has the ability to do that. Like Turner, he kind of belongs in that 3-and-D big category even though his 3 pt percentage dropped to 29% last season (career average: 36%). He would be a nice complement to both Turner and Siakam.

Backup Wing - Terrence Ross: for my backup wing, I wanted someone who can at least play average defense and maintain the spacing that we have in our starting lineup. Ross has been a capable defender over the years and averaged 38% from 3 last year on 7 attempts per game.

Backup Guard - Lou Williams: we’ve focused on defense and shooting a lot in our lineup, but we don’t have a whole lot of offensive creators outside of LeBron. I decided to fix that here by adding one of the most potent bench scorers in the NBA. He can come in off the bench and give LeBron a break from being the primary offensive catalyst and the rest of the lineup should be able to help hide him defensively.

With that, we’ve finished our 8 man rotation. I tried to keep it relatively realistic (i.e. try not to put 5 max guys in your starting lineup), but let me know what you think! Where could my lineup be improved? What’s your lineup? I’m genuinely just interested to see what people think.",nbadiscussion
1382,387,Robert Covington's seamless adaptation to Houston Rockets' Defensive Scheme,"After Houston Rockets pulled off the deal for Robert Covington at this year's trade deadline many wondered what are the Rockets doing and how will their team look, especially in the defense. Well, they are doing as good as before, maybe even better, and one of the biggest factors in their Defense has been Robert Covington.

But first, let's go back to the beginning of the career of Robert Covington.

## Early Days in the NBA

Covington went undrafted in the 2013 NBA draft, after which he played for Rockets in Summer League. They were pleased with him and signed him to an NBA contract. However, he spent most of his first NBA season in D-League (now G-League) playing for Rio Grande Valley Vipers.

He was named an All-Star that season and became MVP of the All-Star game, he continued with great performance through the rest of the season and won the Rookie of the Year award in D-League. Even then he displayed what he is best at, shooting and defending. Covington has averaged 23.2 PPG while shooting 37% for 3. Along with that, he averaged 9.2 rebounds and 2.4 steals and 1.4 blocks per game, proving already then that he is a complete defensive player.

## Heart of the Process

At the end of 2013-14 season, Covington signed a 4-year contract with Philadelphia 76ers. Immediately in his first season, he surged to the starting lineup. He maintained a pretty similar role as he had while he was at college and in G-League, playing as a Small Forward. In my opinion, he represents the heart of the 76ers' _Process_, an undrafted player who wasn't given a chance in other NBA teams but thanks to his constant hard work and playing hard in the D-League he proved himself as a serviceable NBA player.

He earned respect through seasons as one of the prime 3 and D players in the NBA. He was the ideal fit for Sixers' play style, as he could have spread the floor in the offense and cover anyone in the defense, taking on best opposing Guard or Forward. His defensive excellence was officially recognized in the 2017-18 season when he was named into the NBA's All-Defensive First Team.



This brings us to the [first chart](https://i.imgur.com/fXA46qR.png). This is RoCo's defensive chart, which shows the success of defending the opposing players based on the distance to the basket. He was mostly situated on the 3pt line, defending either three-pointers or long mid-range shots. He was defending the three-pointers quite good, a bit below the average NBA player. But it's worth mentioning that RoCo led the NBA that season in deflections per game, which shows his relentlessness on the defensive side.

## Move to the Timberwolves and injury struggles

But as the pedigree of the Sixers grew, there was, unfortunately, no place for Covington in already _Processed_ Sixers. He was shipped to Minnesota along with Šarić. He struggled in Minnesota, mainly with injuries. He sustained a knee injury and mentioned he was struggling to cope with that as that was the first big injury in his career. However, he managed to successfully jump back into the action this year posting up similar numbers as in the 2017-18 season. Which brings us to this year's trade deadline.

## Change of Style in Houston

As I was always saying, RoCo's primary position while in 76ers was Small Forward. That kind of already started to shift towards the Power Forward position in Timberwolves. Well with Rockets, Covington plays mostly C/PF position. And he adapted to it gracefully.

Since the trade to Houston Rockets, he is [3rd in total blocks](https://i.imgur.com/H8ZWJMs.png) with 35. He managed to get that number of blocks in 14 games which aren't a lot of games but that is still a significant sign of change in his position and style.

### Focusing on Paint Coverage

Once a top perimeter defender, Covington is now faced with a new role, as he or PJ Tucker are often guarding the centers. Also, they sometimes mix it up with a bit of a zone defense (Box and One, or a 3-2 zone) where again Covington and Tucker stay low. But as mentioned, Rockets most of the time play the usual man-to-man defense with one advantage over (most) other teams. They can switch ANYTHING. All of their guards are taller than average, so quite often Harden ends up in the middle of the paint guarding the opposing center, and the rest of the team swarm the center to put the pressure on.

The result of everything I said is that there is a big difference in the areas where Covington is defending the shots.

In [Minnesota](https://i.imgur.com/K1wT817.png), he spent most of the time on the perimeter, around 3 point line. He was as good defender in Minny as he was during his stint in Philly. However, his interior defense was rather lacking. That could be attributed to the overall bad defense that the Wolves had, but still, it is a pretty bad percentage.

Well, there is a big difference in the [Houston chart](https://i.imgur.com/ZWr7k8S.png) from the previous one. First of all, look at how much happier Robert is. Secondly, as I already mentioned he spends a lot more time in the post and defending centers, hence the number of defended shots around the basket is a lot higher. The number on the perimeter also increased, which can be attributed to the fact that Rockets switch almost everything so Covington often sticks to the offensive player until he shoots the triple. And while he regressed a bit at that distance, he is still a really good defender. That regression can be maybe tied with the fact than he can sometimes be a bit late to cover the three point shot when he plays on the low post in soft-zones which I mentioned before.

Nevertheless, the really good defensive efficiency close to the basket, for a 6 ft 7 forward, is a huge improvement for him, as well as the Rockets' team as a whole.

### Hustle remains, but in a different way

Covington is known for his high work rate on the defensive side. That usually manifested in a high number of deflections, which would lead to a steal either by him, or his teammate, or it would just generally disrupt the offensive flow.

However, with his move to the Rockets, that changed a bit. His number of deflections took a bit of a hit but remains high, but the positive news is that the number of contested shots, especially 2 point shots, increased significantly.

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/pmNXTKM.png) you can see how he moved from the middle of the pack in Contested shots, towards the top of the pack.

This amount of contested shots per game, during his 14 game stint with Rockets, is also the [highest of his career, by far](https://i.imgur.com/pdMntSv.png).

I mentioned in the introduction chapter that Covington led the league in deflections when he was selected for the NBA All-Defensive team. Well, he lead the league season before that as well. His 2018-19 season was shortened by the knee injury, and his number did take a bit of a hit, but they were still pretty elite. Numbers kept decreasing in all categories this season before the trade, after which the number of contested shots skyrocketed.

### Impact on the Team

His impact can be seen by looking at the advanced ratings, which calculate the number of points produced per 100 possessions (offensive rating) and points allowed per 100 possessions (defensive rating). While he generally doesn't add anything special on the offensive side (I'll touch on that later), he boosts the Rockets [significantly on the defensive side](https://i.imgur.com/mfTNhDi.png).

When he is on the court, the Rockets have a better (smaller) defensive rating by 6.3 points per 100 possessions. That is a really big boost. However, as with all other stats and charts I plotted, it's just on a 14 game sample. But if anything, it's a positive sign that Rockets pulled of a good trade.

## Offensive game

Even though this is mostly a look at Covington's defensive side of the game, I'll quickly touch on his offensive adjustment, well actually, he didn't have to adjust much, as he was already playing in a Moreyball mindset.

His [shot chart from Minnesota](https://i.imgur.com/BJkWhHB.png) did, however, have several mid-range jumpers.

But with the move to Houston, coach D'Antoni and the [staff corrected that](https://i.imgur.com/RfGMuL7.png), now he shoots it only from three-point range or paint. I'm not sure how he allowed himself to shot that single mid-range shot though.

Generally, the volume of three-pointers increased in Houston, he shots 1.5 more three-pointers per game than in Minnesota, with even better efficiency. He was already pretty much a Catch and Shoot type of player as he had 82% of shots assisted in Minny. That number jumped to 94% in Houston. But generally, we can agree that his offensive game fits the Rockets perfectly.

## Conclusion

Covington returned to the Rockets' team almost 6 years after they gave him his first NBA contract. Who knows how his career would have developed had they decided to keep him. He would have fitted in perfectly in Houston's system all these years. A great wing defender, who is capable of defending big men AND switching onto faster guards. And to complete the package he shoots the three-pointer solidly.

Even if this *micro Ball* experiment doesn't turn out great in the end, it is one of the more interesting things to watch develop by the end of the season. And given that the post game is in the slow process of dying, maybe Rockets will turn out to be the crazy and misunderstood *geniuses* and come out on top?

1384,389,"Should the league alter the rules on how max (well, I should say supermax) contracts count against the salary cap?","Purely hypothetical, it's been flying around in my mind since Charlotte let Kemba walk, but the supermax is starting to feel more like a curse for teams than it is a blessing for players. We saw with Charlotte let the best player in their franchise's history walk because paying him the supermax would have been more detrimental then him walking out the door for nothing. And Charlotte with Kemba isn't the first team that's shown signs of being fucked by the supermax.

Houston with Chris Paul, arguably OKC with Russ, Washington with John Wall, to a slightly lesser extent because it wasn't a *super*max but Mike Conley in Memphis, it all is looking like the supermax makes teams choose between title contention and loyalty to their players. The only supermax that hasn't blown up in someone's face yet is Steph's and that was because he's already delivered Golden State 3 rings. And lord only knows that Portland is on a tight clock with Dame's supermax hovering on the horizon.

I would never propose cutting into these guys's paychecks. They earn that money because they make it to the conversation of best in their position in the best (and one of the most profitable) league(s) in the world. But the supermax currently feels more like a double edged sword then I think was intended. And this double edged sword has cut the deepest in small markets.

My only conclusive thought on this has been that there should be 1 uniform max cap hit on a contract, and then if the player is supermax elligible that gap between max and supermax money should be payable as a bonus that doesn't count against the cap. It's just that currently the NBA's players have trended towards ""squading up,"" and leaving supermax money on the table. Guys like LeBron, KD, Kawhi, etc. Have all left their drafted teams so for the *elite* elite players the supermax doesn't even do it's job at that point. The supermax really only helps players that are not-quite-the-best cash in on the end of their primes at the expense of their team's flexibility and championship contention unless you're literally an MVP. *Fun fact: of the past 10 MVPs, only 3 of them have been in* ***The top 10*** *highest paid players in the NBA. '18 Harden, '17 Westbrook, and '13 LeBron.* To dovetail in with that, LeBron is 1 of 2 players this decade to win the NBA championship the year they won MVP, the other being Steph Curry in '15.

These NBA superstar guys have the people around them to calculate that their best chance at a title is to form a team in Miami, or Los Angeles, or Brooklyn and then once they've done their winning in X, Y, or Z location it doesn't even really matter that they shaved a few million off their NBA paycheck because being the man on a championship team comes with its own endorsement money that'll more than make up a slight paycut at the NBA level.

#TL:DR Supermaxing has become a trap. Should the league look at adjusting the rules on how supermaxes hit the cap and limit a team's flexibility in an effort to further help teams (especially small markets) retain their ability to build around star players they've drafted?",nbadiscussion
1385,390,Where will Russell Westbrook and James Harden rank on all time lists if the Rockets win a ring this season?,"I was looking at some predictions for the playoffs and it got me thinking, if the Rockets win the ring, where will Westbrook and Harden rank on all time lists for their positions? 

Westbrook is already a historically good player and a borderline top 10 PG of all time, but main thing that stops him from being top 7 or more is team success, or the lack of it. With a ring, he would prove that he can win and co-exist with other stars, and a finals MVP would even more cement his place as one of the best PGs ever. 

Harden is already probably a top 6 SG in history. Only players that are still surely better than him are Jordan, Kobe, Wade and Iverson. Same as for Westbrook, Harden didnt have much luck with team success in his career, but his scoring is something that we havent seen since Kobes prime and it is really incredible. With a ring Harden jumps to top 4 in my opinion, and a finals MVP could give him a chance to pass Wade in the future.

What do you think, where will they rank when their careers are over?",nbadiscussion
1386,391,"The Lakers are making the Rockets play their style of basketball, despite hardly playing McGee and not playing Howard at all","It was well discussed coming into this series that the Rockets would most likely force LA to not play McGee or Howard. Neither player possesses the ability to guard a team as fast and perimeter oriented as the Rockets, especially since neither player has any post game, nullifying the biggest disadvantage a small team faces on the defensive side.

But this doesn’t mean the Rockets are dictating the pace. Slowly, the Lakers are wearing the smaller Rockets down by forcing the pace of the game to a crawl at select moments. The Rockets made a clear effort tonight to try to match the Lakers points in the paint advantage, somewhat abandoning their focus on volume three point shooting (only 30 attempts in game 3, matching the Lakers) in favor of a heavy focus on driving to the rim; most likely a response to their streaky shooting nature failing them in game 2 (losing by 8 despite shooting 41.5 percent on 52 3PA).

The problem is, even without McGee and Howard, the Lakers are *still* too big and strong for Houston’s small ball style. They’ve now been out rebounded the last two games, and despite their aggressiveness attacking the rim early, they were still outscored 56-46 in the paint, and found themselves completely stifled attacking the rim by the end of the game, with the Lakers clearly having an advantage in terms of energy.

Houston’s strategy tonight indicated to me they have serious concern that they can beat LA launching threes like they did in game 2, and instead are opting to try to beat the Lakers inside, taking advantage of what should be a weakness in the interior with no true 5 on the floor. Problem is, with AD and Lebron on the court, the Lakers can still protect the paint for stretches. The Rockets don’t have this luxury with PJ Tucker and Robert Covington.

The Lakers defense is no doubt influencing the statistics to a certain extent, deliberately chasing the Rockets off the three point line and banking on Lebron and AD’s help defense to get their stops. Still, it’s clear the Lakers are the team dictating the pace of this series so far, small ball or no small ball.",nbadiscussion
1387,392,Why is R.J. Barrett already being labeled a bust by some people?,"I've seen people who are already saying that Barrett is bad, and that baffles me. Maybe compared to guys like Zion and Ja who are future All-NBA level players at least, yea, he's not as good, but he's still a very talented player. He's averaging about 14 a game, and yea, it's on only 40% efficiency, and yea, he only shoots 32% from three on only 3.5 attempts a game, but you have to think about how horribly built around R.J. this Knicks team is. R.J. is a good ball handler who has potential to be more of a passer than his 2.5 assists a game would suggest, as the Knicks refuse to use him properly. He isn't a very good shooter, so he needs at least above average spacing around him to thrive, and he needs the chance to be a pseudo-PG in that he's the primary or close to primary ball-handler, and he actually has a chance to run the offense.

I know he hasn't proven just yet that he has the merit to completely build a team around him, but can we give the man more to work with than Taj Gibson and Elfrid Payton. I'm fine rolling Mitchell Robinson out there for his youth and potential, but you need shooters surrounding those two to be competent, and the Knicks have instead decided that playing (insert one of the 18 veteran, back-to-the-basket PFs on the Knicks roster) and Robinson plus Payton and even Frank Ntilikina is a good idea.

After the Marcus Morris trade, a good trade for a rebuilding team with a valuable veteran, R.J. lost his only very good shooter and creator on offense on the team, and the lineup that he has played the most with is Payton - himself - Moe Harkless - Julius Randle - Taj Gibson. Ew. The fact that the Knicks refuse to give Robinson more of a shot to develop is criminal, and I really hope they make strides to help R.J. this offseason and don't turn this into a Magic - Victor Oladipo situation where it takes Oladipo (who, when healthy, I think is R.J.'s ceiling) and trades him away just a year before he takes the jump into stardom. My dream offseason for this Knicks team would be refraining from the bizarre temptation to prove that they're still a FA destination by trading assets for old CP3 and pursue Davis Bertans super hard.

Going from Randle and Gibson to Bertans and Robinson would change Barrett's world, and even just drafting a SF or PG who can somewhat shoot and take some pressure off of R.J. on offense would be great. If the Knicks draft LaMelo, the popular pick for them, and sign Bertans and lets say a decent 3 and D SF, they could go from the aforementioned Harkless and Gibson mess to a lineup of LaMelo, Barrett, insert veteran SF who can shoot above 35% from three, Bertans, and Robinson. Of course, the Knicks are the Knicks, and they might just decide that DeMar DeRozan is their star of the future, but I hope that Steve Mills is a bit smarter than Phil Jackson or whoever the last few Knicks' GMs have been (though it's unclear whether it's just Dolan making all of the decisions regardless of positions in the front office).

I think R.J. has a lot of potential as a scorer if he can get a better three point shot, and I think he can be like a more modern and valuable version of DeMar if he can also step-up his defense a bit, because he's big enough to be a solid defender. I just hope the Knicks don't ruin his future in classic Knicks fashion.",nbadiscussion

1389,394,What story about your team is flying under the national radar that we ought to know about?,"It seems like with so many stars moving, all the oxygen has been sucked out of the room for smaller stories that have the potential to blow up. I remember in 2012 Nash/Howard et al went to the Lakers, and it seemed like nothing else mattered. Except, of course, a Thunder team that had just made it to the Finals. And yet that was the year Steph Curry would break the three point shooting record, bring GS back into the playoffs, and begin an era of dominance. The Thunder and Lakers flameouts have been mostly forgotten now. 

Maybe it's not quite that big of a story (lol), but for my Blazers I have to say it's Anfernee Simons. One of our more skeptical beat reporters was interviewing players after practice, and he asked guys if the hype train had gone off the rails a little about this kid. To the contrary, people were saying he was the best player in the gym at times. 

Portland has a history of making the most of underappreciated guards, even aside from Dame and CJ. Connaughton, Crabbe, Barton, Frazier, Hood...guys come here and they play well. Simons looked so smooth in summer league--he just had an ""it"" about him I hadn't seen since Dame. Lillard himself has said he sees Simons carrying the torch when his own career starts winding down. 

Portland's guard-heavy offense seems tailor-made for Simons to come off the bench and gun away. So I'm looking at this a lot like when Wes Matthews left and space was created for CJ to flourish. I really think Portland is going to use him as a microwave off the bench, and he's a dark horse for MIP.

1393,398,Is 4-0 better than 4-6?,"You probably know where I'm going with this. If LeBron were 4-0 in the Finals as opposed to 4-6, would that be better for his ""legacy""? Because it seems that people view a finals loss as worse than being eliminated before the finals, which is just factually incorrect.

 Let's say that the 6 times LeBron lost in the finals, instead of making the finals those years, he lost in the 1st round. I realize that it would look better in 15 years when we compare it to other greats and count rings, but is it really better?

Theres no situation where being eliminated in an earlier round is better than being eliminated in the finals. It just doesn't make sense. What do you guys think? I think this is a very interesting topic.

EDIT: Just to clarify, I didnt intend for this to be a Jordan vs Bron debate. This is a question of Bron vs Bron.

1394,399,Power ranking the 22 teams expected to return to play,"Return of the NBA is on the horizon, and with it, we're sure to be getting post lock-out power rankings.

So I'm going to start the conversation a little early and bring out my rankings for discussion.

I'm looking at where things stand NOW. Obviously between the trade deadline and all the injuries that teams have put up with in the regular season, I don't hold much stock in the results that we see in the standings at present. A lot of this is just what my gut says is true. Feel free to try to CMV, but just know that relying on regular season stats probably won't do much for me... bring an argument with postseason teeth.

# Tier 1 - Expected Champion tier

*(everyone here is about 20% to win it all, imo)*

1.Los Angeles Lakers - Barely ahead of the other contenders because: 1) Bron and 2) the NBA is thirsty for Lakers success. That's a big fan base to want to keep involved for as long as possible. *^((memories of 2002))*

2.Milwaukee Bucks - Above the Clippers because they were so good (even against the teams in the West), but if I had to put money on these 2 teams in a series, I'd have a hard time betting against LAC. Really going to need Bledsoe to show up this year to stand a chance.

3.LA Clippers - They are well rested, but haven't had a ton of time playing together. And now the schedule is going to be pretty crazy... won't be a lot of time to manage loads between games. That keeps them from being as high as number 1.

4.Houston Rockets - Best backcourt by far. If their MVPs are hitting shots, other teams can not keep up. After a season of injuries, they are ready to get to the only part of the year they ever cared about, well aware that this is likely the last chance for this core (considering the owner refuses to pay tax).

# Tier 2 - Gonna need a lucky series or 2

5.Boston Celtics - Great coach, great depth, and Tatum finally started to show out as a guy that could be the best player on the court in a number of series.

6.Miami Heat - Going out on a limb a bit to suggest that what they have now is significantly better than what they had all year. Jimmy, Iggy, and Bam will make a fearsome defense... and yes, even better defense than the Wall in the North.

7.Toronto Raptors - Yeah, yeah. Sue me. I think they have maxed out so far and doubt there is another level to hit in the playoffs unless FVV has another kid. I don't trust Siakam to be better than guys on the other top squads in the East. I wouldn't pick them in a series past the first round.

8.Dallas Mavericks - Best offense in the NBA and a playoff-proven coach that will have his team ready to play. LAC better hope that Utah or OKC slip down to 7 in the last few games, because Dallas could catch them napping if the Clips aren't in a groove after the shortened season is finished.

9.Denver Nuggets - How is Dallas ahead of them? It's close, but nothing about Denver last year in the playoffs was very impressive, so I'm not sure why this year should be different.

10.Philadelphia 76ers - This team is a total wild card and could even be borderline tier one if they are all healthy and everything breaks perfectly for them in their bracket. If they can get Disney Resort feeling like 'home' then things could get crazy in the East.

# Tier 3 - Gonna need a miracle

11.Portland Trailblazers - this may be too high, but I just feel like the team can be better than everyone below them now that they are finally at full health. Too little, too late, but I'd like to see the series with the Lakers... I think they could take a game.

12.OKC Thunder - No depth. Been very lucky with their Pythagorean wins. Don't expect that to be enough to actually win a first round series in the West unless they catch Denver sleeping.

13.Indiana Pacers - Are they really going to beat any of the other top East teams? I don't see it... convince me otherwise, though. Maybe if they get lucky they can get past the first round, but no way they can get past the second.

14. Utah Jazz - I just don't think they have anything left now with all they have been through and the Bojan injury on top. Maybe if they can find a way to match up with Denver or OKC in the first round they can get lucky for one series, though.

15.New Orleans Pelicans - this may be too high, but I just feel like the team can be better than everyone below them now that they are finally at full health. Too little, too late, but I'd like to see the series with the Lakers... I think they could take a game.

# Tier 4 - Lucky to be here at all

(*whether because of an easy schedule, an easy conference, or the grace of Silver... I'm not going to waste time writing about them and barely wanted to take the time to rank them)*

16.Memphis Grizzlies

17.Orlando Magic

18.Brooklyn Nets

19.Sacramento Kings

20.San Antonio Spurs

21.Phoenix Suns

# Tier 5 - Seriously?

(*these guys should not be here, but it will make life a little more interesting for whichever team loses more games between the Nets and Magic)*

22.Washington Wizards

***Edit: it seems as if a lot of people don't really understand what power rankings are. They are one person or committee's personal opinions of teams' strengths. If one wants to organize them by metric, there is a thing called 'the standings' which is helpful for attaining those ends. This is not based on regular season results, but merely my opinion of where teams currently stand. Power rankings are subjective by the very nature.***

I just don't think your top-end talent is quite as good as Boston's or Miami's. And that's okay. You're still close - just a notch below.*",nbadiscussion
1395,400,"""The[Warrior's] dynasty is over, they had a great run."" -Klay Thompson"," ""It just kills me inside when I see these other teams, so many talking  heads and some of my peers saying, 'The dynasty is over, they had a  great run.'"" Thompson said in ""Above The Water,"" a short documentary  chronicling his rehab. 

Am I the only person who thinks like he does? I am not a Warriors fan so this isn't some fan-boying, but I still think he has a point once healthy.  They traded for Wiggins this season which IMO is slightly better than Barnes, worse on defense but better offensively. That puts their HEALTHY lineup at:

PG: Curry

SG: Thompson

SF: Wiggins

PF: Green

C: Looney

So that puts them at a bench and a 2015 Andrew Bogut(5.4/7/2.3 and great Defense) away from their 73 win team. As I said before I give a slight edge to Wiggins over Barnes and I think he has a chance to really grow into a good player in a better environment than the dysfunctional T-Wolves . Also they are going to have an extremely high pick(currently the first) this year which they can either use or flip for a defensive big and some role players which would also improve their team. There are obvious issues: they have aged, teams have figured out how to beat them(get a switch onto Curry, which perhaps a defensive center would help with) and the West has significantly improved(namely the Lakers and Clippers). I know that the 73-win bench was absolutely insane and I doubt they will ever have better depth. But I think we(fans and media) are both dismissing the dynasty as over too soon. I definitely don't think that they'll win 73 again but I could see some Conference Championships or maybe even another Title.

My main thoughts are:

1) Why are they completely written off, given the deep extent of injuries?

2) Has everyone forgotten that they had 73 wins BEFORE Durant and that the starters from that team are mostly intact?

3) This team might be one the first examples of an actually good team (with 2 All-Stars and 2-NBA All Defensive Team)that gets the first pick.",nbadiscussion
1396,401,I think this Rockets team will surprise people,"At first glance, Harden & Westbrook look like a disaster. But the more I watch and the more I read, I think they compliment each other perfectly.

Harden needed a guy who could take off scoring and ball-handling pressure. This is why he struggled in the postseason but now that Westbrook is there, he can have more catch-&-shoot opportunities and he can even have breaks offensively. 

As for Westbrook, he never had a team full of great shooters. PG was good but not great. Now he can expect to facilitate and not score, which means you might see Westbrook play solid defense now that he doesn't have to shoot 24 shots. 

And for Houston as a whole, they needed a guy who could cut, finish at the rim, and get to the FT line. With Westbrook it seems they filled that role. 


With all of this said, there will be a learning period and they might struggle a bit. But I think around January they'll heat up and make a run in the playoffs. I call anywhere from 49-54 wins.",nbadiscussion

1398,403,"The Post-Up Isn't Dead, It's Just Taking a Nap","I've been thinking a lot about how basketball has changed over the years and what's the next trend that will define the NBA. Obviously, the 3pt revolution is the current hotness, but this won't last forever. Eventually, shooters will become too highly valued to be stock-pile-able and defenses will figure out a tactic to counter it. Also, if small-ball continues to down-size centers and power forwards, there'll be vulnerabilities inside. It might seem like this current style will last forever, but it probably felt the same way in the 90s and early 2000s when the torch passed from MJ to Kobe and Shaq and Duncan were in their prime.

I also stumbled upon this article from January (https://www.insidehook.com/article/sports/the-future-of-the-nfl-is-in-baltimore-and-san-francisco), which is about how NBA teams can learn from how the Ravens and 49ers rushing games combined modern and old-school tactics and decimated defenses. It has a lot of points that I agree with, so I'll excerpt the parts that I found most relevant here (note: I'm not sure if the stats cited in this are still totally accurate since the piece is over a month old): 

""Just as the Ravens and 49ers took over the NFL by adapting smashmouth football to the spread-offense era, plus-sized playmakers are poised to update post play....Doncic is already the league’s fifth most efficient post-up player, generating 1.18 points per possession from the post. Siakam’s herky-jerky post game has helped transform him into Toronto’s post-Kawhi Leonard star; Ben Simmons has a 5:1 assist-to-turnover ratio when dishing from the post. To wit, stockier guards are also finding success in the post, with all-stars like Jimmy Butler and rookies like R.J. Barrett thriving in equal measure.

Certainly, Joel Embiid and LaMarcus Aldridge — and DeAndre Ayton, if we’re being super generous — proudly continue the lineage of post-centric stars, but the future of post play has evolved. No longer are post-ups Godzilla vs. Mothra showdowns where two large men assert their manliness one baby hook at a time. Instead, post-ups in 2020 reveal the fault lines of defenses that are forced to choose whether to prevent threes and leave one overmatched defender marooned against LeBron James or provide help at the rim and risk giving up open threes. ...

Today, three-point shooting is basketball’s most widely valued skill, but the next big market inefficiency will be finding players who can fully capitalize on the space all this shooting affords. The traditional big man may be gone, but the post-up will eternally recur.""",nbadiscussion
1399,404,Franchise cornerstone: De'Aaron Fox or Luka Doncic?,"I know we talked about this once 8 months ago ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/a56s2q/serious_would_you_rather_start_a_franchise_with/) for those interested), but due to Fox's sustained shooting since that time, the growth in subscribers, and my intention to be a little bit more specific,I think it is worthwhile to revisit the discussion. So let's get into it.

Fox stats (slash line rounded): 17/7/4. 50% eFG, 54% TS, 37% on 3s at 3 attempts a game, 0.378 free throw rate, 5.6 win shares, 1.1 BPM, 2.0 VORP, 1.7 PIPM, 1.82 RPM.

Doncic stats (slash line rounded):  21/6/8. 50% eFG, 54.5% TS, 33% on 3s at 7 attempts per game, 0.409 FTr, 4.9 win shares, 4.1 BPM, 3.6 VORP, 1.4 PIPM, 1.29 RPM. 

Takeaways from the numbers: Fox shot much better over the past season than most expected, but Luka's vastly higher number of attempts and range make his shooting, to me, more valuable for spacing and warping of the defense. Of the advanced stats, I think PIPM and RPM, as per usual, do a better job of capturing how close this is right now than the pure box stats, with dRPM really punishing Luka (-1) and accounting for the difference in RPM overall.

Now that we (with some help from the impact metrics) have seen that right now both guys have about the same overall impact on their team, I would like to make a few comments about their games.

Fox and Doncic are both quite good passers for how young they are. From watching them both a decent amount, it seems to me that Luka is a better pure passer, making better reads out of the PnR and manipulating the defense with his vision more(not that Fox doesn't do these things, Doncic just seems to do them better). Doncic probably sees the game about a half step ahead of where Fox does at this point in time. 

Not so fast, though. While Luka is probably the better pure passer, passing very much depends on creating separation from your man, breaking down the defense, and creating opportunities for your teammates that no amount of vision can will into existence. This separation is an area where Luka struggles and Fox excels. I do not know how to index Ben Taylor's creation stat in a way that allows me to report it here, but if anyone else does I would really appreciate it. Overall, Fox's ability to destroy a defensive game plan with his athleticism, create chaos and attendant opportunities for his team like a young Westbrook, cause me to lean towards Fox as an overall playmaker at this point in their very young careers. 

One other important aspect that is even more difficult to quantify is the infamous gravity of a good shooter. Luka shoots how people think Trae Young shoots: often, pretty well, and from anywhere. As his Hardenesque attempts and style suggest, Luka is a threat that forces the defense to bend in various directions. As the talent around him improves, this spacing only becomes more valuable and probably gives Luka an ability to play with other great players that I'm not sure Fox has. 

Given that this is getting pretty long at this point, and what I take to be the biggest strength of both players has been discussed at some length, I would like to comment quickly on their biggest weaknesses. 

Fox has almost no right hand to speak of, and while his sheer athleticism allows him to work around this in the regular season, playoff game plans will likely expose this if the Kings make the playoffs any time soon. Harden took a considerable amount of time to overcome this entirely, and even now is only able to completely because teams are so afraid of his stepback 3--an avenue that seems unlikely to be available to Fox. 

Bringing that pretty bad -1 dRPM back into focus for Luka highlights his biggest deficiency. He doesn't seem to be a bad defender like Trae Young or even a mostly disinterested one like Booker, but his horizontal foot speed prevents him from guarding shiftier players. Doncic is a competent rebounder but lacks the strength to defend larger players. The technique isn't terrible for Doncic, but he it does need to be cleaned up. Over time, my bet is Doncic gets stronger and more technically skilled and Dallas can hide him on smaller 4s and less mobile 3s without hurting the team defense and maybe even using his high BBIQ to be a positive. Fox on the other hand has a clear defensive identity: he can guard the opposing point and be a nuisance with his quick hands and leaping ability.
He too needs to bulk up as stronger points can bully him near the basket, but that is pretty much a given for 21 year olds with his frame.

So, with all that said, who you got?",nbadiscussion

- - - 

Other interesting tidbits from the article:

- **Curry is the only player in NBA history to average, in his career, at least 20 points per game and make at least 40 percent of his 3s (on at least 100 attempts)**. He’s the red dot in [this graph](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19304836/Steph_Curry_Stands_Alone.png)—the lone figure that far up and that far to the right.

- **On the [single-season leaderboard for most made 3s](https://i.imgur.com/DXsSR0V.png), Curry ranks first, third, fourth, sixth, and ninth. That’s five of the top 10; nobody else has more than one such season that high.**

- **Curry’s individual statistics in those minutes (without KD and Klay) recall Harden’s stats from last season.** These two stat lines—on the left, Curry’s per-75-possession numbers without Durant and Thompson; on the right, Harden’s overall numbers in the 2018-19 regular season—are eerily similar, down to the exact same true shooting percentage. [TABLE](https://i.imgur.com/xUbyyPO.png)

- This season affords Curry a new opportunity to embrace the kind of individual basketball he has long skirted, which other contemporary stars have all adopted at one time or another. **Curry’s top usage season ranks just 74th all time**; this decade alone, Westbrook, Harden, DeMarcus Cousins, Kobe Bryant, Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade, DeMar DeRozan, Isaiah Thomas, Joel Embiid, Durant, and Devin Booker **have all dominated the ball more in at least one season than Curry ever has.**

- **In those 1,214 minutes with Curry but without Durant or Thompson over the last three seasons, the Warriors have still run their opponents off the floor.** On offense, they’ve scored 116.1 points per 100 possessions, a number that would lead the league every year. The same goes for their net rating, which comes in at **plus-11 points per 100 possessions.**",nbadiscussion
1401,406,The Top 500 Players in the NBA (Episode 2),"It suddenly dawned upon me.

....shit, I skipped the Orlando Magic players for the ranking.

One thing I've learned over time is ""mistakes happen"" and its' best to just move forward instead of dwelling on the past. To make up for it, I **will be posting 488-450 tomorrow morning.** The numbers in the previous article are now updated as well. Thankfully, I caught the mistake now instead of later and it hardly affected the quality of the ranking.

***506. Zach Norvell (Golden State Warriors)***

*6’5, 22.7 years old*

Norvell has nice size for a guard, a pretty left-handed jump shot, and plenty of room to grow. He did shoot under 40% in the G-League though and had a PER of just 11.4. Those stats usually could put him lower but he’s been noticed by the Lakers and Warriors, just based on a gut feeling he will probably make it in the NBA a few years.

***505. Jarrell Brantley (Utah Jazz)***

*6’7, 24.2 years old*

Honestly he probably should be higher after I watched his 13-point-performance against San Antonio in the last regular season game but to be fair that was a meaningless game. Brantley has talent though, he made the All G-League 1st team with averages of 18.9 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 1.5 steals per game. He is very muscular but moves on the court in a smooth manner. I expect a big move up next year, would not be surprised to see him crack the Jazz rotation he is very unique.

***504. Dewan Hernandez (Toronto Raptors)***

*6’10, 23.7 years old*

In 9 G-League games, Hernandez showed some damn good defensive potential (2.0 BPG, 1.2 SPG) but he is also very raw on offense shooting just 40.3% from the field. He has gotten a few minutes in the Raptors rotation in the bubble, one to monitor.

***503. Naz Mitrou-Long (Indiana Pacers)***

*6’4, 27.2 years old*

Mitrou-Long was excellent in the g-league in 2019 with over 18 PPG, and he was a fringe roster player for Utah 2017-2019. He played for Indiana this year and played 5 games and in the G-League he regressed. Had a 12 point/3 rebound/3 assist game on November 18 against the Brooklyn Nets that helped his case.

***502. Michael Frazier (Houston Rockets)***

*6’4, 26.5 years old*

Frazier was impressive in the G-League in 2019 (17 PPG) and this resulted in 13 appearances for the Rockets in 2020. Unfortunately, he seems to have regressed and shot just 24% from the field for Houston and his PER was a -0.9. Hopefully, he bounces back next year.

***501. Chandler Parsons (Atlanta Hawks)***

*6’10, 31.8 years old*

He wasn’t great on the floor but with his situation that does not matter much, I hope he is recovering from the car accident he was in a few months ago.

***500. Isaiah Roby (Oklahoma City Thunder)***

*6’8, 22.6 years old*

Roby went from averaging 3.1 PPG his freshman year of college to being the 45th pick in the NBA draft just 2 years later. In the G-League, similar to Dewan Hernandez, he showed very nice defensive potential (1.3 BPG, 1.2 SPG) but has a long way to go on offense with just 8.1 PPG. The defense helped him finish with an above-average 15.7 PER, we’ll see how he develops.

***499. Luka Samanic (San Antonio Spurs)***

*6’11, 20.6 years old*

“The other Luka”, Samanic has good scoring and rebounding ability (15 PPG/7 RPG in G-League) but his AST/TO ratio is alarming (1.4/3.1), he shot just 31% from 3, and in the G-League his PER was just 12.6. Here is a quote about his game from Youtube user “Mohammad Cali”:

*“He needs to have confidence when he wants to drive to the basket. Right now, he is hesitant, he prefers to shoot or pass up shots. I can see him spending the majority of next season in the G-League, and then being called-up near playoff time.”*

I am in the same boat as that opinion, he does have potential but he’s 2-3 years away. He is exactly 2 years younger than the previous player, Isaiah Roby, and with the Spurs development, he could be a very nice NBA player at 23.

***498. Shamorie Ponds (Toronto Raptors)***

*6’1, 22.1 years old*

Ponds was one of the more exciting players in college basketball for St. John’s and for the Raptors, the G-League team averaged over 14 PPG in the G-League with over 2 SPG. His shooting efficiency has a little bit of improvement to be made through (25% from 3, less than 60% FT). Still, he is an exciting point guard that could be a rotation player in the NBA by the time he is 24-25.

***497. Kyle Alexander (Miami Heat)***

*6’11, 23.8 years old.*

Alexander has a crazy story. He never played basketball seriously until he was a 6’6 16-year-old and his dad barged in his room and told him “You need to learn how to play basketball”.

7-years-later (as well as 5 inches taller) Alexander made the big leagues. He showed nice inside ability shooting nearly 70% from the field and averaging 2 BPG in the G-League, to go along with a stellar 23.2 PER. Even if he never develops a 3-point-shot, he could develop into a rotation big man.

***496. Zhaire Smith (Philadelphia 76ers)***

*6’5, 21.2 years old*

I was very, VERY high on Smith in the 2018 NBA draft and the peanut allergy situation that occurred was unfortunate. He lost 40 pounds and spent 6 weeks in the hospital. There is good news: Smith clearly improved in his 2nd year in the G-League and I smiled looking at his stats. In 28 G-League games, Smith averaged nearly 14 PPG while shooting over 37% from 3. Watching some highlights, Zhaire looks completely healthy now and I’m excited to see if he can live up to his potential. Remember: he just turned 21 years old, younger than some draft prospects in the 2020 draft.

***495. Zylan Cheatam (New Orleans Pelicans)***

*6’8, 24.8 years old*

Cheatam is a high-energy player who averaged 16 PPG, 11.9 RPG, and shot over 53% from the field in the G-League. Trajan Langdon, the GM for the New Orleans Pelicans, described Cheatam’s game to The Athletic shortly after the draft while saying they contacted him way before the draft even ended:

“He covers a lot of ground,” Langdon said. “He’s guarding (point guards), he’s guarding (centers). He’s helping, he’s recovering, taking away shots, forcing guys where we want to force them. He just picks things up really quickly. He’s really engaged throughout the entire practice. His energy is infectious. It’s something we knew about him, but it’s been great to watch over the first days of practice.”

In the final game of the season against the Orlando Magic on August 13, he scored 8 points while not missing a shot. The Pelicans love him and expect a move up this ranking in 2021.

***494. Josh Reaves (Dallas Mavericks)***

*6’5, 23.2 years old*

Reaves bread-and-butter is perimeter defense (2.0 steals a game in G-League, 8th in G-League for total steals) but his offensive game has a little to go (a below-average 14.5 PER in G-League.) Still, the Mavs seem to like him and he’s on the team a year after being originally signed still. 

***493. Jaylen Nowell (Minnesota Timberwolves)***

*6’4, 21.1 years old*

Nowell has very, very nice potential and I see a big move up this list next season. In the G-League he averaged 21.0 PPG, 5.2 RPG, 3.5 APG while shooting 49% from the field and 44.1% from 3. He also rarely turns the ball over, with just 0.2 turnovers a game in the G-League, and his 5.2% turnover percentage puts him in the top % of all eligible players in the NBA. Watch out for him.

***492. Romeo Langford (Boston Celtics)***

*6’6, 20.8 years old*

Langford played in 32 games for the Celtics and has been getting some minutes for the Celtics. Still, with a small sample size (only 7 G-League games), this ranking is based mostly on potential. Langford does have nice defensive potential (93rd percentile for block %) and as Romeo told The Athletic after his 1st career start:

“I just gotta be consistent. This league is all about being consistent, building from this performance,” Langford said. “It’s going to be up and down, I don’t know if I’m going to be a starter again, but just always be ready for when my name is being called.”

***491. Marial Shayok (Philadelphia 76ers)***

*6’6, 25.1 years old*

Shayok averaged over 22 PPG in the G-League while making the All-G-League 3rd team. His offensive game is silky smooth and he is a very fun player to watch scoring the basketball. Has not gotten much playing time for the 76ers and at 25 years old we don’t know what his ceiling is. His game gives me heavy Anthony Morrow vibes, I could see him having a similar impact.

***490. Antonius Cleveland (Dallas Mavericks)***

*6’5, 26.5 years old*

From attending college at Southeast Missouri State to making the NBA, Cleveland is a unique talent. He’s a 6’5 guard who averaged over 7 rebounds a game while also averaging 1.6 steals-per-game in the G-League. He has noticeable energy and defense and stood out in the bubble scrimmages and I could see him staying on the Mavs at least another season.

***489. Eric Mika (Sacramento Kings)***

*6’10, 25.6 years old*

In his 1 NBA game, Mika had 6 points and 7 rebounds for the Sacramento Kings. Mika impressed in the G-League in 2020 with 18 PPG and 11 RPG, and he is now signed overseas.",nbadiscussion
1402,407,Domantas Sabonis is on Pace to Become the 2nd Youngest Player in NBA History to Have Season Avgs of at Least 18PTS/13REBS/3.5ASTS - Underrated?,"Probably one of the least talked about players in the league. Amidst the Luka Magic, James Harden gunning for a 40 pt/avg, LeBron James defying father time, Giannis making a case for back to back MVPs etc, Sabonis is quietly putting together a historic season. 

Only 45 players have accomplished this feat and he would be the 2nd youngest if he were to sustain these averages. The youngest was none other then Kareem Abdul Jabbar who did it at 22 and currently the second youngest is Round Mound of Rebounds, our very own TNT analyst, Charles Barkley who did it at age 23 but has a later birthday then Sabonis (February 20th.) 

The infamous trade seems like one of those trades where it worked out for both teams looking back in hindsight. Indiana got back two marquee players (gws Oladipo) and now with the team consisting also of Myles Turner & Malcolm Brogdon, Indy isn't an easy 1st round shoo. OKC managed to flip PG for SGA, a trade chip in paul and treasure chest of draft picks. 

With all that being said, Sabonis was more of a throw-in at that point, it's amazing how much he's grown. I definitely think even if Oladipo comes back his numbers sustainable. Definitely an all-star this season, people need to notice what an amazing season he's having. Jrue Holiday was probably the most underrated player in 2018-2019. Is the new most underrated player this season Sabonis?",nbadiscussion
1403,408,Can We Start Having Coaches Vote for NBA Awards Instead of the Media?,"Everyone can point to a bunch of terrible choices the media has made for awards, and today's All-Defence awards were just another in a long line of examples of why the media shouldn't be voting on awards.

Guys who made All-Defence Teams this Year:

Eric Bledsoe: managed less than a steal per game, 0.4 blocks per game, and 1.6 deflections per game (which ranks him on the middle of the third page for the stat on [nba.com](https://nba.com))

Patrick Beverley: ranks 60th in defensive win shares this year, played only 51 games, had a decent 1.1 steals, 0.5 blocks and 2.2 deflections (ranks him near the top of the second page for the stat on [nba.com](https://nba.com)), played for the league's 5th best defence (which also had a first team selection, in Kawhi)

Bam Adebayo: anchored the league's 12th best defence, 40th in deflections, 43rd in steals, 18th in blocks

Guys who missed All-Defence Teams this Year:

Kyle Lowry: led the league in charges drawn (0.59 per game), 1.4 steals per game, 15th in deflections, notoriously good post defender for his position, playing for the league's second best defence.

Kris Dunn: 2nd in steals (2.0 per game) and 4th in deflections (3.7 per game)

Fred VanVleet: led the league in deflections (4.2 per game), 4th in steals (1.9 per game), 16th in loose balls recovered, played for the league's second best defence.

Jrue Holiday: 2nd in deflections (4.0 per game), 12th in steals (1.6 per game), 0.8 blocks per game (which ranks third among guards)

OG Anunoby: top wing in the league by defensive win shares (6th overall), 2.5 deflections per game, 0.7 blocks per game, 1.4 steals per game, switchable 1-5, takes the toughest defensive assignment every night for the league's second best defence

Defensive teams have always been notoriously terrible, and media members, who often don't understand much of anything about defence, often just pick guys with reputations for being great defenders (Beverley, Smart, Bledsoe, etc), without actually understanding how well those guys have actually done in the given year.

But, then again, there are tons of bad decisions that we see on all kinds of NBA awards. It is certainly not specific to defensive awards. Just looking at some of the ballots media members submitted for All-NBA teams, there are a ton of guys who should lose their voting privileges.

**So, why do we have media hot take artists voting on these awards?** They have built in biases (national media tend to favour big markets and flashy players who draw big ratings), and a lot of media people are not super knowledgeable about the game itself.

**Why don't we just let coaches vote on these awards?** These guys have their jobs specifically because they are supposed to be the best basketball minds out there. Coaches are balanced between all markets, and are the people who actually have to scheme in real time against these players. Coaches know perfectly well when a player is blowing up their schemes, while media members may have no clue, because they might not even know how a scheme was supposed to work in the first place.",nbadiscussion
1404,409,Who’s winning the ring this year,"It’s what basketball is all about. Who’s going to come home from the bubble with a trophy. If the Orlando bubble doesn’t get cancelled in the coming weeks, then who do you want to or think is going to win the finals. 

There are so many things that make this season so unique and make it hard to pick a favorite like you could other seasons. Right now it’s easy to say the bucks because of their combination of talent at the top and throughout their lineup. Also because none of their key pieces have said they wouldn’t be attending the bubble in Orlando. Players like Avery Bradley for the lakers and Victor Oladipo for the Pacers have said they aren’t going. 

We are also going to see how this layoff has affected the players. Ja Morant has said recently he has put on 12 pounds of muscle over the break. 

There’s always the unpredictability of a 7 game series and you can never know what can happen but you can always speculate so who do you guys think will win the ring this year. As a warriors fan I’m not gonna get to see the boys play but I think they’ll come out of this fine and next season will be right back to where they were, but that’s another discussion for another time. Personally I want the clippers to win. Idk why. Ik kawhi killed us last year but for some reason I don’t dislike him for it. I’m still salty about LeBron in 2016 so I don’t want the lakers to win and I’ve always wanted to see pg13 get a ring. So my pick for the 2020 championship is the Los Angeles Clippers.",nbadiscussion

What's next for LA after this disappointing season? Injuries were a part of the Lakers missing the playoffs, but roster construction was another huge issue.

1406,411,"Looking for some opinions and takes. What are your predictions, expectations, thoughts, concerns etc for game 6 of the NBA finals?","I haven't seen a post yet, and I'm curious what everyone thinks.

Personally I think it will be another close thriller like game 5, both teams know this game is a must-win(Heat get eliminated if they lose, If the Lakers lost it's not good for them because morale would be very low going into game 7 after two missed chances), I think we'll see some desperate determination from both sides. I think the game will boil down to the role player's performances. Lebron, Jimmy and AD will likely each have monster performances like they usually do, and last game showed that even if Lebron has an all-time amazing game it depends a lot on the rest of the team. Duncan Robinson, on the other hand, played a big role in the win for Miami. Confidence levels for Morris and Danny Green may be low as well. It's really hard to see the outcome at this point, but seeing as the Lakers have always bounced back with a vengeance after losses, I think the Lakers will close it out(win by a shadow though). I think Lebron will play good but not as good as last game, probably 30-ish points. I think AD and Rondo will be phenomenal, better than last game. I think Jimmy will not be as amazing, because he's probably a bit exhausted, but I expect Herro and Nunn to have fantastic games as well.

I'd love to hear other people's opinions!",nbadiscussion
1407,412,Kirk Goldsberry's Metric For Identifying Best Shooters In The NBA,"Kirk Goldsberry (the guy who makes cool basketball shot charts) [came up with a metric](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/46e4/a7271de62e9118625dec935c4aef1bc0ea74.pdf?_ga=2.34128227.376142319.1593761416-966256004.1592516502)[ called Range%](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/46e4/a7271de62e9118625dec935c4aef1bc0ea74.pdf?_ga=2.34128227.376142319.1593761416-966256004.1592516502)[ for determining who are the best shooters in the NBA](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/46e4/a7271de62e9118625dec935c4aef1bc0ea74.pdf?_ga=2.34128227.376142319.1593761416-966256004.1592516502). 

Range% basically looks at who was able to score at a rate of 1 point per shot or better from the most spots on the court. 

This line from his article pretty much sums up his findings:

>Whether the Range% metric is the best way of quantifying shooting range or not, it seems to capture pure shooting ability better than FG% or eFG%. 

Here are the top 10 in Range% between 2006 and 2011.

>1. Steve Nash (31.6%)  
>  
>2. Ray Allen (30.1%)  
>  
>3. Kobe Bryant (29.8%)  
>  
>4. Dirk Nowitzki (29.0%)  
>  
>5. Rashard Lewis (27.6%)  
>  
>6. Joe Johnson (27.4%)  
>  
>7. Vince Carter (26.7%)  
>  
>8. Paul Pierce (25.9%)  
>  
>8. Rudy Gay (25.9%)  
>  
>10. Danny Granger (25.8%)

For the most part, Range% seems to do pretty well in identifying the best shooters but like any advanced stat it has it's flaws. The metric treats every location on the court as the same, but shooting at a rate of 1 point per shot from the three point line is way more difficult than shooting at a rate of 1 point per shot from the painted area. That's something that doesn't seem to have been taken into account.",nbadiscussion
1408,413,Where does Manu Ginobili rank all time among the best shooting gaurds?,"First off, I just want to preface that I am a huge Ginobli and Spurs fan in general. Though I am Portland born and raised and a Blazers supporter, from a basketball standpoint I just love the Spurs dynasty. 

Anyway, I recently rewatched game 7 of the '05 finals and was amazed with Ginobli on both ends of the floor. He never seemed to force anything and scored when his team needed him, especially down the stretch. 11 of his points came in the 4th quarter and was the most influential player in burying that Pistons team. 

I find it really hard to compare Manu to other players just because he doesn't have the raw statistics of even an All Star level player. Advanced and adjusted stats do him justice but typically these are forgotten in the grand narrative of star players where high volume scoring means so much. 

So where does Many lineup against the other great shooting guards of all time, or even just this current crop in the league today?",nbadiscussion
1409,414,Who will be the top 5 to 10 players in the league in 2023?,"Everyone has their on views on player rankings, and the order of the top 8 or so players in the league are very subjectively chosen right now. . 

A single post season can change one's opinion of a player. Jokic and Butler have been given a lot of props this post season; deservedly so, where as some rankings towards Kawhi and Giannis have lowered due to either underperforming or not getting to where they were expected to get to. Then, Curry, and obviously Durant have not been playing, so it's hard to know where they're at.

It's an interesting transition though; for maybe four years now the conversation about the 'next great players in the NBA' has been going on. As Doncic, Jokic, Embiid and Co improve the top ten and top five list could look very different soon. Westbrook for example has gone from being a top 5 player to a top 20 player in about 2.5 seasons.

Four years ago most people had Curry, Westbrook, Harden, Chris Paul, KD, Kawhi and LeBron among their top 5 list. Most of these guys are still floating around this area except for Paul and Westbrook

I hope Durant, Kawhi, LeBron and Harden are still playing at an elite level. I haven't watched Curry play so much in the last 1.5 years so I wouldn't know what he's looking like.",nbadiscussion

Surely that has to be overblown and a meme?! Sure, it might happen every once in a while but that has to be the exception and not the rule, right?

I am first and foremost a European soccer fan who also follows the Mavs and every soccer star would receive a six figure fine, a possible suspension of several weeks or a couple of games on the bench if anything like that ever happened. If you're a repeat offender or just a role player they might just ship you off next transfer window and no top club will touch you again before you've proven to have turned things around.

Now it seems that almost any team has a real shot at winning the championship. Depending on playoff seeding and health of course. 

But at least half the league has 2 legit star-caliber players along with a very deep, versatile bench. I mean many expect GSW to be a 6-8 seed and it stills seem their title hopes aren't dead. 

Even the teams like Indiana, Portland, Boston, and Toronto all a shot to make a deep playoff run and surprise some people. There's no clear cut top dog though most will say it's either L.A. team. 

It's just so surreal. And I'm sure everyone is excited. Even the teams that aren't playoff locks still have a shot at being competitive. Teams like Atlanta, Minnesota, NOLA, Sacramento, etc.",nbadiscussion

Some players in particular stood out for me, including Jordan Clarkson, Terrence Ross, Gerald Green and Zach Collins. So my starting 5 would probably be:

PG - Jordan Clarkson - Despite struggling majorly in last year's finals, Clarkson had a good season off the bench for a struggling Cleveland team this year. He scored very well off the bench, including 32.4% off of 5.5 attempts per game from 3. He also shot 84.4% from the free throw line, as well as scoring double figures in 72 of the 81 games he played in. Clarkson provides scoring from the point guard position.

SG - Khyri Thomas - Going for some defense here, as he may not be the most effective on the offensive end, so hopefully can compensate for Clarkson's weaknesses.  There don't seem to be many glaring defensive players in the above list, so Thomas can hopefully provide some of that.

SF - Kyle Korver - The team needs a 3 point shooter and still shot nearly 40% from behind the arc last year, even if he is now 38 years old. He has proven himself at an elite shooting level and could add some of that to this cobbled-together team.

PF - Harry Giles - Despite never starting a game (58 off the bench), Giles impressed on the glass in the second half of the season and showed his work ethic in earning more of the spotlight in Sacramento. He has potential and would bring a drive to the team that is valuable in my opinion.

C - Zach Collins - I've always liked Zach Collins, and he can provide a bit of 3 point shooting as well (33% last year), which is an area where Giles severely lacks. Collins played all 16 games in the playoffs for Portland this year, showing his value to a team like this one. He shows good qualities and could be a good option for the 5th spot on this team.

I would like to hear what others can make with this limited pool of players, as I had to think hard and research some of these players to even put them on the list. Many thanks for reading!",nbadiscussion
1413,418,KD and Klay's injuries could lengthen GS championship window,"I'm not saying that the scenario I'm about to describe is likely , but I think it is possible. I think the warriors could purposefully take their foot off the gas this upcoming season in order to gather assets that make them a stronger team once klay and KD come back.

Obviously , this scenario implies klay and KD come back ... which is not a given; but like I said earlier, this is just one of many possible paths the warriors front office could go down . 

I think they bring them back , even though , obviously, both guys are risks at this point . Unless, it was extremely transparent that both guys were offered maxes and preferred to go elsewhere. Then , I could see fans understanding it . Otherwise I think the organization takes a huge reputation hit .

Granted , bringing them back places GS in a tough position to compete this season . But, I think the front office and the fans are fully OK with taking the foot off the gas this year, if it means coming back stronger for the next 2-3 years . 

Look , KD and Klay may never be the same. I'm not saying they will be bad . Just that , there is a wide range of outcomes and I would say a decent variance within that range . Modern sports medicine is way better than before; but still, a player over 30 coming off of surgery to a knee or Achilles is a scary fucking prospect . 

To me , from here the solution is clear. They have to go younger . I'm not sure if they have the taxpayer MLE . If they do , they might not want to use it . They are deep in the tax . If I was in their shoes , I would use most of my available money to take a bunch of shots on younger guys with potential ... and see if anything sticks . I use potential in a relative sense. In other words , they aren't ""good"" yet . They have physical tools or skills that outweigh their current production. A gap in perceived future ability and current ability . 

IF GS takes this kind of approach . It's possible they might not be very good next year . They will do whatever it take to put themselves in a better position going forward. Curry and green (is he a FA ?) certainly have the ability to carry a team to regular season wins . But , the entire burden hasn't been placed on them for a while . How consistent can they be , how consistent can a bunch of vet-min type guys be ? 

Furthermore , how healthy can they stay ? Don't you think GS will be incredibly conservative with Curry and Green's health this year ? 

If GS gets off to a slow start this season , I think they could lose a fair amount of games this year . Definitely enough to miss the playoffs . The west is almost always a bloodbath. I don't know what kind of free agent movement will come this summer. But there is potential for a lot of development to already strong clubs . 

Point being , GS could end up with a lottery pick. They could end up with a top 10 pick . If curry suffers a moderate injury , they aren't going to rush him back just to try to get the 8th seed . 

Going forward fans could look forward to any promising young players GS has acquired over the last year and KD and klay returning. Klay returning to a fuller form is also a strong possibility. 

I don't know what percentage chance a situation like this has of playing out . But , I don't think it's outlandish and I think that if they hold on to KD and klay that this is a pretty strong move to be better 2 and 3 years from now . 

What do you guys think ?",nbadiscussion
1414,419,"History Says Jaylen Brown’s Shooting in the 2017-18 NBA Season Was a Fluke, and Why We Should Not Expect Jaylen Brown to Shoot Above League Average From 3 Again","Jaylen Brown had a what was considered to be a leap last season. It seemed like the raw athlete we saw his rookie year had refined his shooting mechanics, and found a way to in just his 2nd year become one of the premier 3&D players in the league. Shooting just under 40% from 3, Jaylen Brown was blistering hot from behind the line. However, one curious number had some C’s fans a little concerned about the sustainability of his 3 pointer... his FT%. Bizarrely enough, Jaylen Brown’s FT% actually went *down* 4% in his sophomore year. Quite predictably, Celtic hopefuls completely disregarded this as a simple mental issue, an entirely separate entity from his 3pt shooting. Well... it’s not. In reality, it is actually likely a more accurate predictor of his shooting ability than one season of hot shooting from behind the arch. But don’t just take my word for it, let’s look at history...

First, [just look at how insane his sophomore season was.](http://bkref.com/tiny/VXRit) Only nine players have managed to shoot 39% from 3 or over (on at least 4 attempts a game), while shooting under 65% as a FT shooter. None of the 9 players managed to repeat a season like this.

If we tweak the variables to go to Jaylen’s career averages (3 3PA/g, 37% from 3, under 66% from the line), you can see it is [just as unlikely to sustain these kind of shooting splits.](http://bkref.com/tiny/90umI) 34 players have done it, but only *three* of them repeated the season on those splits (and of those players they only were able to do it for *two seasons*). It is simply improbable to be that bad of a FT shooter while maintaining a great 3pt%.

Here’s where it gets very concerning, it’s [**even unlikely that he maintains league average if his FT shooting  remains at the level it’s at.**](http://bkref.com/tiny/EJ9nv) If you have any respect for historical precedent, it looks like, at best case scenario, Jaylen has **one** more season of shooting over league average from 3.

Even if Jaylen raises his FT% up 10% (unlikely) to 74%, the odds of shooting over 37% from 3 (his career average) while attempting three 3’s a game (what he’s done as a starter the past two years, and basically what he’s do per36 as a rookie) [is EXTREMELY unsustainable unless your name is JR Smith](http://bkref.com/tiny/12jdO)

So we’re looking at 3 possibilities here

1) Jaylen Brown is a true anomaly. Historical precedent does not apply to him. 

2) Jaylen Brown is actually a *waaaaaaaayyyyyy* better FT shooter than we’ve seen, and we should expect his FT% to at least be in the high 70’s by the end of the season. In this regard, him being a good 3 point shooter is sustainable.

3) Jaylen Brown is a mediocre shooter who had a hot year like dozens of players have had before in NBA history. It is likely that his 3pt% hangs around in the 31-34% range for the rest of his career, and if he’s lucky he’ll have one more season of heating up behind the line and shooting above league average.

Any honest, unbiased analysis of these possibilities says that \#3 is by far the most likely scenario here. Really a bummer as a Celtics fan.",nbadiscussion

I have seen a lot of different things about it potentially getting a star while others say that pick is merely worth a average starter.

1419,424,"Basketball, Stat: Player Efficiency Rating (PER)","Hey everyone,

For context, I started a series in r/nba where I wanted to go through different advanced metrics and break down how they're calculated and what they do well (or don't do well). Someone over there suggested I post here as well, so here it is.

For the first post in this series, I wanted to look at a stat that is more commonly used but still may seem a little confusing to someone that's new to basketball. And for those of us familiar with it, we probably still don't know exactly what ingredients go into pumping out the numbers we end up seeing. So with that, let's take a look at **Player Efficiency Rating, or PER**.

&#x200B;

# The Basics

PER is a stat created by John Hollinger (formerly of ESPN, currently with the Memphis Grizzlies), that attempts to encapsulate the entirety of a player's performance per minute into one single number, relative to the rest of the league (league average PER is always 15), while adjusting for pace. It is a series of terms (some positive, some negative) that are added together, resulting in one number that represents that player's contribution to his team.

&#x200B;

# The Formula

So with that, let's dive into the nitty gritty. I'll list out the formula (as found on basketball-reference.com), and below that I will define each of the variables and take a closer look at what it's doing.

&#x200B;

uPER = ( 1 / MP ) \* \[ 3P + ( 2 / 3 ) \* AST + ( 2 - factor \* ( team\_AST / team\_FG ) ) \* FG + ( FT \* 0.5 \* ( 1 + ( 1 - ( team\_AST / team\_FG ) ) + ( 2 / 3 ) \* ( team\_AST / team\_FG ) ) ) - VOP \* TOV - VOP \* DRB% \* ( FGA - FG ) - VOP \* 0.44 \* ( 0.44 + ( 0.56 \* DRB% ) ) \* ( FTA - FT ) + VOP \* ( 1 - DRB% ) \* ( TRB - ORB ) + VOP \* DRB% \* ORB + VOP \* STL + VOP \* DRB% \* BLK - PF \* ( ( lg\_FT / lg\_PF ) - 0.44 \* ( lg\_FTA / lg\_PF ) \* VOP ) \]

&#x200B;

WHEW! That, my friends, is a long equation. BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE! First of all, some of you probably noticed that this formula hasn't accounted for pace anywhere. What's more, you might have noticed that absolutely nowhere in the formula is the number 15. ""But Rob, didn't you tell me this was a pace-adjusted formula and didn't you say that it's normalized to a league average of 15?"" Congrats! You'd be correct. What is listed above is actually ""unadjusted PER,"" meaning that we haven't accounted for pace yet, or normalized it. So to get there we need to take two more steps: first we adjust for pace, which we can call aPER:

&#x200B;

aPER = uPER \* lg\_Pace / tm\_Pace

&#x200B;

Then, we normalize it at 15 being the league average to get our final PER number, which is what you see when you look up the stat online:

&#x200B;

PER = aPER \* (15 / lg\_aPER )

&#x200B;

Congratulations on making it this far! Now, you might have realized that in the above paragraph, I said ""First of all..."" but had no following ""second of all..."" in the paragraph. Well here it is! Second of all, that formula has at least one variable that is completely unrecognizable. For example, what on earth is ""factor?"" Well a couple of these are small formulas on their own, while the others are standard NBA variables. So let me just list out and explain each piece.

* MP = Minutes played (remember, this is a per minute stat)
* 3P = 3-point field goals made
* AST = Assists
* FG = Field goals made
* FT = Free throws made
* FGA = Field goals attempted
* TRB = Total rebounds
* ORB = Offensive rebounds
* TOV = Turnovers
* factor = ( 2 / 3 ) - ( 0.5 \* ( lg\_AST / lg\_FG ) ) / (2 \* ( lg\_FG / lg\_FT ) )  

   * This is admittedly the strangest part of the whole equation... I will have a section below discussing this
* VOP = lg\_PTS / ( lg\_FGA - lg\_ORB + lg\_TOV + 0.44 \* lg\_FTA )  

   * This piece of the formula is essentially estimating the value of a possession, or the average points per possession across the league, with the numerator being league points and the denominator being an estimate of league possessions. The constant 0.44 is an estimate of the percentage of free throws that end a possession. However, it should be noted VOP is not a highly accurate estimate.
* DRB% = League average defensive rebounding percentage ( ( lg\_TRB - lg\_ORB ) / lg\_TRB )
* STL = Steals
* BLK = Blocks
* PF = Personal fouls

&#x200B;

There we go! Now we have all the pieces to the puzzle. Now let's go through this monster of an equation and try and talk through what it's doing.

&#x200B;

# Parsing the Equation

We've already explained the parts about adjusting for pace and normalizing to a league average of 15, so here we will focus on what's going into uPER. Let's take it term by term:

* 1/MP \* the rest of the formula
   * Dividing by minutes played to make it a per minute stat. Easy enough.
* 3P
   * 3P made is it's own part of the equation, weighted at 1.
* \+ ( 2 / 3 ) \* AST
   * Weighting an assist as 2/3. This fact combined with the weighting of 3P is a red flag for me. Yes there are additional factors below that don't make it that simple, but already I'm starting to question the reasoning behind how this is calculated.
* \+ ( 2 - factor \* ( team\_AST / team\_FG) ) \* FG
   * Alright, starting to get fun now! Let me first state that ""factor"" is an interesting piece all on it's own, so I'll give it its own paragraph below. But with that in mind, let's simplify it by not deep-diving into ""factor"" yet. So that leaves us with 2 \* FG as a piece of the equation, then you subtract out factor \* FG \* the percentage of team's FGs that are assisted. This seems to be weighting FGs as 2, but also subtracting some value based on how many of those FGs were assisted, which makes some sense (though it's not a perfect assumption by any means). When you consider 3P was weighted at 1, this is essentially giving us **total points scored outside of FT** ( 2 \* FG + 3P ) while making a slight tweak for if they were assisted.
* \+ ( FT \* 0.5 \* ( 1 + ( 1 - ( team\_AST / team\_FG ) ) + ( 2 / 3 ) \* ( team\_AST / team\_FG ) ) )
   * Here we're starting to factor FTs. But Hollinger is also again attempting to differentiate between assisted vs. unassisted. As above, t's pretty simplified by taking the team's unassisted FG rate ( 1 - ( team\_AST / team\_FG) ) and then a 2/3 weighting of the team's assisted FG rate. So here, the player's FT is weighted between 0.83 and 1 according to the team's assist rate (.83 if every FG is assisted; 1 if no FG is assisted).
* \- VOP \* TOV
   * This is our first negative term. Again, VOP is an estimate of the league average points per possession. So here we're subtracting out the average points per possession across the league that this player lost out on due to turnovers.
* \- VOP \* DRB% \* ( FGA - FG )
   * Here we have another negative term, but this time we're subtracting out the average points per possession (across the league) lost due to missed FG. Notice we're only accounting for missed points that we assume aren't rebounded by the offensive, by taking the league average DRB% and multiplying by missed FG and again by VOP.
* \- VOP \* 0.44 \* ( 0.44 + ( 0.56 \* DRB% ) ) \* ( FTA - FT )
   * This piece of the formula looks complicated, but I'll give you the simplified version first: we are calculating expected missed points due to missed FTs. Remember that 0.44 is a constant that is the rate at which a FT shot ends a possession (in other words, 44% of FTs are the last shot of a possession, generally speaking). So that middle term is looking for the rate at which a free throw not ending the possession does not result in an offensive rebound. So ultimately here we're taking VOP \* .44 \* (an estimate of the rate at with your team does not secure an offensive rebound on a FT) \* FT missed.
* \+ VOP \* ( 1 - DRB% ) \* ( TRB - ORB )
   * This looks to be an estimation of how many points the player ""contributed"" by rebounding, thus reducing the other team's opportunity to score. So we have VOP \* the league's average offensive rebound rate \* the number of the player's defensive rebounds.
* \+ VOP \* DRB% \* ORB
   * Here we have the VOP created by offensive rebounds, weighted by the DRB% of the league (so if they league as a whole doesn't defensive rebound as well, offensive rebounds aren't as valuable)
* \+ VOP \* STL
   * This is straightforward enough: VOP created by steals
* \+ VOP \* DRB% \* BLK
   * Again, fairly straightforward: we have VOP created by the number of blocks expected to be rebounded by his team
* \- PF \* ( ( lg\_FT / lg\_PF ) - 0.44 \* ( lg\_FTA / lg\_PF ) \* VOP )
   * Finally we get to our last term: fouls. We have the number of fouls committed by our player first, and again this is a negative term so we're taking out value that our player has cost the team by fouling. Then we have the rate at which PF results in made FTs in the league (lg\_FT / lg\_PF); so far we've subtracted out the number of FT we expected our player to have caused by fouling ( PF \* (lg\_FT / lg\_PF )). Then we're adding back in (the double negative) the VOP that comes of the free throw attempts that were expected to have ended that possession (which is why we have that .44 again). To be honest, I don't love the second part of what is factored in here for fouls, as I feel like it gives too much positive value. But that said, I think the first part of this term on its own would be too harsh for penalizing fouls.

And that covers all of the different terms going into PER! Some of it is pretty straightforward. Some of it has me scratching my head quite a bit. So with that said, let's take a closer look at ""factor."" And let me say up-front that I don't fully understand this part of the equation, but I'll do my best to reason out what purpose it serves. We won't get a clear answer, but I'll give my best guess.

Our first observation we can make is that Hollinger is not a believer in simplifying equations. It could much more easily be written as factor = ( 2 / 3 ) - ( ( 1 / 4 ) \* ( lg\_AST / lg\_FG ) \* ( lg\_FT / lg\_FG ) ). But let's take a look at the way Hollinger wrote it, as I suspect he did it for a reason. Without equation language, let's try and say what we're calculating here: two-thirds, minus ( ( half of the percentage of FG that are assisted ) divided by ( 2 times the ratio of FG to FT ) ). I think it's extremely important to note that ""factor"" is applied to the team's percentage of FGs that are assisted here. So it seems like he's trying to fine tune the relationship between assists, FGs, and FTs, and make sure they are weighted in a way that is fair to the value the player is created, but it really just gets a bit too convoluted to understand without asking Hollinger himself why he did some of the things he did. So we really do hit a bit of a roadblock here unfortunately.

&#x200B;

# Strengths and Weaknesses

So now that we understand most of the ins and outs of PER, let's talk about how well we expect it to do its intended job.

**Strengths**

* Easily digestible and comparable across league
* Adjusts for the norms of a particular season by using lots of league average values for that seasons and normalizing to 15; ends up being an adjustment for different eras of the game
* Adjusts for pace and against league averages

**Weaknesses**

* Some of the constants (e.g. 0.44) are outdated and don't accurately reflect what they should
* Use of league averages don't always reflect true value; i.e. a possession lost due to TO by the 2015-16 Warriors should be more impactful than one by the 2011-12 Bobcats
* We're mainly looking at offensive performance; the two defensive stats incorporated (STL and BLK) don't necessarily translate to overall defensive impact, so that is a HUGE missing piece
* It doesn't account for who the player is playing with or against
* PER tends to favor volume regardless of efficiency
* Doesn't capture any non-box score stat that impacts the game

Now let's take a look at some historical seasons and the corresponding PER to see if we can find some examples of how it translates. I went to [basketball-reference.com](https://basketball-reference.com/) to find all PERs of players that played at least 60 games in a season in the 3-point era. Here are some of the findings:

* Historical top 100 PER seasons  

   * The top 100 looks pretty good! Better than I expected
   * The top 5 consists of 2 LeBron seasons, 2 MJ seasons, and Steph's best season.
   * Rounding out the top 10, we have some more MJ and LeBron, as well as Giannis last season (not crazy) and an Anthony Davis season (this is my first issue... AD is great, but at no point can we say he had one of the best 10 seasons of all time).
   * Kobe doesn't show up until 46, and he only has 2 seasons in the top 100.
   * I would have expected to see Harden higher, when you can make the case for arguably the best offensive season in history for both last season and the year before, but those seasons show up at 13 and 21.
   * If you change the criteria to a minimum of 54 games played, Boban shows up at 58!!!
* Role players on great teams (I believe this is an area where PER falls very short in adequately translating player value, especially defensive specialists)  

   * 2015-16 Warriors  

      * Draymond - 19.3
      * Andre Iguodala - 12.2 (12th on the team!)
      * Harrison Barnes - 12.3
   * 1995-96 Bulls  

      * Dennis Rodman - 13.6
      * Luc Longley - 11.9
      * Ron Harper - 14.4
      * Steve Kerr - 15.2
   * 1985-86 Celtics  

      * Robert Parish - 18.7
      * Bill Walton - 17.0
      * Danny Ainge - 13.6
   * 1999-00 Lakers  

      * Robert Horry -. 14.3
      * Ron Harper - 12.0
   * 2012-13 Heat  

      * Mario Chalmers - 13.3
      * Shane Battier - 10.7

# Conclusion

There we have it! Hopefully this either refreshed you or gave you a new understanding of what PER is, how it works, where it falls short, and provides some context for you next time you compare players with PER. It was one of the first advanced analytics out there, so while it isn't perfect by any means, I have to respect it as being a step in the right direction of trying to evaluate player past what's in the box score. I think there are many better ways of measuring that today, but PER still has a place in history.

Please let me know if you have any thoughts or feedback on this that I can incorporate into the next post in the series. Thanks!",nbadiscussion
1420,425,Did the Lakers effectively bid against themselves?,"I look at the trade and I can't wrap my head around the pick control and the amount of picks. The players alone plus maybe one pick(this years) would have beat out all other teams it seems like. Who could have come close to that? Boston would not go all in on a rental like that and NYK just doesn't have the assets. Still think that it's a good move for the Lakers, but all the assets to a New Orleans team with limited trade options doesn't make sense to me. Seems like just a fantastic win for New Orleans (outside of keeping him which was off the table). Someone please explain why I am wrong here.",nbadiscussion
1421,426,Why don't the 76ers go after a Beal trade,"If the 76ers lose in the first or second round again this year, doesn't it warrant a trade of either Simmons or Embiid. I know both are generational talents, but 3 straight years of underperforming in the playoffs is just inexcusable. However, by trading for Beal, you get a high volume scorer that could close out games, which is extremely valuable for the playoffs. As well, you could also get another valuable piece like Bertans or a pick.  I'm leaning towards trading Embiid since he's injury prone and the sixers would be without a pg if they trade Simmons. Plus, I think Simmons becomes much better when there is no one clogging the paint.",nbadiscussion

Mine is Al Horford moving to the 76'ers and him leaving the Celtics. I remember a lot of people claiming that Boston has no bigs now and wouldn't be that good but they're having a pretty good season.

1424,429,Is it time to update team rules for FIBA world cup?,"I'm not going to into depth about why it happened. I'm just curious about how Team USA can prevent it from happening again. It is becoming painfully obvious that NBA players aren't taking the FIBA world cup seriously anymore. They'll still show up for the olympics, because, hey, every young athlete has at least a secret dream of an Olympic gold medal. Yet, the big names just refuse to turn up for the FIBA world cup.

Not only is it incredibly embarrassing that a nation of such basketball talent like the US didn't even medal, but it is also incredibly dangerous. Team USA easily could have slipped further and ended up having to do a play in tournament right as the NBA Playoffs start just to qualify for the Olympics. You want to talk about the worst case scenario? There you go, scrambling a team together of guys who missed the playoffs like 5 days before a tournament begins so we can make the Olympics, yikes.

My proposal is pretty simple. Give guys who play on the FIBA world cup team right of first refusal to be on the Olympic team. That way if a guy wants to play in the Olympics, then he knows the only way to ensure that is to play in the FIBA World cup. Want the exposure of playing in the Olympics, the glory, the unreplaceable experience, then earn it by grinding in the FIBA world cup. This will also increase continuity of the team from world cup to the olympics, reducing the chance of a major upset on an even larger stage. I think having the experience of an entire high stakes tournament of playing together is going to be way better than marginally increased star power. Team USA is starting to play against NBA quality players who in some case have a decade or more of teamwork and synergy under their belt. I legitimately don't believe a new team of mercenary random guys every 2 years will cut it anymore.

Obviously this causes a problem for young players who might not have even been in the league yet. Maybe reserve 2 spots on the roster for under 22 players.",nbadiscussion
1425,430,The CBA's rules for traded player salary-cap exceptions are weirder than you think. Here's a worked example.,"The gist of this all is that teams involved in a trade do *not* have to agree on what exceptions they're using. They are even allowed to structure a trade in a way that the other teams would not be allowed to accept. All that matters is that they acquire players in an allowed manner - the way in which the other team(s) acquire the traded away players is handled separately by the acquiring team.

There are two types of trades: simultaneous and non-simultaneous. Simultaneous trades can aggregate any number of players on each side of the trade, so long as you are acquiring no more than 125% of the salary you give up, plus $100k. The first half of a non-simultaneous trade can only get rid of *exactly one* player, and doing so grants a one-year right to trade for one or more players with a combined salary of up to $100k + the departing player's salary.

So, for this instance, we'll take a look at a potential Mavericks/Timberwolves trade. [Covington + Dieng for Lee + Jackson + Brunson](https://tradenba.com/trades/o7VjisV7U). It's interesting to me because both teams can structure the deal differently, allowing the Wolves to start a non-simultaneous trade.

The Mavericks side of things is pretty straightforward: Dieng (16.2m) gets acquired by trading away Lee (12.7m), Jackson (3.2m), and Brunson (1.4m) in a simultaneous trade. Covington (11.3m) fits neatly into the remaining Traded Player Exception (11.8m) from the Mavs' previous Barnes trade.

On the Wolves side, they're flipping things. Lee (12.7m) and Brunson (1.4m) are still acquired in a simultaneous trade, but this is for Covington (11.3m), not Dieng. This barely fits under the 125% + $100k, and leaves a salary mismatch for the non-simultaneous half of things: acquire Jackson (3.2m) for Dieng (16.2m), granting a future TPE to acquire up to 13.1m worth of players. The Mavs don't have an exception to acquire Dieng for Jackson, but this is completely irrelevant since the teams need only find *a* justification for their acquisitions, not *the same* justification as their trade partners.",nbadiscussion
1426,431,The effects of a shortened offseason.,"Game 7 for the NBA Finals is supposed to be October 12, with free agency starting six days later. Then on Nov. 10, training camps is supposed to start. I think this off-season will be one of the most interesting off-seasons we could see. For starters, the salary cap may end up freezing, and the finances off all the teams will be affected. Then the short free agent period may end up causing less movement.

We have already seen the effects already, when the Bulls retained Jim Boylen as head coach due to the pandemic's effects of economics. Will we see more teams with coaches on the hot seat retain their coaches due to the pandemic? What happens to players like Brandon Ingram, who is a restricted free agent, or players like Bam Adebayo and Donovan Mitchell, who are avaliable for a rookie scale contract extension?",nbadiscussion
1427,432,What makes some three-guard lineups work and others fail?,"PHX's Dragic/Bledsoe/IT lineup was universally panned as not just ineffective but also silly to try in the first place. 

Compare that with Houston's Westbrook/Harden/Gordon lineup or OKC's CP3/Schroeder/SGA lineup. OKC's lineup got a lot of praise especially for late-game shot creation, while Houston's whole small ball approach seems relatively well received, even if that's being tested right now. 

Some ideas to consider: 

size? (the PHX lineup is pretty small but so is OKC's) 

skill? (HOU's is pretty elite in this department, but PHX doesn't stand out as being particularly unskilled)

coaching? Hornacek vs. D'antoni vs. Donavan? D'antoni seems head and shoulders above the other two to me. 

Please introduce other three-guard lineups into the conversation, these were just the three that came to my mind. How does a team do this well/How often should a team do it?",nbadiscussion
1428,433,How is Joel Embiid's perimeter defense?,"Of course Joel Embiid excels as a rim protector. But how capable is Embiid as a defender beyond the arc?  I'm trying to find some tapes that are focused on this aspect of his game, but I can't find anything. I was wondering because switchability for centers is always seen as key nowadays. Does anyone have a specific video? If not, I'm open to anyone watching him expressing his thoughts.",nbadiscussion
1429,434,Is there a shot chart that shows where a player starts with the ball and draws a line to where they take their shot?,"Looking at Zion's shot chart from his 12/13 performance made me think about how showing where a player attempted a shot doesn't tell you enough about what they did when they received the ball. Is the player a catch and shoot player or a slasher? Where does the player like to start with the ball - does he need it in the paint or does he like to drive from the top of the key? I think it would provide a lot of additional context to how the player plays. 

This would definitely be helpful game to game and I think could create a cool visualization for a season of shots. What do you all think?",nbadiscussion

1431,436,The Nets are parting ways with HC Kenny Atkinson.,"The Nets and Atkinson have “mutually agreed to part ways” and both “felt that they had run their course together”. Brooklyn has promoted Jacque Vaughn to Interim Head Coach, who was the Head Coach of the Orlando Magic from 2012 to 2015 before being fired 52 games into the season. Vaughn is 58-158 (.269) in 216 games as a head coach, Kenny Atkinson’s record as a head coach is 118-190 (.383) And was in his fourth season as Nets Head Coach.

Where will Atkinson end up now that he’s most likely the most experienced coach available after helping drive Brooklyn out of their dark ages, And who should the Nets target to try and replace him?

1437,442,Where does the 1999 NBA draft rank all time?,"Where do you guys see the 99 draft all time? 

Some notable players include Elton Brand, Steve Francis, Baron Davis, Lamar Odom, Wally Szczerbiak, Richard Hamilton, Shawn Marion, Andre Miller, Jason Terry, Corey Maggette, Ron Artest, Andrei Kirilenko and Manu Ginobli (2nd last pick of the draft!). Raja Bell also came into the NBA undrafted that year and European legend Theodoros Papaloukas was in the class, though he never played in the NBA.

There's not a lot of super superstar players in this draft, just a remarkable amount of very strong-solid players who were important contributers on championship winning teams (Ginobli, Hamilton, Marion, the Jet, Artest).  Baron Davis was also a baller on the we believe warriors and AK47 was ahead of his time being such a versatile defender and offensive threat and debatably a top 10 player in the 2003/4 season. 

I feel like this draft is hanging around at the edge of top 5 all-time with 1985 and 87, but I'm not sure if I could rank it over the star power of drafts like 03, 96, or 84 and the number of hall of famer's and MVPs that came from those drafts.

Larry Bird

Bill
Lebron

Larry Bird
Stephen Curry

- Box Creation = SHOT CREATION,  --- **""an estimate for the number of open shots created for teammates (per 100 possessions)"".** Box Creation attempts to correct for ""Rondo Assists"" ---  see methodology [**here**](https://fansided.com/2017/08/11/nylon-calculus-measuring-creation-box-score/) by Ben Taylor

- - **Formula**: https://i.imgur.com/nw9SJkb.png  

- - **Note 1**: The highest Box Creation of all-time goes to Russell Westbrook's 2017 season: an insane **21.2 Box Creation** ***(15.9 per 75)***; a few other historical examples  --- '07 Nash: 17.7 *(13.3 per 75)*; '95 Stockton: 16.1 *(12.1 per 75)*; '90 Magic: 16.0 *(12.0 per 75)*; '16 Curry: 15.8 *(11.9 per 75)*

- - **Note 2**: Generally, players who blend both **scoring** AND **passing** well will have great Box Creation numbers - it's the combination of **both** that puts the most pressure on defenses

- - **Note 3**:

> *... And I find this to be one of the most fundamental and fascinating components of basketball — too much scoring (low assist numbers) means a player isn’t creating for others that much, and too much passing (low scoring numbers) means a player isn’t creating for others either! Instead, he must achieve an equilibrium, in which he threatens the defense enough to score himself, but also keeps them honest with passing. I discuss this and its impact on offense in great length in Thinking Basketball if you want to dive further into the how and why.*

- - **Note 4**: In the table below, I've listed Box Creation multiplied by a factor of 0.75 (since BC is a 'per100' stat), to give ""per 75"" values that are more directly comparable to assists/game (since most modern high-volume playmakers use around 75 possessions in a game)



#""Passer Rating"", designed by Ben Taylor

- Passer Rating = **1-10 scale of PASSING ABILITY** 

- - **Formula**: Incorporates i)*Layup assist percentage* (since 2002), ii)*Offensive Load*, iii)*Assist-to-Load ratio (per 100)*, iv)*Non-3 Creation-to-Load ratio*, v)*Height*, and vi)*Turnovers^2* 

- -  **Note 1**: The only player to have a ""perfect"" passer rating was Magic Johnson, in the playoffs (10.0; he achieved this mark 7 times); 2006 Steve Nash was a 9.6

- - **Note 2**: Passer Rating isn't necessarily ""volume-dependent""; efficient, low-turnover passers like Marc Gasol can have sky-high Passer Ratings despite low Assists/Game numbers

- - **Note 3**: Passer Rating likes layup-assists

- - (**Note 4**: Personal rule-of-thumb --- Passer rating ≥9 = rarefied air; ≥8 = ~top 20-ish passer;  ≥7 = excellent; ≥6 = decent; ≥4-5 = passable-good)

- - Note 5: The scale is not linear: it's much much harder to go from, say, an 8 to a 9, than it is to go from a 5 to a 6

1440,445,Where will Dame rank all time when he retires?,"Blazer fan here, just wondering what the general consensus on Dame's legacy is. I think he's going to be one of the guys who's legacy greatly varies on whether he wins a chip or not, more so than guys like Westbrook or CP3. I think if he keeps up (with slight drop offs bc I don't expect 34 year old dame to be dropping 29 a night) the current level of production for 4-5 more years with a couple conference finals runs he has a case for top 15 point guard all time, and if he manages to win a chip within that time I can definitely see him breaking in to top 50 territory.

1442,447,[OC] Biomechanics film study: Breaking down Luka Doncic’s step-back jumper,"[https://youtu.be/762ud2Ft1ZM](https://youtu.be/762ud2Ft1ZM)

Hey ya’ll - I know we’re all starving for some NBA but figured I’d use this time to break down key biomechanics and moves of specific players. The first one is on Luka Doncic’s step-back jumper that he uses to devastating effect. This is a new segment so please chime in with pain points and possible improvements.

Here’s a table of contents:

\- 0:00 Intro

\- 0:23 The breakdown

\- 3:43 Demonstration

Summary (I'll do my best to describe the film breakdown in words): One of Luka's go-to pet moves is his step-back jumper which he frequently uses to create space and good looks for himself. The first key element of the step-back is about controlling space. Luka knows that defenders - especially bigs who are switched onto him (in the video, the clip is Montrezl Harrell on a switch) - can't give him much cushion because the threat of his jumper. That lack of cushion means less margin of error and Luka can manipulate that to his advantage. To do that (referring back to the clip), he sells a hard drive left by plantarflexing his trail (left) ankle, eye level into the pain, and right shoulder dip. This puts Trez into a reaction position and back onto his heels. Luka then - and this is the key part - loads his right leg completely (de-weighting the left) with ankle dorsiflexion, knee flexion, and hip plus trunk flexion. This eccentric loading creates an elastic recoil effect when Luka pushes off the right leg and creates significant space. As Luka goes into his gather, he pre-tensions his right achilles tendon with staying on the forefoot which allows him to quickly load and jump. Overlying all of this is that Luka does this all in rhythm which further facilitates clean motor (movement) patterns.

For those at work or the hard of hearing, I've transcribed subtitles on YouTube so sound isn't required.

1445,450,Are we sure the Lakers young core is as good as everyone thinks it is?,"For a couple of years now, I have believed that the Lakers young core is overrated by the media and the average NBA fan. Below I have typed up reasons why I believe that Ball, Ingram, and Kuzma are overrated relative to their actual abilities and potential ceilings. 

Lonzo Ball:

We know that Lonzo is a good - possibly elite - passer, and in his two seasons in the NBA he has shown flashes of being a good defender. But, I believe that a good-to-elite passer and average-to-good defender is more than likely all he will ever be. That is not a bad thing by any means. Good passers and good defenders will always have a place in the NBA. Lonzo's passing ability and natural instincts already put him in the upper echelon of passers in the NBA and he could potentially be one of the all time great passers.

My knock on him (and it isn't much of a knock, really) is that he is not, and likely (IMO) never will be, a good scorer in the NBA. Let's look at his numbers. 

Lonzo's 3-point shooting during his one year at UCLA is gradually seeming like more of an anomaly than a true indicator of his shooting ability. Lonzo shot an efficient 40% from deep during his lone season at UCLA. But, like many others, I like to look at free throw % as a reliable indicator of how well someone can shoot or how well they can potentially shoot. His freshman year at UCLA, Lonzo shot 67% from the free throw line on 98 attempts. Like Fallout Boy says, 2 out of 3 ain't bad. 

So far in the NBA, Lonzo is shooting 47% from the free throw line (though he's only taken 85 attempts despite having played nearly double as many minutes as he did in college; his free throw rate has gone down from 28% in college to 11% in the NBA, which is understandable), so it's possible that he's just in a slump. But, if you combine his college numbers with his NBA numbers, he's shooting a measly 57% on 183 free throw attempts, a more than fair sample size. This is another tangent that I wont' go into that much, but opposing defenses are taking away his driving ability and forcing him to shoot, which leads to my next point. 

As everyone knows, Lonzo has a pretty ugly shooting form. It's like the 'Tim Tebow throwing motion' of the NBA. He has a slow wind up and shoots with his arms out in front of him rather than at or above head level like most shooters. This makes his shot easy to defend for defenders with any sort of wingspan and manageable for players with minimal wingspans. His athletic ability also isn't head and shoulders above his peers in the NBA like it was in college, making it more difficult for him to create space, as well as get buckets in the lane like I alluded to earlier. 

So far in his NBA career, Lonzo is shooting 31.5% from deep on 375 attempts, which I believe to be a true reflection of his shooting ability, not his outlier stats from his year at UCLA. Another negative is that 52% (over half!) of his shots in the NBA have come from outside the arc. He's shooting 51% from within three feet, so when he does get to the basket he converts a little more than half the time and is defended/blocked almost the every other time, as his low free throw rate indicates. So while he's effective in close range, he's taking way too many threes for that to matter. 

There are some big ""if's"" for Lonzo. If he can improve his shooting motion and make it more difficult to defend, then he theoretically could become a good shooter. But his shot right now just doesn't cut it. It's a lot to ask of a player to change his motion after nearly 20 years of using it, but that's what it will take. Improving his shot will make defenders creep up on him which he can use to his advantage by using his speed and quickness to get past defenders and into the paint where he's been a pretty decent finisher.

In summation: Lonzo is not and will not be a good shooter in the NBA unless he drastically improves his shooting form, which is unlikely. That does not mean that he can't or won't be a great NBA player. Like I said above he has elite passing talent and that likely won't go away anytime soon. He's also an average defender. Combine those two elements and you have a good basketball player, but probably not a perennial (or even one-time) all-star. Again, he is a good basketball player, but he is not a scorer and never will be unless he fixes his shot. I think that his ceiling as it stands is Rajon Rondo, who is a great player, or a poor man's Jason Kidd. Again, those are great comps, but he isn't the all around star like people like to think he is. 

Next!

Brandon Ingram:

Brandon Ingram is tall and very skilled for his size, which is why he was taken #2 overall, garnered years worth of Kevin Durant comparisons, and was in the discussion for the #1 pick over Ben Simmons a few years ago. 

Let's look at that comparison real quick. In Kevin Durant's one season at Texas, he solidified himself as one of the most dynamic scorers ever seen in college hoops and one of the all-time greats despite playing just one season. Durant shot 40% from deep on 6 attempts per game that year and 82% from the free throw line on just over 7 attempts per game. Those are good numbers. Overall, Durant averaged 25 points per game on 47% shooting from the field. Unlike Lonzo's stats I mentioned above, Durant's three point percentage correlates to his free throw percentage, which was a good predictor of how good of a shooter he has turned out to be.  

Brandon Ingram in his lone season at Duke hardly lit the world on fire. While he did shoot 41% from deep that year, better than Durant's percentage, he only shot 68% from the free throw line on 5 attempts per game. Overall he averaged 17 points per game on 44% shooting from the field. Fine numbers, but not elite by any means and certainly not comparable to Durant's freshman season. On the defensive end, Ingram averaged 1 defensive win share and 3.5 on offense, while Durant averaged 4.1 on defense and 4.7 on offense. 

But back to the crux of my argument: free throw % as an indicator of shooting ability. His freshman year at Duke, Ingram shot in the 68% from the line. His free throw mediocrity has since carried over to the NBA, where he’s averaged 65% from the line over the course of 564 attempts in his 2+ seasons. 

So, as data would suggest, Ingram's 3pt% this season and his rookie season has regressed to where it should be for someone with his shooting ability, in the low-30's. Ingram is a scorer, but the issue here is that he hasn’t been all that good at it and is pretty inefficient. IN FACT, he has a negative offensive win-share, meaning his offense actually HURTS his team when he’s on the floor. Ingram is still young, and can and will likely increase his efficiency, but history suggests that he isn't more than an average scorer and below average shooter. To his credit, Ingram doesn't shoot predominately from any specific range and spreads his attempts out pretty well. 31% of his shots come at the basket where he converts 63%, a great number. However, 23% of his shots come from midrange, where he's only shot 36% for his career, a very poor number. He actually shoots the least from three, which is understandable since it's his worst area, averaging 33% from deep in his career. So at least he has some awareness of his strengths and weaknesses, aside from that midrange issue. 

Frankly, if you compare him to his similarly-aged peers, Ingram is nothing special. He's just... well, fine. He's fine. Again, he's not a bad NBA player necessarily, despite having a career negative OWS, but he isn't great, and likely never will be. He can be a role player on a good team, someone you can have guard lengthy wings, get to the basket and score from there efficiently, and shoot an occasional three, but that's probably it. Those who act like he's the next Durant or Giannis or even Paul George need to take a closer look. 

Kyle Kuzma: 

Lastly, Kyle Kuzma. Kuzma played three years at Utah, which I think most CBB fans would agree is an average-to-mediocre basketball program. In his time there, Kuzma averaged 3, 10, and 16 points in his freshman, sophomore, and junior seasons respectively. Those are decent numbers and not bad for college ball, but nothing fancy, granted no one really acts like he was some amazing All American at Utah, so this might be a moot point.

During his career as a Ute, Kuzma averaged 30% from deep and 63% from the free throw line overall, though he increased his FT% each season; his 3pt% did not follow the same trend, going from 32 to 25 and back to 32. Looking at his win-shares, he totaled 4.7 on offense and 3.5 on defense in 96 career games, not bad, but remember that Ingram and Durant put up more win-shares despite only playing in a third of the amount of games Kuzma did.

I'll give credit where credits due, Kuzma definitely had a good rookie year. He averaged 16ppg on 36% 3pt shooting and 70% from the line. His free throw % continued its upward trend from college, which may indicate that he will continue to work on and improve his shot, which is obviously a good sign.

Despite his yearly free throw % progression, his 3p% has not done the same. It went from bad to worse to bad again in college (32 to 25 to 32) before taking a big leap his rookie season. But, this year, he's come back down to earth, or to Utah I guess you could say. He's shooting 29% on 5 attempts per game in 20 games, which means he's made about 29 of 100. Not a good number, yet a decent sample size. This number is obviously much more similar to his college 3pt numbers, which were bad. 

Unlike Ingram or Lonzo, Kuzma is not a freak athlete, which is likley why he was playing at Utah in the first place and not at Kentucky or UCLA or Duke. He’s a solid-to-good basketball player, but with his athletic limitations and history of a mediocre jump shot, he’ll likely never be a star. He’s actually a decent defender, with a positive w/s, but it isn’t anything spectacular. Based on his improvements at the free throw line and decent defending despite his somewhat limited (relatively) athleticism, his numbers indicate he works hard and can be expected to improve in some areas, so that’s a plus. That being said, I can't imagine he’ll ever be more than a role player/solid starter. At best, I can see him having a similar career to Tobias Harris except with worse shooting. Meaning, in a given season in his prime he can average anywhere from 12-18ppg and give you decent defense and good hustle. 

So, that concludes my thoughts on the Lakers youth. But there is one thing I did not say that I will bring up now: LeBron changes everything. LeBron dragged last year's corpse of a Cavs team to the finals so it's totally possible LeBron could win one with these guys, though if he does then that means they likely traded for or signed a star in free agency to pair alongside him.

My main argument and the one thing I want you to remember is that this core, as it stands alone with its own merits and talent level separate from LeBron James or Kawhi or whoever ends up in LA, is not and will not be much more than average. 

That concludes my essay and argument.

1446,451,Brandon Clarke has been amazingly efficient in his rookie campaign,"Brandon Clarke has averaged 12/6 coming of the bench while being a plus defender for Memphis this year. Clarke leads all rookies in TS% and eFG% while being top 5 among all NBA players in those categories. He's shot 78.6% at the rim (10th in the league, 1st among rookies). Also he's been amazing from behind the arc at 38.2% (granted on volume but still very impressive). He's also very athletic and has room to grow in creating his own shot which would elevate his current value even more as a player. I think he'll the 3rd best rookie of his 2019 draft class behind Ja Morant and Zion and he'll be a big piece for the future of this Grizzlies team.",nbadiscussion
1447,452,A guide to WhatIfSports NBA simulation. Warning: this isn't for everyone. It's for the nerds. It's like Magic The Gathering or D&D for the NBA,"I asked for permission from the mods and it was granted prior to posting this. This is my favorite website and we could use a few more members. 

&#x200B;

In short, the website has a database of every season of every NBA&ABA player ever - and each season of each player is assigned a salary. You are working within a salary cap and you get to build a 12 man roster to compete in a simulated season of 82 simulated games (plus playoffs) against other teams within a league. You can set your starters/bench, target minutes for each player, coaching preferences and make slight opponent adjustments, but most of it comes down to how well you drafted...however, it gets way more advanced the deeper you dive.

&#x200B;

Users have taken to the forums to create custom ""theme"" leagues, and this is where it gets really fun IMO. Heads up: leagues do cost. You can win free or discounted seasons by making the playoffs and winning playoff rounds - and one season lasts about 1 month in the forum (drafting/trading/etc) and about 2 months in the SIM. Types of different leagues that exist:

**Progressive leagues:** These leagues work a lot like running a real-life team as a GM. When the league is founded, the commissioner picks a starting year (lets use 1979 as an example) and all 24 owners go through a huge draft to draft every player who existed in that year. For this type of league, you'll want to value the player as a whole including their age - as in how many years they have left in their career and how many of those are good seasons. After you draft your 12-man squad for the inaugural season, the season runs as normal (82 simulated games where you make some settings and preference adjustments) plus playoffs and eventually a champion. In the ""offseason"" there is a lottery, a draft of all incoming players (so since this hypothetical league started in 79-80, the draft would be for all players who debuted in 80-81), trades can be made between teams and then you can drop anyone and add a FA after the draft - all done within the forums. These leagues are fun because they go year after year with mostly the same group of owners and you can plan for the future, tank, retool, keep trading your late firsts to try to keep your contender alive...whatever you would like to do as GM. I've got a team right now that is in the 09-10 season and I have rookie Harden, young Mike Conley, Andrew Bynum and Nic Batum and I am tanking for one more year before I start making a decade long push for contention. It's pretty fun to try to trade and draft your way in to contention. These forums are hidden and you have to be a member of the league to see them. 

&#x200B;

**Draft leagues:** These are one-off leagues that revolve around a big draft. A salary cap is set prior to the draft (some are low-cap and challenging, some are a higher cap) and the player pool is determined (most drafts have every player ever available, but some run for a certain decade of players or even just one real-life NBA season). No duplicates are allowed, meaning that when someone drafts Steph Curry, they can only use one season of him and no one else can use any Steph Currys. There is usually a snake-order draft or something similar. These are really fun and challenging. The season runs as normal using the drafted teams. Here is the most recent draft: [https://www.whatifsports.com/forums/Posts.aspx?topicID=514047](https://www.whatifsports.com/forums/Posts.aspx?topicID=514047&TopicsTimeframe=365)

&#x200B;

There are also other leagues people have created that have very unique rules. One league I am in you own 12 players but the season you get from them is random (between all possible years of there career) and then you lose 2 random players each season and those players make up the next draft class. It's interesting because you have to factor in a player's whole career (like MJ's MIA seasons) when valuing players for trades and drafting.

**Open leagues:** These are run by the website and anyone can simply enter any team with no real rules aside from a salary cap. This might be a good place to start but it's certainly not the most fun.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**So how does it work?**

The SIM uses players real life stats to determine outcomes of each possession of a game. There is stamina that is based on how many minutes that player played in real life. All stats are based on %s, which helps compare eras better. Don't focus on things like PPG - you want to instead look at that player's usage % to see how often he shot/got fouled/turned the ball over per 100 possessions, and then his eFG% to see how efficiently he scored on that usage. Drafting too much usage will lead to losses, simply because usage factors in to the player's salary (you're paying for it) and if you draft 6 guys that all need 25 shots a game, they're not going to all get their touches but you will have paid for those touches you never got. It's better to draft a couple of high usage/high efficiency guys and use the rest of your money on rebounding, passing, defense, etc...

&#x200B;

You'll want to not focus so much on the name-value of the player and instead focus on the numbers they give you. Allen Iverson isn't very good in this game. Richaun Holmes is. Speaking of Richaun Holmes, you'll want to look at ""position effectiveness"". It will tell you how effective a player is at all 5 positions. Some of it is common sense. You don't want to play Shaq at SG. Some of it is a little weird but you can use it to your advantage. Lots of real life PFs like Dennis Rodman, Elton Brand, Serge Ibaka, Richaun Holmes, Horace Grant are 100% effective at SF for some reason. If you can live with their lack of 3s (by drafting guys like Steph who give you an abundance) then putting one of these guys at SF with 2 true big men at PF and C can give you a big rebounding advantage. 

&#x200B;

You'll want to draft enough 3s (I aim for at least 400 3PM for a season based on my drafted players' real-life stats) so that your opponent doesn't pack the paint on you. Defense is important and if you do it right, you can draft 3 good defenders who can ""switch"" with your bad ones (like a good defensive player who is 95%+ at PG and SG and a bad defensive player who is 95%+ at PG and SG).

If you want to jump in to a theme league, this would probably be a good start. You simply comment with the name of a franchise that hasn't been claimed yet and over the next week or so just build the best 12-man squad you can from players who played for that franchise, under the salary cap the commissioner set. Then you'll compete against others who did the same.

1448,453,Which team is hurt most by an injury to a non-star player?,"The post in r/NBA about Harden and Westbrook not yet being present in the Disney World bubble and a comment on that post about how the Rockets don't have much to practice offensively got me thinking about what they would do if they were missing one of their players. Obviously an injury to Harden or Russ would hurt Houston a lot, but one could largely pick up the slack for the other in a series, ignoring fatigue and Russ being a non-shooter. Then I thought to myself that an injury to  Covington or Tucker could be just as devastating to Houston as an injury to one of their stars. They don't have any other NBA-caliber ""big men"" unless I forgot someone, and I don't know how they guard anyone or space the floor for Harden and Russ if Covington or Tucker miss time.

1449,454,"Larry Bird on Lakers, Magic Johnson on Celtics. Who wins more titles now?","Let's say the Lakers took Larry Bird and Magic Johnson ended up on the Celtics, Who do you think ends up with more Championships and why?

Myself I believe Larry Bird would have cause they would have Kept Norm Nixon to run the point and Michael Cooper would be the Shooting Guard and Bird would be the Small Forward, power forward could have been a weakness depending who filled the slot over the years then of course Kareem at Center. 

Bird could play fast break ball if needed, he was better at half court ball better then Magic and he I believe was getting the best out of players. Now I'm not saying Magic was horrible at those but Bird I believe had a greater will to win.

1450,455,Sixers lack of shot creation,"I think it's clear that there is a glaring issue with the sixers offense and that is the lack of a shot creator.  In their recent game against OKC CP3 and SGA showed how crucial it is to have someone who can run high pick and roll or go 1on1 at a mismatch and get a quality shot. Those two players ability to do that, coupled with the sixers complete inability to, was what won/lost the game last night and has crippled the sixers offense all year. To be clear, by shot creator I mean someone who can create a high quality look either for themselves or their teammates consistently, even during crunch time.

The problem, as I see it is that the sixers built around Ben as a PG, when he is playing the role of a PF (and a 90s era PF at that). This means that they end up effectively having a 2, a 3, two 4s and a 5 on the floor, which is a non-functional lineup.

JRich is a talented player, however he showed in Miami last year that he is not a primary shot creator. Miami gave him the keys to the offense and he wasn't up to the task. That isn't a knock on him, like I said he is a great player but not in that role. If you put him in a position to take open threes and attack close outs he will be very effective. Even if you want him to be a secondary playmaker he can fill that role, but is not a primary shot creator.

You can argue that Tobias has the skills to be a primary shot creator but again I don't think that he is comfortable in that role.  I watch every sixers game and can think of only a handful of plays where he looked confident attacking a mismatch.  He is comfortable in the post against smaller players, but I don't think post ups are reliable enough in crunch time to consistently create good looks   I feel like he is best suited to be the screener in a high pick and roll than the ball handler.  Setting the screen, he can pick and pop or roll and get the looks he's most efficient at.

Joel Embiid can get his own shot, but still really struggles with double teams and his decision making generally. Again, he is an incredible talent but isn't ready or able to be relied on to consistently make the right decision. Like Tobi, I feel like he would be better as the screener, especially with his improved three point shooting. You want him in a position to think as little as possible and either shoot the open jumper or drive and finish, i.e. his main strengths.

All of which brings me to Ben Simmons. In order for the offense to function he needs to start taking shots. All we heard all off season is how much he worked on his shot and ""if it's open I'll take it"". Now is the time to prove it.  Currently every non-transition possession starts with him handing the ball off and moving to the dunkers spot or attempting a post up, both of which make the offense worse.  Either by clogging the lane making it more difficult for other post players, i.e. Embiid or Tobi, or taking post up opportunities away from the same players, who score more efficiently in those situations.  To illustrate this, Embiid currently is among lead leaders the in points per possession on post ups at 1.15, Tobias is at a respectable 0.89 (KAT is at 0.90) and Simmons is at 0.52.

Not only is he negatively effecting the players around him but by playing off ball he is unable to use the talents that make him such a special player: his athleticism, handle and passing.

If he continues to refuse to play as a true PG the sixers struggles will continue.  In my opinion he should be running *at least* 15 high pick and rolls a game and should take whatever shots he is given, most likely pull up 12-15 footers.  Until that happens I don't see any hope for a marked improvement either in his play or the team's.

I do believe that part of the blame lies with Brett for two reasons.  One because it's his job to force Simmons to take these shots.  Again, all off season we heard that Ben was going to shoot, would be taking corner threes instead of hanging out in the dunkers spot and none of that has happened.  The other is that Brett seems obsessed with not running pick and rolls, which just seems asinine at this point.  There is a very good reason why basically every other NBA offense is based around the PnR and his continued campaign to try to be different is borderline ridiculous now.

My desire is for the sixers to start actually realizing the incredible potential they has and in my opinion that won't happen until Ben plays as a PG and actually shoots the ball.",nbadiscussion
1451,456,Why Russell Westbrook deserved his MVP,"It's been a hotly contested debate about who truly deserved the 2016-17 MVP. Although some say that the winner, Russell Westbrook, was awarded properly. You also have a certain amount of people who suggest Harden was more deserving due to having the small edge on Westbrook in terms of efficiency and an advantage in the W/L column.

Over the years, a small group of people have suggested Leonard deserved it over both due to him having an even bigger advantage over the 2 in efficiency, team record, and defense. And of course, you'll have the group that suggest LeBron James. Not much needs to be added there. 

I disagree. Firstly, take a look at the numbers below. Westbrook leads all of the other candidates in nearly every recorded statistic.

31 blocks **(126th)** | 38 blocks **(97th)** | 55 blocks **(51st)** | 44 blocks **(68th)**

Next, let's take a look at the candidates' 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th options. As you'll come to see, James without a doubt has the best producing supporting cast. 

#Supporting cast
Westbrook | Harden | Leonard | James 
---------|----------|----------|----------
Oladipo: 15.9/4.3/2.6 | Gordon: 16.1/2.7/2.5 |  Aldridge: 17.3/7.2/1.9 | Irving: 25.2/3.2/5.8
Kanter: 14.3/6.7/0.9 | Anderson: 13.6/4.6/0.9 | Gasol: 12.4/7.8/2.3 | Love: 19.1/11/1.9
Adams: 11.3/7.7/1.1 | Capela: 12.6/8.1/1.2 | Parker: 10.1/1.8/4.5 | Korver: 10.6/2.6/2.7
Gibson: 9.0/4.5/0.7 | Ariza: 11.7/5.7/2.2 | Mills: 9.5/1.8/3.5 | Frye: 9.1/3.9/0.6

*Stats are in the order of PTS/REB/AST*

And as you can see, Westbrook has the least productive supporting cast. Not only that, but the Thunder were also constructed poorly. Which is why they ranked 26th in 3-pointers made per game and 30th overall in 3PT%, virtually no sort of spacing or 3-point shooter. 

Whereas LeBron James and James Harden had teams built to fit their needs. Shooters that could attract attention, unlock the paint, and open up the floor. 

Lastly, let's take a look at the candidates' clutch performance:

#Clutch statistics 
Westbrook | Harden | Leonard | James 
---------|----------|----------|----------
6.2 PPG **(1st)** | 3.8 PPG **(10th)** | 3.7 PPG **(12th)** | 3.2 PPG **(22nd)**
2.1 FGM **(1st)** | 0.8 FGM **(25th)** | 1.0 FGM **(13th)** | 1.0 FGM **(16th)**
4.6 FGA **(1st)** | 2.4 FGA **(15th)** | 2.6 FGA **(11th)** | 1.9 FGA **(28th)**
44.6 FG% | 35.5 FG% | 40.0 FG% | 53.0 FG%
32.8 3PT% | 27.3 3PT% | 23.8 3PT% | 48.4 3PT%

Statistically speaking, Westbrook was the most clutch player out of any MVP candidate and shot better than Harden and Leonard in the clutch, only outdone by LeBron James. 

A lot of people have stated that Westbrook only won because he averaged a triple-double, and quite frankly, they're right. Which is unfortunate because if you do the research and look at non-counting stats you'd see that his season was much more than the triple-double average. 

So this concludes why I think Westbrook deserved his MVP. He was just so dominant in every statistical category, was oddly efficient and effective in the clutch, and also averaged a triple-double for only the 2nd time in NBA history which ultimately won over the voters.

Edit: Also, to touch on the fact that Westbrook had won the award after winning 47 games. There have been a select few to win the award despite less than stellar records. The players to win MVP despite their teams winning 50 or fewer ganes were Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan, Moses Malone twice, and Bob Petit. 

We forget that there have been numerous MVP candidates that had nearly won the award despite winning roughly the same amount of games Westbrook's Thunder did. For example: LeBron James in 2006 and 2018 finished 2nd in voting despite Cleveland winning 50 games, Dwight Howard finished 2nd in voting after his Magic won 51 games, etc.",nbadiscussion
1452,457,Will the Clippers be hampered by their lack of elite passers?,"Hey guys, Kawhi isn't a bad passer and PG is fairly good, but one of the criticisms levelled at the Clips is that they will be lacking that final playmaking spark to elevate them to title contention. And considering who PG/Kawhi were teamed up with last year, it does make sense: Beverley is a ferocious defender and an excellent shooter, but not up to Lowry or Westbrook in the floor general department. And while PG13 didn't have an elite passer in Indiana and still experienced regular and post season success, that was in a much weaker conference.

Then again, both PG and Kawhi are excellent Iso players who will generate a good bit of gravity, and while it may make sense to double or trap them (seeing as they run a good bit of PnR too), that gravity combined with the Clippers' shooters like Pat Bev, Lou and Shamet will lead to many advantageous situations where the defense will be left to pick its poison. So to some degree, having two complete threats on offense who are, at the very least, not black holes on offense, will probably reduce the importance of a CP3 type disher a bit.

Where do you guys stand on this? Will the Clips be a top tier offense regardless of said roster flaw?",nbadiscussion
1453,458,Where Does John Stockton Rank Among All-Time Point Guards?,"I ask because I think John Stockton is criminally underrated. I don't obsess over stats, but to a certain extent numbers don't lie. He's the all-time leader by far in both career assists and steals, with career shooting percentage above 50% and above average percentages from the three point and free throw lines as well. Yet somehow he seems to not ever be mentioned among all-time greats at his position. 

Yes I know he never won a title, but he reached the finals twice and lost to Michael Jordan's Bulls both times - who are obviously among the greatest championship teams of all time. Unless we're going to say the same thing about other guys who were blocked by Jordan from titles like Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkley, Gary Payton, Reggie Miller and Karl Malone, I don't think Stockton's lack of a title can be used against him in the all-time debate. 

So objectively where does he rank? 

My point guard list looks like this: 

1. Magic Johnson
2. Stephen Curry
3. Gary Payton
4. John Stockton

I'm finding it really hard to name more than 3 guys I'd definitely take over Stockton, though I acknowledge there are a ton of guys who'd have strong arguments. Steve Nash won two MVPs (though at least one of them is highly questionable) and he helped revolutionize the game. Isiah Thomas (the older/original one) is heavily underrated as well. 

I really think the only thing Stockton's game lacked is a certain ability to elevate. He could do everything the team needed, *except* go off for 40 points. And at the end of the day, getting more buckets is what it's all about. But still, Chris Paul probably fits the same profile, so modest scoring abilities isn't a disqualifier either. 

I can't see how Stockton is not a Top 5 point guard all-time, easily. Am I missing something?",nbadiscussion
1454,459,Some stray thoughts on Lonzo Ball,"It's quite amusing that this version of Lonzo is now a legitimately decent, rotation-level NBA player. His strengths are, ironically enough, exactly what the Lakers need this season, and are what will allow him to be increasingly scale-able on better and better teams. He's a legitimate good shooter now, at least on catch-and-shoot (38.3% from 3 on  nearly 7 attempts/game is excellent), his passing/vision remains fantastic, especially in non-half-court settings, and he's a complete pest on defense. He has an almost Draymond-esque quality to his game (obviously to a lower degree than the veritable DPOY/All-Star) where he'll be a good-passable player on an average/below-average team, but he'll function as an excellent talent multiplier on better and better teams, with the spacing, ""network connection"" vision, and defense he provides.

Of course, his scoring game from *literally everywhere else* other than the 3-point-line and the rim (where he's quite impressive for a guard, converting 62% of his attempts, a Westbrook-esque number, though on far fewer attempts) is very limited. 

He's surprisingly poor from the midrange (29 fg%) and floater range (23 fg%), especially given his ability from deep, and his free throw shooting is so poor that he regularly *avoids* contact when getting to the rim- he averages a Klay Thompson-esque 1.2 FTA per game and shoots an Andre Drummond-esque 57 FT%, which is admittedly an improvement from the 44% he averaged his 1st two seasons. (His shot selection, it must be said, limits these issues somewhat - only 21% of his shots don't come at the rim or from 3.)

Therefore, I don't think he will be able to lead an above average offense largely of his own merit just yet, but when playing alongside other lead ball handlers (say, a LeBron, or an Ingram or a Holiday), he's pretty much perfect. The Pelicans have been a legitimately good team since Zion entered the lineup (or prior to that, whenever Favors was on the court, LOL), so I'm glad that more people will start to take more notice of how Lonzo has polished his weaknesses and honed his strengths to the point where he's basically an indispensable part of the Pelicans' starting lineup now.",nbadiscussion

1457,462,LaMelo Ball: Next Season,"Hey guys,

what do you think is gonna happen with LaMelo? Obviously I see him declaring for the draft, but how do you think he'll fare in the NBA? Which team does he go to? Not a big fan of the Ball family but LaMelo has turned out to be better than expected.

1458,463,"If the Jordan Bulls never broke up, who would have eventually beaten them?","Imagine in an alternate universe, Jordan and the Bulls never broke up.  Having won 6 out of 8 championships, and later still showing he can play very well on a Wizards team when he was 40 years old, the Bulls dynasty was given the option to defend their title until they lost it.  Obviously its hard to speculate about possible player rosters, fit, salary, etc., but assuming Krause kept the Bulls mostly intact with Phil, MJ, and Scottie at the helm, here are the actual real life roster moves that would have been impacted:

Jud Buechler, to Detroit Pistons 1999

Scott Burrell, to New Jersey Nets 1999

Ron Harper, to Los Angeles Lakers (part of Lakers championships in 2000 and 2001)

Steve Kerr, to San Antonio Spurs 1999 (part of Spurs championship in 1999)

Scottie Pippin, to Portland Trailblazers 1999

Dennis Rodman, to Los Angeles Lakers 1999

Phil Jackson/Tex Winter, to Los Angeles Lakers 2000 (part of Lakers championships in 2000, 2001, and 2002)

The breakup of the Bulls would contribute to championship teams for the next 4 years.  Assuming those players stay with the Bulls, the Spurs would have to replace Steve Kerr, and the Lakers would have to replace their entire championship coaching staff along with 2 years of Ron Harper.  Of those championship, the ones I remember most are of course from the Lakers, I remember Harper being very good and helped to mentor Derek Fisher, but I recall Fisher hit the big shots and Harper was more there to lead and calm the team down when things got out of hand.  Not to take anything away from Harper, but I think player-wise, the Lakers would have been fine with a different replacement.  Coaching is another thing though.

Out of the East, the Bulls would have had to face a lockout-shortened ECF champs of the Knicks lead by Patrick Ewing in 1999, a Pacers team with Reggie Miller the following year, a Sixers team with the MVP Allen Iverson, COTY Larry Brown, and DPOTY Dikembe Mutombo, and Sixth Man Aaron Mckie in 2001 (the only team to take a win off the 15-1 Lakers and they had to do it in overtime), and a back-to-back ECF winner in the New Jersey Nets lead by Jason Kidd in 2002 and 2003.  

Of course Father Time is unbeaten but the age in which he beats you varies with everyone.  How long could the Bulls have prolonged their championship dynasty?  

I think they would have had a serious threat to lose it the next year against the Spurs.  Of course winning 6 championships in 8 years is super impressive, but it took them 6 games to beat the Jazz and with the exception of Game 3, all the games were won by 5 or less points, that's something I don't think most people remember.  So the Bulls had to get very lucky to eke out their 4 wins against the Jazz, but the Spurs presented them with a different problem.  Their Twin Towers of Duncan and Robinson were going to feast on the center of the Bulls.  In 1999, Dennis Rodman was a shell of his former self, maybe he keeps most of his abilities under another year of harsh MJ guidance, but he only played 23 games for the Lakers when he signed with them that year.  The Bulls were always a guard dominated team, their center was never really that impressive.  I think the Spurs give all they can to the Bulls and it would be a very close series.

No matter how long MJ plays on though, i think he doesn't make it through the Shaq/Kobe teams without a loss.  Yes, Phil was absolutely integral to that team, but what's not mentioned is that Shaq was on a mission in 2000 to win.  That Lakers team went 67-15 in the regular season, I think its top 3 in Lakers all time regular season wins.  Shaq was MVP that year and as we all know, he was the only one to beat MJ during his dynasty run.  Yes, MJ only came back during the middle of the year, but Shaq still beat him.  Now this was MVP Shaq, most dominant ever, whatever MJ could have done against the Twin Towers the previous year, he would have had to face Shaq 3 times and I don't think he wins all 3.  Plus, you've got Kobe, the only guy who MJ said could beat him one-on-one (""cause he stole all my moves!"").  Kobe worships MJ and would likely rise to the challenge facing his idol in the Finals.  Kobe is just as ruthless at MJ was, remember he basically refused to let MJ win by blocking him towards the end of one of the All-Star games, I think he would definitely take his play up a notch.  

I do think MJ makes it out of the East at least in the next 2 years, he's long had Ewing and Miller's numbers.  But Iverson in 2001 I think would be too quick for MJ to handle.  I think a 40 year old MJ definitely would get tired trying to chase AI around the court.  Unless Krause finds a defensive stopper to guard him, and at that point nobody could guard AI, the Bulls team may not even make it to the Finals that year.  

By my count, MJ could have realistically won 1 or 2 more championships if the Bulls remained mostly intact, a possible one against the Spurs, and a less likely but still possible one against the Lakers depending how you feel about their replacement coach, but I think they'd be done by 2001 for sure.  Even MJ couldn't carry the Wizards to a winning record over his time playing with the team, and while he personally was very good, you couldn't win with MJ as your best player in the 2000's anymore.  Even if you assume MJ would be more likely to keep in shape had he not taken a few years off after his last title, it would have been more wear and tear on his knee which kept him out a lot during his Wizards tenure.  So hold your heads up high, Bulls fans, the title would likely have come to a halt the next year or two and MJ wouldn't be thought of as the invincible monster that his reputation has been built on.  Like it or not, Krause breaking up the team probably helped to cement MJ's legacy as never having lost in the Finals.",nbadiscussion
1459,464,KAT has become mad underrated.,"With this 3pt prowess, nuanced postgame, and good to great passing, I rate him as the best offensive center in the NBA. Elaborating on his 3pt shot, it's not just catch & shoot either, he can take it off the dribble, and he can step backs for god's sake. This creates a Curry and Harden like gravity on offense, except he is like 7 feet, so you have to drag your center or pf out to contest that.

I recently went into a debate with a Utah fan, in what seemed to be a Gobert appreciation thread. I was of the opinion, that in no way would Jazz leave a chance to swap Gobert straight up with KAT. I didn't mean to make that comment, but it just came out in the context of the conversation. Fair to say, I was met with vehement opposition.

That made me think, was I really that wrong here? I evaluated KAT to be the 3rd best among young players(After Giannis and Luka) after in both play and value. Every team should kill to have him.

Discuss.

Edit: He has improved with each passing season, and I believe this season's iteration of KAT, if healthy, could influence and win games like Luka and Giannis. He does not have an insanely good team like Giannis to have his back, nor does he has KP and Rick Carlisle, I mean team factors after a certain point don't you think? Unless you are LeBron that is.",nbadiscussion
1460,465,"Is there any chance that a Timberwolves team of KAT, D-Lo, and Booker could ever work/come together?","As we all know, these 3 have been wanting to get on the same team for some time now, but how realistic is it?

First off, the Suns would probably have a hard time trading their franchise player without getting a haul similar to what the Thunder got for PG-13 and Westbrook, which the T-Wolves can’t provide. So for the sake of this exercise, let’s say that Booker demands a trade to the Wolves.

No trade for Booker could be complete without Jarrett Culver, Malik Beasley, Josh Okogie, just about every young player in the roster, and a multitude of picks. Of course, the Wolves have enough salary to make the contracts match (James Johnson, Evan Turner).

So now that Booker is on the team, we need to examine the roster. With 3 max players, the team has very little flexibility. Not to mention the horrendous depth that remains on the team (their 4th best player is probably Jake Layman if he wasn’t put in the trade). In order to fill roster spots, it’s possible that the Wolves would’ve gotten some lower-end Suns players (Jalen Leque, Cameron Payne), but this isn’t much help. Aside from having no bench, there also isn’t much shooting or defense.

Now for the actual strategy that the wolves would enact. D-Lo would handle the ball for the majority of the time, while KAT and Booker would attempt to get open off ball with cuts and screens. Offensively, this team would be great, probably placing in the top-10. However, none of their 3 stars are seen as even neutral defenders currently. If the remaining forward spots aren’t comprised of clear positive defenders (Royce O’Neal, OG Anunoby, etc.) then it’s unlikely your looking at a serious playoff team. In order to deal with the lack of depth or defensive presence in the lineup, Booker or D-Lo might even have to come off the bench.

Post edit: now that I’ve seen what you all think, let me examine what I’ve found.

- if this trade happens, it will probably be because the wolves front office is struggling to keep KAT in minny.
- this isn’t a good trade, it isn’t really conducive to the modern era of offense, where you either do it fairly egalitarian or heliocentric.
- “Booker doesn’t validate the haul I mentioned” I saw that a lot, and I think it’s true in a vacuum. But last off-season established a precedent of franchise players being traded for huge packages in an attempt to smoothly transition to a rebuild, along with many other precedents.",nbadiscussion
1461,466,NBA All-Time Budget Draft,"Over the past several months I have hosted six all-time NBA drafts where you select an individual season of any NBA player available ever for 10 rounds and try to build the best team possible while considering fit/portability and positional value, which has led to results that look unusual on the surface over time. 

After the sixth draft concluded, we decided to take the average draft position of every single player ever drafted and give them an exponential financial valuation where you can draft a 8-player team with a **budget of $100.** We set a cap of $45 for a single player for now but we want to test it out to make it as accurate as possible. Both LeBron and Jordan will cost $45, with a noticeable drop-off afterward due to how highly coveted LeBron and Jordan turned out to be in our drafts, and there not being a clear 3rd best player. 

To test out the accuracy of this, I wanted to let a larger community test it out, so I will post a list below with all the players that are valued at $2 or more, with anyone not on the list being available for $1. 

Keep in mind that these prices are based on exponential values of average draft positions and not my personal opinion, and that this is supposed to be each player at their absolute peak, so longevity is not a factor to be considered in this exercise. List the season of the player you want as well if you’d like. Also you should have **8 roster spots,** which would be an average of $12.5 per player. Another important thing to note is that these prices have been determined before there was a large enough sample size for the 2019-20 season, so please try to **avoid selecting any players in their 2019-20 season.**

I will sort all players by the 5 main positions which can be somewhat subjective but will be better for organization. I will also take suggestions on what prices should change since the way it was determined is obviously not perfect. Keep in mind that players that provide positive defensive value or 3-pt shooting are generally more valued than a player that does not.

1462,467,How much time do we give a young player to develop before we consider them a bust?,"Some players start their NBA careers off strong like Luka Doncic, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony. These players have super high floors and you can tell they have star potential right out the gate.

Some other players start off slower and then eventually break out like Kyle Lowry, Jimmy Butler, Victor Oladipo. They might be bad, good, or average then all of a sudden have a year or two where they completely flip the switch and become a star.

Some players start out super strong but either decline or never improve, such as Tyreke Evans, Michael Carter Williams, Andrew Wiggins.

What are some signs to look for to see if a player is truly a bust, or if they just need development?

How long should we wait for a player to develop before calling them a bust?

**Important Edit:**

After typing this i realize bust may be the wrong word for all cases since it normally applies to players who were high draft picks. But overall i just want to know how long do we give players before we realize their ceilings are lower than expected",nbadiscussion
1463,468,Which historical player would benefit your team(current or all time) the most if added to the team.,"Let’s say you can snatch any player out of nba history and add them to any team. Who are you picking? 

I’m thinking more of who fits the system and plugs the most weaknesses rather than everyone just saying Jordan or LeBron on their favorite team(not because it’s wrong but because it is boring). Also looking more for teams with memorable and unique systems or rosters. Or good teams that never won anything important because of a few major holes or weaknesses. I’m also thinking about what combination of stars would play the best off of each other.

A few examples I thought of off the top of my head would be Bill Russel on the mid 2000s suns. He would transform them into a top defense, start so many fast breaks, Russel was very clutch and a winner, and Nash is kinda like a modern Bob Cousy.  Also Russel would be the perfect foil for Duncan and Nowitzki.

Or for a current one how about Gary Payton on the Clippers. They’d finally get a point guard who can run an offense at an elite level but more importantly they’d become possibly the best defensive team ever. Payton was never a great go to scorer and isn’t remembered as being clutch, but he wouldn’t have to do that here. He’d be able to focus on the things he’s best at, playing defense, and running the offense. He’d fit into small ball lineups very well and give them even more versatility.

And yes, I did get this idea from plying way too much 2k with the classic rosters",nbadiscussion
1464,469,"It took the ABA and NBA a combined 17 years to shoot above .300% as a league from 3 pt, 25 combined years to shoot over .350% as a league","The ABA existed from 1967-76 and utilized the 3 point shot throughout. The NBA implemented the 3 point shot in the 1979-80 season. Through the first 7 years of shooting 3 pt shots, the NBA never averaged above .282 in a season while during the same time frame the ABA never averaged below .283 with twice as many attempts. The NBA got off to a 'hot' start shooting .280 from the three in season one. But the next four years saw the shooting percentage above .25 only once. Then there began a surging that allowed the 3 point shooting percentage to bust through the .300 barrier in 86-87 by ending at .301. Then it was .316 the next season and the .350 level would eventually get broken at the end of the 94-95 season and generally stayed around .350 since then. So it took the NBA 16 seasons to be able to top .350 as a league and topping .350 as a league was something the ABA never did during its nine year existence. So there's a combined twenty-five seasons to break the .350 barrier from the three point line.

1994-95 was not only the first year the NBA shot above .350 from the three point line but the attempts were up noticeably, from 9.9 the year before to 15.3 - which was the first year attempts per game hit double digits for either league.

1466,471,James Harden and 2000 point seasons,"Even with the regular season halted early(and sadly, probably not to be continued except for the playoffs), Harden scored 2096 point in the 2019-20 season, his seventh season scoring 2000+ points, and his sixth consecutive.  Here is a list of players who have scored 2000+ in the most seasons and their longest streak they scored 2000+ consecutively.  [Source](http://bkref.com/tiny/NnaCO)  
  
Karl Malone, 12 seasons, 11 consecutive (from 1987-1998)

1467,472,The Rockets’ future is one more failed ring away from blowing up,"I should preface this post by saying that I, myself, am a Rockets fan. This post isn’t meant to attack the Rockets organization or fans. However we have worked ourselves into a corner and I need to lay it out. 

1. COACHING
There was an article that if these D’Antoni Rockets don’t win the ring this year, Mike will be likely removed from the system. This makes sense to a degree, as D’Antoni basketball functions on a style that the Rockets haven’t really been able to completely make their own, but rather simply use. With such a drastic change, D’Antoni may retire. If he doesn’t, he will be picked up by another team; he’s too good not to be.

2. TIMING
Harden has spent his rising years and prime with the Rockets, and what have they accomplished? Well this depends on what perspective you are looking at this from. As regular playoffs, they’ve done exceptionally. 2 WCF appearances and a game 7 which was one hamstring away from outing the dynasty of the greatest team ever assembled in the Golden State Warriors. But as contenders? That hamstring is the only legitimate reason they didn’t performed better that year and every year aside from that has been a sputtering of talent. Granted, they were typically faced against the powerhouse family that is GSW, but it should be noted that HOU made a strong case every time they played. Morey threw everything to make Houston get a third ring, but even the offensive phenom that is Harden is enough to take down the GSW. When the Warriors collapsed within their 72 hours of hell, the Rockets looked like finalists again: until Kawhi moved to the Clippers. This is once again a league of duos, and in a league where Lebron and AD are arguably not even the best duo in LA should give an idea of the bloodbath the West has become. Harden and Westbrook, while both phenomenal players, are going to need to be more consistent in order to keep up.

3. THROWING EVERYTHING FOR A RING
Morey has tried to do everything for a ring, including trade after trade. Houston will have its first round 1 pick in 5 years in the 2020 draft, which they will hopefully use well. But this is it. Houston has had no picks (first round) and has been running a one dimensional story for the past 5 years. And it’s not like they’re getting any younger. Houston is statistically number one in average age. They are the oldest team in the league right now. 29.8 is typically an age that fits smack middle into a player’s prime, except the Rockets are using Harden, Westbrook, and a bunch of players who are close to G League level (with some exceptions, EG, Capela, maybe Tucker). Once this team ages out, the Rockets will need to force a bunch of mediocre trades to gain a semblance of an aura of mediocrity.

WHAT CAN THEY DO?
This may not be what you want to hear and neither do I. But trades may be needed. And I’m talking about players that are beloved. I’m talking PJ Tucker, Eric Gordon, etc. Now here’s the problem with this. They won’t trade Harden because he’s a perennial MVP and I completely understand this. However Harden is a running contract that needs to be dealt with somehow, and if the Rockets want true dominating contention again, they need to circulate some better, more potential pieces around their star. The Rockets also rank third in the league in terms of salary paid, and they don’t have much leg room to get younger pieces around their star player, whoever it is whenever, without getting rid of their big pieces like the ones I’ve mentioned.

I should acknowledge why I didn’t include Capela. Personally, I’m a believer that Capela can be the future for the Rockets and that sounds stupid right now. Capela is the only young guy on this roster who is constantly showing improvement, and he is a prime example of what the Rockets are trying to do with players like McLemore, Hartenstein, Clemons, and House. I think the fact that he’s such a typical player, rising and falling more consistently rather than spiking into stardom like his fellow draftmates Embiid and Jokic makes for a reliable player. I understand that they may trade Capela but they should understand his value and not undersell him if they do this. Youth needs to be brought back into the Rockets organization. 

Also stop trading draft picks.

1468,473,Somebody a bit overlooked this season: Donovan Mitchell,"I know a lot of players are playing out of their minds this season but Spida has made some nice improvements at the start of the season.

He’s averaging 25.7/4.7/3.3 on 52/44/78 splits or on a career high .611 TS%.

From the eye test he seems to be able to find better passes in a more creative way too.

However, he’s actually shooting less 3s and more midranges this season. He’s averaging 64% on 10-16 ft shots which makes me worried about the sustainability of his efficiency through out the season.

Furthermore, although there are significant increases in assisted 2pt attempts, his assisted 3pt field goals didn’t jump up significantly. Which might mean that his current 3pm% on low volume might not be sustainable.",nbadiscussion

1470,475,The Hawks decision to trade down for Trae Young the best example of when 5D chess moves go wrong.,"Before I get into it, let me define what a 5D Chess move is. 5D Chess move is when there is an obvious and seemingly smart play is available, but you go with a less obvious but potentially higher upside move. It's a move that in the moment looks weird to other people, but you have your own 200 IQ logic of why the move is secretly genuis. If the 5D chess play works, you look like a god If it fails you look even dumber than if you just took the obvious play. 

So now lets look at the draft. The Hawks had the obvious play: take Luka at number 3. They also had the 5D chess play: Trade the number 3 pick for the number 5 pick plus another draft pick next year. 

The Hawks clearly thought that Trae Young would be just as good, if not better, than Luka. They thought their scouting department clearly had the upperhand, and other franchises just weren't as smart as them, so they couldn't see it. So if they got a player just as good as luka, plus another draft pick, then they would easily win the trade. 

The hawks have not been shy about telling everyone how smart they are. There have been plenty of articles about how they compare themselves to the early day warriors. 

Barring injury Trae Young will never be as good as Luka. I guarantee if the Hawks had the opportunity they would undo that trade 10/10 times. They tried to play 5D chess, flew too close to the sun, and look like fools. 

The Suns and Kings didn't try and play 5D chess. They didn't choose luka, but they didn't pass on Luka because they secretly thought they outsmarted the generic choice of drafting Luka. Drafting a hometown center at 1, is as classic as it gets. Drafting Bagley was just stupid to everyone involved, even the Kings. Only the Hawks thought they were secretly genuises, but ended up looking dumb. 

Sometimes playing 5D chess goes wrong kids.",nbadiscussion

***

Recently, bball-index.com put [BPM](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/bpm2.html), [PIPM](https://www.bball-index.com/player-impact-plus-minus/), [RAPTOR](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-nba-player-ratings/), and (old) RPM in a sortable table for every player. This makes it very easy to see how different impact metrics agree or disagree over certain players. 

[This chart sorts the top 30 players in the NBA by their HIGHEST rank in any of the four metrics](https://imgur.com/u14sJDH)

Immediately Westbrook jumps out. ESPN's previous version of RPM ranks Westbrook as the 8th best player in the NBA (ESPN's current version of RPM ranks him as the 10th best player). Meanwhile, he ranks 66th in BPM, 96th in PIPM, and 165th in RAPTOR. 

Not even advanced metrics can agree on whether Westbrook is good! 

Porzingis, Schroder, Whiteside, Siakam, Lopez, Rubio, and Vucevic all to some extent suffer from the same problem. 

*** 

[I also sorted the top 30 players by their LOWEST rank in any of the four metrics.](https://imgur.com/EsbAZ7P)

I think this gets a little closer to the truth of which 30 players had the most impact on their respective teams this season. 

In this chart you don't see polarizing players like Westbrook or Schroder. Instead you get guys like Danilo Gallinari and George Hill who most would agree had very strong seasons, but perhaps not otherworldly.

Of note: Zion has rankings of 26, 41, 48 and 60 in RPM, BPM, PIPM, and RAPTOR, respectively. Meanwhile Ja Morant ranks 122, 129, 124, and 193 across the same four metrics. 

*** 

[Lastly, I sorted the top 30 players by the midpoint of each player's highest and lowest ranking.](https://imgur.com/tP7QaaY)

I guess you can think of this chart as a facsimile for which 30 players that had the most impact this season that all four metrics largely agree on. 

The list of players is similar to the last chart, but with a slightly different order. 

*** 

Couple of other things that jumped out to me while putting these charts together: 

* Christian Wood had a monster season that seems to have mostly flown under the radar 
* Advanced metrics love the Bucks. They have 5 players in the top 30 in each of the three charts 
* There's a case for Zubac being the Clippers third most important player

1474,479,Predictions for 2019-20,"East

1. Milwaukee- I feel like this is too good of a team to regress. Losing Brogdon sucks, but Giannis is only going to get better, and they returned everyone else. Also, watch out for DiVincenzo as a sleeper this year. 

2. Philadelphia- Arguably the best starting 5 in the league. I believe Simmons and Embiid both take steps forward, and I love Richardson and Horford on this team.m, potentially making it the best defensive team in the league. My main concerns with this team are lack of depth and crunch time offense. Their bench is pretty good, with the best player being Mike Scott in a likelihood. Zhaire Smith could emerge and I really like Matisse Thybulle, but I wouldn’t count on anything major from them. As for crunch time scoring, last year their whole offense at the end of games was either Butler isos or Redick/Embiid two man games, so there will probably be growing pains with both Redick and Butler leaving.

3. Boston-  I am higher on Boston than most, so I can understand the argument having them lower. Starting off, I do not like Enes Kanter as the starting center, because of his lack of defensive prowess. However, I expect big jumps out of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, with a somewhat bounce back season from Gordon HaywardWhile Kemba is a downgrade from Kyrie talent wise, I believe he is a better fit for this team. If they would have kept Horford, they would have been very close to Milwaukee 

4. Brooklyn- I believe Kyrie Irving will strongly benefit from a change of scenery and will have a lot to prove this season. I like Joe Harris a lot, and Caris Levert was probably going to be an all star before he got hurt last year. I hope they start Allen over Jordan and I also believe Kurucs is really underrated. In addition to the starting lineup, they have arguably the best backup PG in Dinwiddie and also whoever isn’t starting between Jordan/Allen off of the bench

5. Indiana- They could be interchangeable with Brooklyn. This team has to just weather the storm, while Oladipo is out, and go on a run when he comes back. I had heard me might be back by Christmas, but I could be totally wrong. Losing Bogdanovic, Collison, and Thad Young hurts, but they did a decent job replacing them with Brogdon, Lamb, and Warren.

6. Toronto- This team will not be able to replace Kawhi and Danny Green. They will still be one of the best defensive teams in the league, adding RHJ and Stanley Johnson will only help that. However, they will struggle offensively, even with the leap to all star level that I am expecting out of Pascal Siakam.

7. Atlanta- This is my going out on a limb pick to make the playoffs. Last year it was Brooklyn, and I was right. Anyway, I absolutely love this young core. Trae Young and John Collins could both be borderline all stars, and Kevin Huerter is really underrated. I love the fit of DeAndre Hunter on this team, and Cam Reddish is a wild card. Losing Dedmon hurts, but I feel they will be fine without him. 

8. Miami- Replacing Josh Richardson with Jimmy Butler and getting a healthy Goran Dragic puts this team into the playoffs. I expect Bam Adebayo to make a leap this season, and Tyler Herro is one of my favorite rookies this year. 

9. Detroit- This might be the most mediocre team in the league. I have my doubts they will make the playoffs just because 2019 Blake of the Year winner, Blake Griffin had his first healthy season in a while.

10. Orlando- I do not think Vucevic is as good as he was last season. I expect Jonathan Isaac to improve but his fit next to Gordon isn’t the best. I also cannot trust a team starting D.J. Augustin at PG. 

11. Chicago- As a Bulls fan, there has been a lot of playoff buzz, but I do not see it. I expect Zach Lavine to put up similar numbers as last year, and Lauri Markkanen and Wendell Carter Jr, to make leaps. Also, for the first time in a while, I am relatively happy with our offseason moves. I believe this team is one year away, because Coby White is a year away from being a starting caliber PG, in all likelihood. 

12. Washington- If Bradley Beal gets traded this is probably the worst team in the league

13. Cleveland- Year 2 of Collin Sexton and healthy Kevin Love will be nice, but will not add very many wins. I am not sold on Darius Garland, but I really like Dylan Windler

14. New York- Nice young core, probably a year or two away from making any noise. Mitchell Robinson is a DPOY in the making and R.J. Barrett is potentially an all star in the making. Even without landing marquee free agents, there is a lot to be excited about if you are a Knicks fan.

15. Charlotte- Didn’t make the playoffs, and lost their two best players. Who is the best player on this team, Terry Rozier? 

West

1. Denver- This team is dangerously underrated right now. They were the second seed last year and started 3 guys under 25 years old. Nikola Jokic is my pick to win MVP and I expect Jamal Murray to be a borderline all star this year. I also LOVE the additon of Jerami Grant to this team. Michael Porter Jr. is the ultimate wild card.

2. L.A. Clippers- Replacing SGA and Gallinari with Kawhi and Paul George speaks for itself, and I am very high on SGA. This will be one of the best defensive teams in the league, and they have the best first two guys off of the bench in Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell.

3. Utah- First, Mike Conley replacing Ricky Rubio is a massive upgrade. Bojan Bogdanovic will give then much needed spacing on offense. Losing Derrick Favors hurts, but they added Ed Davis, who I believe is about 80% of what Favors was, which is fine off the bench. I believe Donovan Mitchell will be an all star this year, and they will have Rudy Gobert, the best defensive center in the league.

4. L.A. Lakers- Pairing Anthony Davis with LeBron speaks for itself, however this team may struggle defensively. Also, I expect Davis and LeBron to miss several games, managing their load. A starting lineup of LeBron/Danny Green/Kuzma/Davis/Cousins has disaster potential defensively. However, LeBron/AD alone gets them to a top four seed, in my eyes

5. Houston- I am a bit skeptical of Russell Westbrook’s fit on this team, but his talent paired with James Harden gets this team to the playoffs. However, I do not see this team being any better than last year.

6. Portland- Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum alone get Portland to the playoffs, and I expect Zach Collins to make a big leap. I am have a very bad feeling about Hassan Whiteside, so they have to weather the storm until Nurkic is back. Anfernee Simons will also be a good bench guy if he is unleashed.

7. Golden State- Without Klay Thompson for most of the season, Stephen Curry will have to put up MVP level numbers. D’Angelo Russell isn’t the best fit, but I believe Steve Kerr will make it work. Draymond Green will have a chip on his shoulder this season, in a contract year. I also really like the addition of Willie Cauley-Stein 

8. San Antonio- I originally had them missing the playoffs but returning Dejounte Murray and being a Gregg Popovich coached team, its hard to see them out of the playoffs. DeMar DeRozan and LaMarcus Aldridge are both all star caliber players. Lonnie Walker also looked incredible in summer league. The main issue with the Spurs is three point shooting but I believe it is somewhat offset by the fact that they will get after it defensively. 

9. New Orleans- Another team that will get after it defensively, and Zion is the clear ROY, in my opinion. A potential starting lineup of Lonzo/Jrue/Ingram/Zion/Favors would maybe mean Zion would be their worst defender in that lineup, which is scary to think about. The issue with this team is three point shooting, although J.J. Redick will help with that, and overall scoring.

10. Sacramento- I am expecting big leaps out of De’Aaron Fox and Marvin Bagley this season, but I do not think it will be enough for a playoff appearance. It isn’t so much that they got worse, it is just almost everyone in the West got better they did not get a whole lot better. 

11. Dallas- One of the biggest losers this offseason, by not surrounding Doncic and Porzingjs with a third all star caliber player. With that being said, I believe Doncic and Porzingjs are borderline all stars.

12. Oklahoma City- This obviously changes if Chris Paul gets traded, but I believe this team will be very competitive. SGA, Gallinari, and Adams are all solid players

Side Note: Whatever happened to Andre Roberson? 

13. Minnesota- They have guys who can score the ball in Karl Anthony Towns, who I believe would be an MVP candidate on a better team, and Andrew Wiggins, albeit very inefficiently. This team could also be sneaky good defensively with Covington and the addition of Jarrett Culver. However, their lack of starting PF and bench will be their downfall. 

14. Phoenix- Devin Booker and DeAndre Ayton are two building blocks, and Kelly Oubre is solid, but I do not like much else on this team. Hopefully, Monty Williams will be given more than one year.

15. Memphis- I really like this young core of Ja Morant, Jaren Jackson Jr., Brandon Clarke, and Grayson Allen, but this team is going to really struggle in the West.

1st Round
Milwaukee over Miami in 5- Giannis will be too much to handle for Miami, in addition to Middleton and Bledsoe.

Philadelphia over Atlanta in 5- This could be a similar series to Philadelphia/Brooklyn in the first round last year, with Philadelphia winning.

Boston over Toronto in 6- This would be a potentially really ugly series but Boston having more options offensively puts them in the second round. 

Brooklyn over Indiana in 7- This is a toss up, which could come down to who is better between Kyrie and Oladipo

Denver over San Antonio in 5- The experience of last season for Denver makes it a much quicker series this time around. 

L.A. Clippers over Golden State in 7- The Clippers may struggle with teams that have good defensive wings and an active big, so that is why I think this drags to seven.

Utah over Portland in 6- This would be a very good series in two raucous in environments but I think Utah is the better team here.

L.A. Lakers over Houston in 5- I think L.A. takes the first two at home and Houston somewhat throws in the towel.

Second Round

Milwaukee over Brooklyn in 5- The Nets have no one that can contain Giannis

Philadelphia over Boston in 5- I would expect Joel Embiid to have his way with Enes Kanter

L.A. Lakers over Denver in 7- This would be an absolute war, but you cannot bet against LeBron in a Game 7, against a team that has no where near the experience he does

L.A. Clippers over Utah in 7- this will be very similar to the Warriors series, for the Clippers, but I do think they prevail

Conference Finals

Milwaukee over Philadelphia in 6- The Bucks have the best player in the series and much better depth.

L.A. Clippers over L.A. Lakers in 6- I have gone back snd forth with this one, but the two way ability of the Clippers will prevail here for now. 

NBA Finals

Milwaukee over L.A. Clippers in 7- I believe Giannis will be on a mission next season, while getting his revenge on Kawhi in the process.",nbadiscussion
1475,480,What is the ceiling for this young Grizzlies core?,"Watching the Grizzlies lately has been a delight. Obviously, it looks like they have a future top 5 or 10 player in Ja, but the rest of their young core - JJJ, Clarke (68 TS%!!), and Dillon Brooks - are also exceeding expectations for their age. 

This collection of talent reminds me of the young core OKC had at the beginning of last decade. Now, that team never won a title, but they certainly could have. Does anyone else see this team contending for a title in the future? My main concern is that they’d be unable to sign a major piece in free agency, but, besides that, I think this team is going to be a juggernaut in a few years if things break right.

1476,481,Drawing Fouls from 3 is Overpowered. Here's Why and How We Can (maybe) Fix it,"Over the past decade, the NBA has been transformed by the revelation that 3 is more than 2, creating a completely different game – focussed on spacing and shooting. But the same maths that tells shooters to sit deep and avoid mid-range shots, is creating a new trend, which is equally logical and much more concerning. Drawing fouls on 3 point field goals.

Let’s fucking learn math. A 40% mid-range shot, is worth on average .8 points. A 35% 3 point shot is worth 1.05 points. A 55% inside shot is worth 1.1 points and if the player gets fouled it’s worth about 1.4 (70% free throw shooting). You get more points being fouled – so the defence is incentivised to defend cleanly. You don’t get so many that it’s worth selling contact to the detriment of your shot. The sport makes sense so far.

But what if the 3 point shooter is fouled? 3 free throws at 70% - that’s worth about 2.1 points. Double as effective as just taking the three. 

The math looks worse on a real life example. James Harden. In 2018-19 he shot the 3 at 37%. An average 3 for him is therefore worth 1.11 points. He shot 88% from the line. A 3 point foul is therefore worth 2.64 points for him. 1.11 points for shooting. 2.64 points if you’re fouled. There’s a defender nearby. What would you do?

The math is pretty clear. If you get near a defender outside 3, and you want your team to win, sell the contact and forget about the shot. 

**So how do we fix it**

What if after getting fouled on a 3 – you either got 2 free throws, or 3 free throws if you take them from the 3 point line. 

You’re still incentivised not to foul on defence – as the free throws are still worth more than the 3 point shot – but on offence you won’t get the same boost from drawing contact. You can still score 3 points if you need to by taking the three shot option. 

It would reduce the number of fouls drawn from deep with few, if any, other consequences on the game imo. I think the NBA should try it out. Let me know what you think",nbadiscussion
1477,482,LeBron is on the Clippers and Kawhi is on the Lakers. Who wins the Finals?,"Pelinka disappears. Lebron and Kawhi get switched. Assume both teams go through the same opponents they played during the bubble, and both are very receptive of the change in their main option. Are we still as sure as we were in August that the Clippers and Lakers meet in the WCF?

Lakers have to play Blazers, Rockets, Clippers, Heat

Clippers have to play Mavericks, Nuggets, Lakers, Heat

&#x200B;

I think the main problem lies in the secondary option. Paul George will no doubt have a great time playing with Lebron, but how would a team not crafted by LeGM fare as a deep team with not a ton of good-elite 3 point-specialists? How would Doc Rivers manage having Lebron on the team?

AD is going to have to revert a bit back to Pelicans' play with Rajon Rondo being the only playmaker good enough to get him the easy baskets he sees right now, and as much as I love Playoffs Rondo, I don't see him having the same success being the primary playmaker starting games.

I see the lineups being something like this:

LAKERS

1. Rajon Rondo

2. Danny Green

3. Kawhi Leonard

4. Anthony Davis

5. Dwight Howard

6. Kuzma, Markieff, McGee

&#x200B;

I find this team extremely scary on defense, but without Lebron, I can't see AD having same success he's seeing now. On the other hand, this team seems similar, at face value, like the 2019 Raptors with Rondo being a worse Lowry and AD being a better Siakam. The play at PG is weak, especially with Avery Bradley not being in the bubble.

&#x200B;

CLIPPERS

1. Lebron James

2. Landry Shamet

3. Paul George

4. Marcus Morris

5. Ivica Zubac

6. Harrell, Lou, Beverley

&#x200B;

I thought whether to start any of the three of Harrell, Lou Will, Beverley, but they could be together the strongest bench unit in the bubble. Unless Lou turn into a spot-up shooter, Lebron does not historically rely on his bench, nor has he played with his second star being another wing.

&#x200B;

As much as I would hate betting against Lebron making the finals, the Clippers are not a team that is inducive for his success. I feel the same Raptors offense is going to be played, with Kawhi's play, then Rondo-AD play. With Green-Kawhi-AD, the defense will be stifling for Lebron to play with.",nbadiscussion
1478,483,The 2019-20 Bucks have been one of the best defensive teams of the past 40 years,"#[GRAPH, IMGUR](https://i.imgur.com/MSUBUmJ.png)

When most fans think of the Bucks, what comes to mind is most likely Giannis leading an unstoppable fastbreak on an open floor spread out by shooters, with Khris serving as an excellent 2nd option, and that this has been the crux of their historic regular season, with the Bucks on pace for 70 wins before the stoppage.

However, their offense has simply been very good, not all-time great - they're 7th in the league in ORTG (112.6 offensive rating), with a relative ORTG of +2.2 (compared to league average offense). 

It's their world-beating ***defense*** that has been the main engine of their success. They rank 1st in DRTG (101.9), which is a ridiculous ***+8.5 points better than the league average defense,*** and is a whopping *+3.3 points better than the 2nd ranked Raptors*, who are having an awesome defensive season themselves, with a relative DRTG comparable to last season's top-ranked Bucks defense.

[Basketball reference link](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020.html#misc_stats::11)

- - - 

[538.com had an excellent article on the Bucks' historic defense](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/few-teams-have-ever-defended-like-these-milwaukee-bucks/), and I've quoted some relevant portions below (but the whole article is great, go give it a read!):

> By allowing just 102.0 points per 100 possessions (per Basketball-Reference), the Bucks’ defense is not only the best in the NBA right now, but also one of the best ever. That defensive rating is 8.2 points per 100 better than the average NBA defense this season — which gives Milwaukee the NBA’s best defense since the 2008 Boston Celtics, and the eighth-best unit in history.

> The Bucks have become a historically dominant defense despite largely ignoring a couple of rules that were once thought to be vitally important. 

> For starters, they play at the NBA’s fastest pace, a trait we don’t really think of when we picture a great defensive team grinding out wins in the postseason. Even more surprising: Milwaukee has managed to lock down opposing offenses despite surrendering one of the largest shares of 3-point tries of any club, something once thought to be a no-no from an analytics standpoint.


> The Bucks’ decision to play so far off the 3-point line — normally done by keeping center Brook Lopez firmly in the paint, even in pick-and-pop scenarios — is rooted in the makeup of their roster: long-limbed players and great rim protectors.

> Sometimes the Bucks all but roll out a red carpet to the rim, as they surrender more drives per 100 possessions than any other club, according to Second Spectrum. That, too, is by design: Milwaukee holds shooters to a field goal percentage of just under 60 percent from inside of 3 feet, the league’s best mark. One stat that highlights how insanely good the team has been along the back line? Of the NBA’s league’s four best stoppers at the rim, in terms of defensive field-goal differential, three — Antetokounmpo, Lopez, and Lopez’s brother, Robin — just happen to suit up for the Bucks. Opponents shoot 19 percentage points below their average at the rim when Giannis is closest to the play. They’re 17.5 points worse when Brook Lopez is nearby; 14.6 points worse when it’s Robin Lopez.

> Opposing players often see daylight ahead of them because of the seemingly advantageous angles the Bucks’ wings give them. (They even dare to give ample driving space to James Harden, albeit in an attempt to bait him into going to his off-hand side.) But the defenders, Eric Bledsoe and Donte DiVincenzo in particular, have become skilled at “rear-view contests,” sometimes erasing shots before they can leave the shooter’s hand. The Bucks’ guards have a league-high 48 rejections on jumpers and floaters.

> Even when teams do manage to get shots off against Milwaukee, there’s usually no such thing as a second chance, as the Bucks own an NBA-high defensive rebound rate of 77.1 percent.",nbadiscussion
1479,484,Orlando should trade for CP3,"To be honest, with the Vucevic signing, it makes 0 sense to be a middling team in the East that will keep getting bounced in the first round. Despite Chris Paul being on the tail-end of his career, he can push Orlando to the top 4-5 in the East and possibly help them make some noise. Magic have a decent young core and can rely on internal development for the remainder of his deal. The Magic will probably not even make the ECF, but going all in for CP3 can help revenue and grow the fanbase since Orlando will become a decent squad.

A proposed trade would be CP3 for Fournier, Augustin and possibly a guy like TRoss/Aminu/Fultz after the December 15 trade date for newly signed FAs. Thunder would probably have to throw in a pick but the CP3 trade allows them to hand the keys of the franchise to SGA and develop him to his max potential. While this will probably never happen, it's fun to imagine a trade like this going down and another star being added to a depleted East that just lost Leonard and others over the past few years.",nbadiscussion
1480,485,How much money will Fred Vanvleet realistically get this offseason,"So looking around the league there seems to be 4 main teams to be in the running for Vanvleet this offseason and those being the Knicks,Suns,Pistons and obviously the Toronto Raptors.

This year Fred Vanvleet averaged 17.6 points,6.6 assists and 3.3 rebounds on 41% from the field and 39% from three

Now these are really solid numbers but one thing that needs to be mentioned is his playoffs and how he struggled mightily with size. But asides from that Vanvleet is a very good player which a lot of teams would like to have

Now if we try to compare his stats to some other players 

Evan Fournier- Averaged 15.4 points and 2.7 assists on 46% from the field and 40% from three as a 23 year old and got a 5 year 85 million dollar contract (17 million annually)

Buddy Hield- averaged 20.7 and 2.7 assists on 46 shooting from the field and 43% shooting from three as a 26 year old and got a 5 year 94 million dollar contract

Malcolm Brogdon- averaged 15.6 points and 3.2 assists on 51% shooting from the field and 43 percent from three as a 26 year old and got a 4 year 85 million dollar contract 

Now those are the players I found that are similar to Vanvleet. However the situations of these were so much different. When Evan Fournier signed his contract it was in the summer of 2016 when the cap looked like it would grow and grow significantly every year which we know now did not happen. As for Brogdon he entered free agency in the most stacked free agency class in a long time  and a lot of teams had cap space so that could make sense why he got that contract. As for Buddy the kings were desperate and believed Buddy was going to be gone. Also we we know now a year later that contract is not looking that great is looking like a overpay for Buddy Hield.

Now looking at this free agency class then Vanvleet is the best player in it. However the next years free agency class is much better and there are a bunch of veteran guards available also like Chris Paul.

In my opinion with everything factored in I believe that Fred Vanvleet will sign a 4 year 75 million dollar contract. Or potentially even less.

1481,486,"Rockets aren't the only one playing ""small-ball""","Everyone has an opinion about the Rocket's deadline trade and how they're going all-in on ""small-ball"". Most people think it would not work against legit bigs like AD, Jokic, Gobert, Embiid, Towns, etc. I don't particularly care about the Rockets, don't have a dog in this fight. What I do care about is league-wide trends. 

With that in mind, I tuned in to the POR-UTAH game last night only to notice POR running [this](https://imgur.com/a/hqgDQVF) lineup, with Carmelo as their tallest player guarding Gobert. Now, Whiteside was hurt, and Ariza got thrown out of the game in the 2nd quarter, so the Blazers didn't really have much of a choice there, their season has been ravaged by injuries.

As [expected](https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=401161418), the Jazz bigs (Gobert/Bradley) feasted on offensive rebounds. Yet the Blazers hung around, with Carmelo/Caleb Swanigan playing the 5, and might have even won the game if it weren't for the missed goaltending call. 

My point is, it's not just the Rockets and Warriors doing this. More and more teams are trying out small-ball, most out of sheer desperation, to see if it works, and are getting comfortable with it. It may be weird and ugly, stylistically speaking, but it seems to be getting results. And it's not going away anytime soon!",nbadiscussion
1482,487,"Trae Young's Defense, while horrible, is still overblown.","I love this sub for the reason that we have really good and well thought out discussion, and I feel prompted to make this post after wallowing in the cesspool that is r/nba post game threads (my mistake, I know). All stats are from BBall Ref, or NBA.com (I couldn't find DRTG On/Off on BBall Ref so I had to resort to NBA.com).

I am not making this post to absolve him of his lack of defensive ability, but it's been a common thread in NBA circles (at least here on Reddit) that Trae's struggles on the defensive end are one of the biggest, if not the main, reason why the Hawks are unable to compete. 

To put it lightly, the Hawks as a team are allergic to defense, but no one get singled out more than Trae Young. Cam Reddish and DeAndre Hunter have been fine for rookies, but currently the only players on the team with a non-negative DBPM include:

* DeAndre Bembry (0.9)
* John Collins* (0.6)
* Evan Turner (0.1)
* Damian Jones (0.0)

Of course Collins has only played 5 games, so the only two players of that group getting meaningful minutes are Turner and Bembry. So not exactly a stacked defensive team to start with. 

To add to this, per BBall Ref, the highest ranked Hawk by DBPM is Bembry at 68th in the league. The next closest Hawk is Damian Jones at 101st and that's just the top 2 players on the team by DBPM.  “Team defense” doesn’t really exist for the Hawks yet, it’s more of a theory at this phase in Atlanta’s rebuild.

So let's move to Trae and his defense (WARNING: for those faint of heart, please look away. It's not pretty).

Currently, Trae is sitting at a DBPM of -3.2. The On/Off DRTG numbers are not kind to Trae either:

* Hawks DRTG w/ Young on: 117.3
* Hawks DRTG w/ Young off: 103.1 

This is one of the biggest arguments against Trae that pops up over and over again, but it's hardly the right way to look at his worth to the team. We all know how great he is on offense, and how much of that load he has to carry. What the stat-gazers won't see is how abysmal the offense is without Young on the court. 

* ORTG w/ Young on: 110.4
* ORTG w/ Young off: 94.3

I'm not sure there is a bigger disparity currently in the league for when a player leaves the court, and even still, watching the games, the numbers seem like they should be worse when he goes to the bench. The Hawks go from being a top 15 offensive team in the league to far and away the worst team in the league offensively. I can't count how many times I've seen him go to the bench and offensively this team just disappears. It was hard not having Huerter who is arguable the next best ball handler/facilitator on the team, but now that he's back, we still haven't seen our team with Trae sitting do much on offense. To make things worse, I'm not sure how much it will get better when Collins returns to the lineup in a few games. While he will take more attention off Trae on screen and rolls and he can shoot respectably from 3, I don't trust anyone on this team not named Trae Young to be able to get him the ball at the right place and time. 

While Trae has a loooong way to go as far as defensive ability goes, he doesn't even have the pieces around him currently to hide on that end, depending on rookies to guard wings and bigger/more explosive guards and the incredible center tandem of Alex Len, Damian Jones, and (sometimes) Bruno Fernando defending the paint. With the amount of offensive load he has to carry each night it is hard to expect him to put clamps on other guards (as much as he physically can). While he definitely hurts the Hawks on that end of the floor, it does not outweigh his contributions to the team offensively, and it shows every time he sits.

Edit: I think I didn’t clarify my point by using the On/Off stats, because a lot of people are responding that it shows how big of a liability he is defensively as well. The main point of my argument is that his contributions on offense outweigh his deficiencies on defense more than people think.

When off the court Atlanta struggles to effectively run any sort of offensive set. While the DRTG On/Off show how much worse Atlanta is with Young on the court, the lineups that get thrown out off the court is essentially a bunch of 3nD role players and screen and roll bigs that combine for little to no playmaking or shot creating ability... and Kevin Huerter when healthy. I tried highlighting this with the ORTG On/Off splits while using the DRTG On/Off as a disclaimer to let y’all know I know how abysmal Trae has been defensively and highlight the team as a whole ain’t doing so hot. That’s on me I should’ve made it clearer. I added a short paragraph up by the DBPM part that summarizes my thoughts. I hope I’m right and we’ll see it change when Collins gets back",nbadiscussion
1483,488,I still believe that Lonzo Ball can be a star some day,"I am still insanely high on Lonzo Ball. Even if he never blossoms into a true star I am positive that at worst he will be a Draymond-type elite role player on a contender.

People are way too harsh on him. He is a #2 pick only in his third season and he has missed a ton of time due to injuries. Since the day he was drafted I am convinced that his potential is sky high. A lot has changed in his game since he was drafted - his shooting fell off a cliff, and he was an elite defender right out of the gate. But my evaluation of him remained very high because the #1 reason I liked him was his elite intangibles.

Lonzo remains an elite passer and defender, but IMO his true strengths are: his unselfish desire to pass and make his teammates better, his elite court vision, and his ability to dictate pace using his energy and natural game being to push and pass the ball forward. He could be a Draymond type player on a contender: versatile and elite defender and playmaker who pushes the pace and excels in transition. 

His true strengths are his core intangibles, natural born vision, and his unselfish play style. His passing, defense, etc. are the by-product of his core strengths (court vision and hustle) rather than those things being his strengths themselves.

The problem right now is that he’s mentally figuring the NBA game out. Despite his elite court vision, the reason he struggles to create in a half court situation is because he’s not a scoring threat at all. Despite his size he struggles at driving to the rim, and his shot just disappeared his rookie season.

However, all of his problems are not hard to solve in theory. When he does decide to go to a hard drive, he’s actually good at finishing due to his size and frame, but he rarely looks for his own shot; unfortunately, his unselfish style of play hampers his team’s half court offense because defenders don’t respect his scoring ability which ends up limiting his passing ability. This is one his biggest flaws and one of the easier ones to fix. He has all the physical tools; he’s strong, big, and quick, and driving more often would create more scoring opportunities for both himself and his teammates.

His shooting is another thing that has limited him so far in his NBA career but I am confident that he’ll be a capable shooter eventually. Early on in his career, there were multiple signs (bad form, poor FT numbers) that indicated that his elite shooting in college (55/41/67 !!!) was an anomaly and that he never would truly figure it out in the NBA. This is one area where injuries have hurt him a lot - it feels like he actually is getting a feel for the game, and he gets hot for stretches. However, Lonzo unfortunately usually goes down while he is on a good shooting stretch. His FT numbers were never that good but he had stretches where he was shooting above 40% from 3 before he got injured. Initially it’s easy to dismiss this as just another hot streak but he’s consistently gone on streaks where he’s played and shot well, until he gets injured and he’s cold immediately after returning. To me it’s clearly a mental issue, and once he gets healthy he’ll go back to being a good shooter.

Now, let’s talk about his situation on the Pelicans. Although the popular opinion is that Gentry should be fired for underperforming this year, I think the Pelicans should stay patient and continue developing their young talent and see how they look after a healthy Zion comes back. I actually really liked the Pelicans roster construction this year outside of a glaring lack of shooting. It was very similar to the formula they used 2 seasons ago where they swept the Blazers:

-	Have 2 elite defensive guards who can make plays, force turnovers, and push the pace in transition (Rondo/Jrue -> Lonzo/Jrue)
-	Dominant big (AD -> Zion)
-	Defense oriented squad that thrives in transition

The one thing that team lacked was an elite wing, someone who could score in a half court setting and take the pressure off their superstar big. Those Pelicans teams were notorious for basically having no capable wings. In Brandon Ingram they have an MIP candidate and blossoming star who perfectly fits the rest of this team. 

Despite the Pelicans struggles, I maintain that they should stay with the currently constructed roster. They’re not losing because of their roster they’re losing because their good players are injured and their team is still young and needs time to gel. 

If they keep Jrue he’ll be fantastic for mentoring Lonzo. JJ has also popped up a lot in trade discussions but keeping him could do wonders for Lonzo’s shooting and hopefully improve his form. Gentry looks terrible so far this season but he was the one who designed that aforementioned game plan vs the Blazers that Lonzo fits so well in, I’d stay patient and give him at least until the end of this lost season to see if Lonzo develops any better under him. 

**TL;DR: Lonzo has some glaring flaws in his game currently, but they are all easily fixable and he has the physical tools, work ethic, and mentality to improve in all of those areas. The only thing that would hinder his development is if his injury woes continue to bother him throughout his career.  The Pelicans shouldn’t panic right now and should stay patient with their young roster.**",nbadiscussion

1486,491,The Warriors' SF problem.,"First of all, I think the Warriors are still contenders and a lock for the playoffs barring injury to Curry or Green but I do see a pretty big problem with their team this season.

This off-season saw the end of  the warriors'  great small forward combo, both KD and Iguodala left and now they have very few options at that postion. Right now their options to start at the 3 are Alfonzo McKinnie, Glen Robinson and maybe Alec Burkes. McKinnie would be a fine option if they had him as filler with a player that can handle big minutes from the bench, but in their current state he could have to play more minutes than what you want him to play. I liked Robinson from the little I saw of him in Detroit last season he was a good defender altough terrible in the offense, that shouldnpt be as bad in the GSW system. That said, he isn't the guy you want guarding the west's superstar forwards (LBJ, PG, Kawhi) so then draymond takes that responsibility and you have a PF or C feasting on the smaller Robinson. Finnaly Burks, he shouldn't play at the forward at all imo, last year with the cavs he had to fill that role since our only other 3 was Cedi and it looked bad (even by 2018-2019 Cavs standard) he was way more effective and confortable playing the 2.

So, you just move Draymond or Klay to the 3 right? The problem there is that [Draymond is not good at that position, which he has said himself](https://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/253605/Draymond-Green-Playing-Small-Forward-As-A-Rooke-Almost-Had-Me-Out-Of-NBA). On the other hand, you have Klay who actually played a lot of 3 in 2016 and it makes a lot of sense to have D'lo at the 2 and Klay at the 3. In fact, that may as well be the obvious answer to this question, but Klay isn't going to be there for most of the season and come playoff time I don't think you want your player coming off an ACL injury to be the primary defender on LeBron, one of Kawhi and PG13 or Harden, specially when he will have a considerable offensive responsibility.

This all leads to the actual reason I made this post.  Should the warriors have kept Iguodala? His contract is pretty terrible and I understand why they dumped him but whenever I see their lineup for this season I can't help but think they have a massive gap that he could have filled and that the players they got with their extra space aren't going to make much of difference in tackling this problem. What do you think?",nbadiscussion
1487,492,When was Kobe the best player in the world?,"Having an argument with my friends who seem to think Kobe was never the best in the world.

I know at some point in time he was considered to be the best in the world, but when exactly? 

I want to say it was between 2006 and 2009 with LeBron making a good case around the time of his 2nd MVP campaign?

I only ask this because I can't seem to remember and a lot of the media/internet says LeBron has been the best since '07 due to his playoffs run. 

But from what I know, Kobe's accolades, championships, and scoring records always kept LeBron at bay until 2010.",nbadiscussion
1488,493,How long of an acclimation period would it take a star outside shooter from the 50's (like Dolph Schayes) if he was transported to now to become a good player in today's league?,"I've studied the old-school NBA quite a bit & have seen everything that's easily accessible from the early eras, and there are about 10 players who entered the league before 1960 who could be transported to today and acclimate fairly quickly to the modern game and still be really good: **Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Maurice Stokes, Bob Pettit, Sam Jones, Elgin Baylor, Guy Rodgers, Hal Greer, and Bob Cousy** (*West & Oscar entered the league in '60*). Beyond them, the next most likely are a few more guys with obvious skills or traits that *probably* would allow them to acclimate, but I'm less certain: **Tom Gola, Bill Sharman, Tommy Heinsohn**, and possibly **Paul Arizin**.

Then there's the curious case of **Dolph Schayes**. He was a mega-star in the 50's (*it was basically him, Mikan, Pettit, and Cousy at the top of the food chain before Russell*), and at 6-ft-8, 220 pounds he had the size to not get overwhelmed physically as a modern forward. He wasn't exactly fast/athletic, but not every forward today is. He was known for 2 key things: 1) his can't-stop-won't-stop relentlessness in all that he did (*most notably practicing & rebounding - was a great rebounder*), and 2) his outside shot. As a big man who shot from distance regularly & accurately, he's been compared to Larry Bird by historians who are kind to the early game. The problem is that when you watch [his highlights](https://youtu.be/EL2s7i86rog), you can see that he doesn't have a clean jumper by today's standards (*West and Pettit were fine on this front*). He would hit outside shots, often from well beyond 3-point range, at a good rate for the time, but if he showed up today he would have to take time to fix his shot. Even with a so-so FG%, there's no doubt he could shoot (*keeping in mind FG%'s were low due to clogged lanes and he took lots of long shots which automatically made it worse compared to other big men*): he was a REMARKABLE free throw shooter, leading the league in FT% 3x, and finishing top-3 in the league for 10 straight seasons. It's clear he spent time working on his shooting and excelled at it (*seriously, his gym rat stories are legendary*), but the mechanics of that 50's jumper wouldn't work today. To be clear, his case is quite different than someone like **Richie Guerin**. Guerin was a 6x All-Star, HOF guard with the Knicks in the 50's/60's who had all the size, athleticism, aggression, dribble-driving, defense, and decision-making to be a great guard today ... but he straight-up had a [set shot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kqNcXB_cbk&t=2m42s), and that's too much for me to get past. That video has a couple highlights from later in his career where his shot looks more modern, so maybe there's hope for the Dolph Schayes of the world if we can put together a Time Machine NBA Hall of Famers league someday.

What are your thoughts on how long it would take someone like Schayes, who was a great outside shooter in the 50's, to acclimate to today considering it's the very structure of his shot that would need to change? Or do you think his shot and today's shot are so different, that it's uncertain if he ever could acclimate?",nbadiscussion

1490,495,Draymond Green's draft profile as a defender,"Draymond Green being a Defensive Player of the Year and one of the best defenders of his era, it's kind of incredible to think that coming into the NBA, one of the question marks about him was whether he could defend at this level, part of the reason why he fell to 35.

From DraftExpress:

""Defensively, Green has some very good things going for him mainly his terrific timing and soft hands, things that allow him to contribute significantly in terms of making plays on the court and getting his team extra possessions. He's an excellent rebounder (12.3 per-40p), particularly on the defensive end, and gets quite a few blocks (1.5 per-40p) and steals (1.9 per-40p) thanks to his ability to anticipate with his terrific feel for the game.

.

**Unfortunately, Green's physical limitations make it quite difficult to project him as being anything more than a liability on this end of the floor in the NBA. His lack of size means he's quite easy to post up and just shoot over the top of even at the NCAA level, and his poor lateral quickness makes it tough to envision him being able to guard most power forwards on the perimeter or even less likely small forwards, which his height suggests he'd have to. This will be a major hurdle for Green to overcome, and it's not quite clear whether a NBA team will be able to get past this issue, despite what he contributes in various other facets of the game.""**

Source: http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Draymond-Green-5859/

.

This is his coach Tom Izzo though before the draft:

“He may be the best player in college basketball because of what he does. I mean, I know Kentucky, I know Kansas; I know the players they’ve got. But if you talk about a guy that does more things, and we don't even get to the leadership stuff because coaches can't, media people voting around the country can't understand that, can't see that, they're not in the places where that happens.

.

**“When you talk about defense, I'd be the first to tell you, he's not our best defender, but he might be by far our best cerebral defender, understanding the things, reminding guys who is going where, knowing all five positions. I think I've had some pretty good guys at that. I don't think I've ever had a guy like him. “So when you talk about a valuable guy, this kid has done it all.”**

.

All things considered, Green falling to 35 probably worked out best for him. But the point I'd like to discuss is that Draymond was statistically an excellent college player with high intangibles who dropped to the 2nd round mainly due not fitting the prototypical body type of a PF or SF. My question is, are there any players similar to Green in the upcoming or recent drafts and has there been a shift in how they are viewed with the current focus on versatile players?",nbadiscussion

And let’s combine both together so you can’t just choose one or the other but overall of both categories.

If you had to choose, would it be...

The scoring champ? 13 second man? Mr 1:st round exit. 

Or 

Half man half amazing, dunk champion, worlds greatest dunk of all time and college matters. 

Just some random thoughts, I’m really having a hard one over who to choose. 

Like Vince took dunking to a whole nother level. He was iconic in beginning of his career and ebbed out towards the middle/end (Jersey years-ish) whereas T-Mac evolved more at his two stops and became Tracy Mccgrady the scoring champ in Orlando and evolved into T-Mac the scoring machine in Houston.

However, in its current iteration, it is clear that the judging for the Dunk contest attracts a lot of complaint on social media and r/nba. 

Is this just symptomatic of the five-judge panel and 1-10 scoring system? Or is this a result of the arbitrary scoring criteria? Maybe you think it's both, or perhaps you believe that the dunk contest is just a fun showing that shouldn't be put under such scrutiny? In either case, I'd like to hear your thoughts. 

If you think it should be revamped, how? Why? What criteria do you think should taken into account? (e.g. Should failed attempts be factored into the score?

1493,498,"If you were the Warriors, would you be comfortable with Klay Thompson playing the 3 for extended periods?","This seems like it's the biggest question when it comes to the Warriors' planning for their future, and what to do with potential assets (Iguodala trade exception, potential high pick, even possibly trading DLo). If you feel comfortable with Klay at the 3, especially on the defensive end, then keeping DLo and having him play the 2-guard position makes a lot of sense. On the other hand, if you really want to keep Klay at the 2-guard spot, you need to use some of those assets to pick up a starting-caliber 3, ideally one who fits well with the other pieces on the team, which is why you see so many trade machine things with the Warriors trying to get a guy like Robert Covington. To my mind, this whole thing really comes down to three questions that any team with championship ambition needs to answer: 

1. Who guards the ball-dominant scoring guards, such as Harden, Lillard, Kemba, etc. For the Warriors in the past, that's usually been Klay. 

2. Who guards the mismatch-nightmare wings like LeBron, PG, Kawhi, KD, Jimmy Butler, etc. I think a lot of these guys are simply too big and strong for a guy like Klay, even though he is a good defender with decent size. Obviously, GSW's other decent option there is to have Draymond play man defense, but that isn't the optimal use of his skills, which are far better-leveraged by letting him roam and be a help defender.

3. Who guards the dominant big men, like AD, Jokic, Embiid, etc. For the Warriors in the playoffs, this would ideally be a combination of Draymond and Kevon Looney.",nbadiscussion
1494,499,Best assist-adjusted 3pt shooters of the 2000s,"# Intro

In 2019 James Harden made history by sinking 317 unassisted triples. However, his 3pt% for the season was 'only' 36.8 - good, but not the mark we would expect for one of the league's premier shooters.

This is because unassisted shots are, in general, more difficult than assisted ones.

From 2013, when the NBA started video tracking, players have made approximately 37% of catch-and-shoot 3pters, 3pters without dribbling, or 3pt shots within two seconds of touching the ball. These three overlapping categories make up the vast majority (over 90%) of assisted 3pters. All other 3pters were hit at \~30%.

# Method

This data is useful because, thanks to play-by-play data from basketball-reference, we know how many assisted/unassisted threes players made back to 2001. If we assume that they shot about 7% better when assisted, we can then estimate shot difficulty.

From here we can calculate 'shots made above average' - a concept similar to [Kirk Goldsberry's ShotScore](http://grantland.com/features/kirk-goldsberry-introduces-new-way-understand-nba-best-scorers/), which [I've explored earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/au81d0/kirk_goldsberrys_shotscore_20022013/). The idea is to see how many threes a player would have made compared to a league-average shooter taking the same number of assisted/unassisted shots.

Finally, I've added 'pure shooting percentage': an estimate of how they would shoot if they attempted unassisted 3s at a league-average rate.

# Discussion

* Not going to lie, I kinda expected Harden to top this year, but Curry's percentage gap was too much to overcome.
* Curry leads every season since he was drafted except 2012, where he played 25 games and finished 13th. He even managed to win last year in 50 games.
* Nash looks really good, as does Billups.
* Ray Allen was expected, as well as one good year for Redd.
* Kobe doesn't look great (bearing in mind that it's not a perfect measure of shot quality)
* LeBron hovers around average except his last couple of years in Miami

1496,501,Who had the better offensive regular season? 2000-2001 Allen Iverson or 2016-2017 Isaiah Thomas?,"I also posted in /r/nba.

First off, I’m not arguing who was the better player. AI deservedly won MVP in 2001 for leading the Sixers to the best record in the East, while also leading the league in both points and scoring. Unlike IT, Iverson is also not a complete defensive liability and has had a decade of dominance in the NBA (although IT did get 5th place in MVP voting in 2017 while being the worst defender in the league). I’m not asking who is the better offensive player in the playoffs. Iverson led the Sixers to the finals in 2001 on 30+ ppg, taking a game from the seemingly unstoppable Lakers while IT played through his hip injury to bring the Celtics to the ECF.

My question is who had the better offensive regular season. Contrary to popular opinion, I personally believe that Isaiah Thomas had a better offensive season, but I’ll post some stats to spur up some discussion.



|     **Player**     | **Allen Iverson** | **Isaiah Thomas** |
| :----------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: |
|  Points per Game   |     **31.1**      |       28.9        |
| Rebounds per Game  |      **3.8**      |        2.7        |
|  Assists per Game  |        4.6        |      **5.9**      |
|  Steals per Game   |      **2.5**      |        0.9        |
|  Blocks per Game   |      **0.3**      |        0.2        |
| Turnovers per Game |        3.3        |      **2.8**      |
|        FG%         |      42.0 %       |    **46.3 %**     |
|        3PT%        |      32.0 %       |     **37.9%**     |
|        FT%         |      81.4 %       |    **90.9 %**     |
|        TS%         |      51.8 %       |    **62.5 %**     |
|   Points per 100   |       39.3        |     **42.4**      |
| Points per 36 Min  |       26.7        |     **30.8**      |



Comparing both players’ per game stat lines, Iverson edges Thomas in points, rebounds, steals and blocks per game. However, because AI played so many minutes, IT actually scored more points per 36 minutes. The pace argument for Iverson doesn’t work here because IT scored more points per possession as well. While AI led the league in points per game in 2001, Isaiah Thomas was 3rd in points per game after the rivalry of MVP Westbrook and Point Harden. In fact, IT4 was second only to Westbrook in points per possession.

What’s even more impressive for Isaiah Thomas is that he scored so highly on 62.5% TS. In fact, the [only other guard to have a 28 ppg season on over 60% TS](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&match=single&type=per_game&per_minute_base=36&per_poss_base=100&season_start=1&season_end=-1&lg_id=NBA&age_min=0&age_max=99&is_playoffs=N&height_min=0&height_max=99&birth_country_is=Y&as_comp=gt&as_val=0&pos_is_g=Y&c1stat=ts_pct&c1comp=gt&c1val=0.62&c2stat=pts_per_g&c2comp=gt&c2val=28&order_by=ws) (cherry picked I know) is unanimous MVP Stephen Curry in 2016. Iverson’s lower efficiency could be argued because of different pace and defense rules back then, but even compared to league average, IT’s efficiency is insane. For reference, average TS in 2001 was 51.7% and in 2017 was 55.3%.

During the 2001 season, Iverson was known to be one of the clutchest and smoothest offensive players in the league. His iso-heavy playstyle was borderline unstoppable, as he all but perfected the crossover. Iverson led the league in 4th quarter scoring with 7.5 points per game.  Similarly, 5 foot 9 IT4 was known as the King of the Fourth Quarter, scoring 9.8 ppg in the 4th quarter (second only to Russell Westbrook). Both players led their teams to the first seed in the Eastern conference.

Here are some advanced stats for both players for more information in this discussion. More holistic advanced stats were not available for the 2001 season.

| Player | Allen Iverson | Isaiah Thomas |
| :----: | :-----------: | :-----------: |
|  PER   |     24.0      |   **26.5**    |
|  OWS   |      7.3      |   **10.9**    |
|   WS   |     11.8      |   **12.5**    |
|  OBPM  |      5.0      |    **7.8**    |
|  BPM   |      6.1      |    **6.7**    |
|  VORP  |    **6.1**    |      5.6      |
|  ORtg  |      106      |    **122**    |

I personally think that Isaiah Thomas had a better offensive regular season in 2017 than Iverson in 2001. It is important to also note that the eye test is important for evaluating offensive talent in addition to just stats. Of course, AI is the better player based on longevity and defense alone, but I would like to hear your thoughts.",nbadiscussion
1497,502,For which team MJ would be a great fit when he signed for Wizards?,"MJ decided to come back for a 2nd time, at the start of 2001-02 season. Obviously he signed with Wizards, but he regret it later. From Wiki: ""On May 7, 2003, Wizards owner Abe Pollin fired Jordan as the team's president of basketball operations. Jordan later stated that he felt betrayed, and that if he had known he would be fired upon retiring he never would have come back to play for the Wizards""

Especially as MJ was willing to play for salary of 1 mil, he could actually choose where he could go easily. So, what do you think where he would fit best? Which roster & coach would be able to get the best of him and make him happy on the same side, in order to win a title?

So without trading anyone from the roster, just to add MJ. I had a quick look and Spurs, with Robinson & Timmy, young Parker, Bowen led by Pop seems like a perfect fit. Question is how MJ would fit in Pop's philosophy. 

What would be cool is Minny; KG & Billups, decent team, made playoffs.

What would be like coming home; Charlotte. Young Baron Davies, Mashburn & Wesley to help scoring, PJ Brown under the rim. Cool.

Sonics - GP still putting top numbers. They would make most vicious front court ever. Rashard Lewis & Vin Baker there to help.

Blazers - his old mate Scottie was there. Prime Sheed & Damon, Bonzi Wells. This would be also cool story.

1499,504,Do you think Orlando quietly had one of the worst off-seasons in the NBA?,"They had a goal of adding on to a playoff caliber roster that made the playoffs a year ago while also developing their young players: Isaac, Bamba and Fultz. 

They re-signed Terrance Ross and Nikola Vucevic while adding Al-Farouq Aminu on a 3 year 29 million deal and drafting Chuma Okeke.

Personally I think the Aminu contract was great value for a good wing but I don’t believe he was a great fit for them because he plays the same position as Gordon and Isaac and he doesn’t shoot the 3 ball well enough to play the 3 on a team that already has a below average 3 point shooter at the 2(Fournier 34%), and 4(Gordon 35%). For Vucevic who is their best player and a back to the basketball bigman who works primarily in the post.

Secondly they didn’t really give their young players a path to playing time. Bamba was drafted a year ago and will most likely have to sit behind Vucevic for another 4 years and Isaac has more competition at the PF position. 

I think splitting Gordon and Isaac would have been a smart decision.",nbadiscussion
1500,505,"[OC] the potential ""Kendrick Perkins Overplayed Oldie"" team","Sometime in 2029, we're all going to be watching the *30 for 30* on the failures of the Oklahoma City ""dynasty"" and wonder what could have been if Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden all got to play their careers together. Unfortunately, that group peaked with their loss to Miami and never returned to the Finals again.

That doc will be so jam packed of ""could have beens"" and ""should have beens"" that it may not have time to mention one of the most important of all. What if Scottie Brooks didn't play Kendrick Perkins so damn much?

If you don't remember, Brooks stuck with the veteran Perkins in the starting lineup, well past the point of stubbornness. The stats suggested they were better without them, but Brooks continually trotted him out there, content to punt the first 6 minutes of every game.

And in a way, it's hard to blame Brooks for that. At the time, Kendrick Perkins was a hard player to bench. He'd won a title in Boston, and garnered a huge amount of respect in the OKC locker room. Shelving him may have led to a rebellion. But unfortunately, *playing* him may have directly led to a loss as well.

I'll always remember that decision because it comes up time and time again. The respected veteran who gets overplayed by a coach. The ""Kendrick Perkins Overplayed Oldie."" Going forward, I have earmarked three players with the potential to fill that unfortunate role for their teams this season.

**PG Rajon Rondo, Los Angeles Lakers**

The new-look Los Angeles Lakers were going to have a hard time settling on the right lineup even before DeMarcus Cousins went down with injury. The guard spot will be especially tricky to figure out. Reportedly, LeBron James wants to call himself a ""point guard"" now, but he's not actually going to be guarding any point guards. Someone will need to play that position, no matter what they may call it.

My fear, from the Lakers' perspective, is that if they default to the veteran Rajon Rondo. Rondo elicits tons of respect from his fellow players, but that tends to be the *problem*. His reputation dwarfs his actual production. The raw stats may still be solid (8.0 assists in 29.8 minutes last year), but they're not always winning plays. And while he shot well from three last season (35.9%), his true shooting still lagged down at 47% due to poor shooting elsewhere. Defensively, he's relied on his reputation for years now, grading as a -1.4 on ESPN RPM. Overall, it's hard to see Rondo as anything more than a net negative starter these days (at age 33.) 

There appeared to be a path forward for Rondo to be a solid rotation player for the Lakers off the bench, particularly if they played him alongside his old buddy DeMarcus Cousins.  But with Boogie down? Rondo's offensive limitations would become more pronounced in that role as well. He'd be best with bigs (like Cousins, or Anthony Davis) that can space the court, but the Lakers will have plenty of cloggers in the middle now.

The trouble is: the Lakers aren't exactly brimming with other options on the perimeter. They have shooting guards like Danny Green, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope who can perhaps play de facto ""point guard,"" and more limited point guards like Quinn Cook (limited on defense) and Alex Caruso (limited track record.)

The most interesting candidate -- and the one the Lakers should hope to emerge as a reliable option -- is veteran Avery Bradley. Like Rondo, Bradley has been overhyped based on his Boston days for quite a while now. Frankly, he's been one of the worst NBA starters lately. In some ways, he's the anti-Rondo. He can shoot threes (36% career), but can't do much else. Last season, he averaged a modest 2.8 rebounds and 2.4 assists over the course of 30.2 minutes a night.

If you're looking for a positive here, it's that Bradley should be a lot better in a limited role here in L.A. Essentially, he could be a 3+D guard who only launches open threes, and hounds opposing point guards on defense. In reality, his defense has sagged lately as well (also grading as a negative on ESPN RPM.) However, perhaps some of that comes from playing ""up"" in size as a wing when he really should be at PG full-time defensively.

The Lakers should go into this season *hoping* that these veterans can give them good minutes. Avery Bradley could (in theory) fit in as a 3+D guard alongside ball-dominant LeBron James, and Rajon Rondo could (in theory) anchor the bench as a playmaker. But coach Frank Vogel needs to be careful here. These players have not been consistently good lately, so they can't be grandfathered into 25-30 minutes a night based on reputation alone. If they aren't clicking, and Vogel stubbornly refuses to adjust accordingly, we may have some ""Perk"" potential here.

**PF Jeff Green, Utah Jazz**

A three-year veteran in college and a survivor of heart surgery, Jeff Green has always been one of the most respected players in the NBA. He's a good guy, and he's willing to fit it to whatever role the team wants from him.

Unfortunately, his reputation may have always surpassed his actual value (dating back to the days when he was seen as a core piece for Oklahoma City.) He's about ""average"" in every category, and can drift down into the ""below average"" camp when the wind shifts.

Last season with Washington was actually one of Jeff Green's best seasons. He averaged 12.3 points in 27.2 minutes, pumping in a strong 60.8% true shooting. Still, you wonder if that may be a little bit of fool's gold. For his career, he's only a 33.3% shooter from beyond the arc, and only registers a 53.7% true shooting. And while he may look the part on defense, he's graded as a negative there lately as well (-1.21 ESPN RPM.) At 33, his legs do not move as well as they used to.

It's too early to tell exactly what role Quin Snyder and the Jazz have in store for Green. Their summer was all about adding offensive weapons like Mike Conley and Bojan Bogdanovic. Still, there's a real chance that Snyder defaults to Green as the ""starter,"" and plays him 20-25 minutes a night because he projects as a more natural PF than Bogdanovic at this stage in his career.

Given his modest contract (vet minimum), Jeff Green was a solid signing for Utah. He's the type of player who can fill in minutes at SF and PF and not hurt you badly. However, Snyder needs to be careful not to over-rely on Green, particularly if his shot isn't falling.

**PG Derrick Rose, Detroit Pistons**

Coming into last year, I grumbled about the Minnesota Timberwolves bringing Derrick Rose back. Clearly, they needed to let him go and hand the reins at backup PG to Tyus Jones. Clearly, Derrick Rose's hot three-point shooting from the playoff before would not last more than a few weeks.

In that way, Rose proved me wrong. He played well (offensively) all season long for Detroit. We always knew he could score (18.0 PPG in 27.3 minutes), but he continued to shoot well, nailing 37% of his threes. You could make the argument that he was a true Sixth Man of the Year contender, and at minimum, that he was at least a good backup PG.

So what's the problem here? The concern is if Dwane Casey and the Detroit Pistons treat him as *more* than that. Even now, Rose has more name value than current starter Reggie Jackson. There may be a clamor for Rose to take a heavy share of those PG minutes, or even to play alongside Jackson with a two PG lineup.

In my opinion, there's a danger of over-extending Rose here. While he can still light it up, he's a defensive liability these days (at age 30). In fact, he graded as an atrocious -2.53 in ESPN RPM. You can make the case that his offense kinda-sorta makes up for that as a bench playmaker, but in the starting lineup (or with starters-level minutes), that becomes problematic.

Moreover, I'm worried that Casey may play Rose more minutes at the expense of some younger players on the roster: namely SG Luke Kennard. Casey never fully warmed up to Kennard, but he has the true offensive skill that makes up for any defensive liability. To take the next step out East, the Pistons need Kennard to be good. Playing Rose big minutes would be a Band-aid, not a long-term fix. In fact, if Casey overplays Rose (and his shooting cools off) he may be a net negative for them and make their playoff berth more dicey than expected.",nbadiscussion
1501,506,Final predictions on where Kawhi lands in free agency?,"Cris Carter, the FS1 analyst who shares an agent with Kawhi, says a decision is coming tomorrow on where he plays next. We know it comes down to the Raptors, Lakers, and Clippers, but with the small amount of leaks and the conflicting information running abuzz, we really don’t know where his mindset is. So let’s look and evaluate his options:


Staying with Toronto- pays him the most if it’s a long-term deal. Already won a championship there and have a good core in place. One of the most stable front offices in the league. A fan base that adores him. A whole country behind him. A good brand move if he wants to continue on as the guy there. Also opens up parity in the league. 

Signing with the Lakers- creates a top-heavy superteam. Kawhi’s hometown. An instant championship favorite if he signs there. Probably the least popular move of the three based on parity. Argument on if it would be Kawhi’s team or not. Gives him Anthony Davis to play with as LeBron ages out in later years. Great winning situation. 

Signing with the Clippers- If Kawhi wants his cake and wants to eat it too. Clippers allows him to be the leader of the team while also playing at home. Great individual brand move. Can battle LeBron for LA. Good supporting cast similar to the Raptors, but probably not the championship favorite. Great proven coach and front office. 


Can’t really get a good read on Kawhi’s thinking, but a decision is probably coming soon. I thought this would be the best sub for basketball discussion so what do you all think Kawhi ends up doing?",nbadiscussion

However the big question is does Bam do this and wait till next year or just get the guaranteed money right now? Look at Johnathon Isaac he was about to get a nice contract but after his injury he won’t be getting anywhere near the same amount he was getting before. Bam could secure a big contract right now or have a major risk on his potential money. He would be eligible for 25% of the cap in a extension right now which makes it harder to get a big name. So what does Bam Adebayo do? He’s a mommy’s boy and cares and loves deeply about his family so that’s something you have to consider as well.

1504,509,"Jalen Brunson, Mavs' 2nd round pick this season, showed he has the talent of a 1st rounder.","Jalen Brunson came into the draft after spending 3 years in college, with 2 championships and winning the National College Player of the Year Award in his last season. He, then, was selected with the 33rd pick in the draft by the Dallas Mavericks, being overshadowed by the rookie sensation Luka Doncic at the time.


**First games of the season**


Jalen did not play the Summer League in 2018. In his first 8 games as a pro, he was getting consistent minutes off the bench, with an average of around 17 per game, and also starting in a game Dennis Smith didn't play because of an injury. Jalen had a really small role with the team, and played a lot of times without the ball, since the roster already had 3 primary playmakers that had a higher priority than him. So, all we used to see from him were some smart cuts and some nice passes, but nothing really special. And since he was being used more as an off-ball shooter and was struggling to hit shots, he took a less important role as the veteran Devin Harris started to get minutes.


**Jalen starts to get more playing time**


But, DSJ would get injured in early december. And, since Carlisle needed another guard, Brunson not only started to get more consistent minutes again, he became the Mavs' starter for 8 consecutive games. Now, with a much bigger role, Brunson showed he had talent. In this games, he had averaged of 11 points per game, and we were seeing he was indeed really smart, showing he could play in the team's system really well, making good decisions with and without the ball. And, with good handles and ability to score, he was having a really good stretch.

And since DSJ and Barea struggled with injuries, Brunson was getting some minutes consistently, and was a starter in multiple games. But, with multiple scorers and veterans on the roster, Jalen didn't necessarily have a big role and a lot of touches. 


**4 starters get traded**


But then, as you may remember, the Mavs traded Barnes, Matthews, DAJ and Smith for Porzingis that was injured and other guys that didn't have the ball a lot like the previous starters. Now, we had the opportunity to see how Brunson could perform with the ball on his hands and freedom to do whatever he wanted to. 

And he showed up. He is a really smart ball-handler and penetrator, knowing when to make the pass and having a good arsenal of moves to get open. He also started to shoot much better from the perimeter, making him a bigger threat on the offensive side of the court. Since the All-Star break, Brunson started in 22 of 24 games, and had averages of 14 points, 5 assists and 3 rebounds, with shooting splits of 51/35/78. 

Brunson finished the season with the second highest point-totals of a Mavs 2nd round rookie in franchise history, with 678 points in the season. As a starter, the rookie had averages of 13 points, 4 assists and 3 rebounds per game.


**Conclusion**

Brunson is a good player with and without the ball, and has the ability to lead a bench unit or play a secondary-role to Mavs' stars Luka Doncic and Kristaps Porzings, due to his intelligence and understanding of the game and the team's system. Carlisle has always had a good relationship with playmakers that can shoot, and with Brunson won't be different. He likely was a top-14 rookie this season in this class, and is one of the biggest steals of the draft.",nbadiscussion
1505,510,Is there any player who can actually guard 1-5?,"As for as I know, the only one that comes to mind is Dennis Rodman. But I've heard a ton of people say this 'guard 1-5' thing as an argument for their favorite player being better than another player.

I've heard people say this about AD, Draymond, Giannis, etc. And as someone who's watched all heavily, most of them cannot effectively guard and shutdown any of the 5 positions.

The only other player that comes to mind is LeBron from 2011-2013 where he guarded and shutdown MVP Rose in 2011, shutdown Monta Ellis in 2013, etc. But even then, he only did that for 2 seasons. 

Also, they don't have to be a superstar player, I'm just curious as to who, outside of Rodman, could've actually did this on a consistent basis for a long period of time.

1506,511,Where Does 'MoreyBall' Breakdown?,"Hey everyone, first time visiting this page, and I'm extremely impressed with the quality of NBA discussion here! I'm a bit new to basketball analytics, and I wanted to ask where people think the 'MoreyBall' analytics plan starts to breakdown.

&#x200B;

As someone new to basketball analytics, I've only watched the Rockets the last two postseasons. In that period of time, Morey has explained losses through:

&#x200B;

1. Missing 27 straight threes - at least a 5+ sigma event (layman's terms, a very very very unlikely event)
2. If you look at the implied math on the Rockets' foul analysis from the 2018 WCF, they are implying another 5 sigma event for missed calls / referee impact
3. Math on the Rockets' efficiency metrics in the playoffs vs. regular season seem to imply at least a \~3 sigma level of underperformance compared to other playoff data sets. Playing an all-time great team in the Warriors probably makes this data point less important as there's a hard to quantify impact from playing an extremely tough team

&#x200B;

Daryl seems like a relatively smart person, so I'm sure he would agree that any time you receive model outputs saying repeated 5 sigma events are the reason you're losing, you immediately need to revisit your model because it is highly highly highly likely the model is significantly flawed. I'd love to start a discussion on where we think the 'Moreyball' model starts to breakdown. Most of the assumptions widely discussed (hunt fouls because they're insane efficiency, 3 > 2, fouls on 3s and corner 3s by far most important, shots near the rim, etc.) are individually all correct. The immediate potential model flaws that come to mind for me that I'll eventually post analyses for:

&#x200B;

1. Playoff basketball fouls are not reffed the same way as in the regular season
2. Morey is asking D'Antoni to have the team play a slower pace vs. the Warriors. I think he believes the Rockets are not as talented, so reducing the number of possessions should jack up variance in the games, which the Rockets need to win. The Rockets do not practice this in the regular season and therefore are less efficient
3. This will be hard to analyze, but playoff basketball seems to be all about winning 50-50 positions and stepping up in the 3 - 5 plays you are able to as a role player. The reliance on isolation basketball may not foster an environment where role players are ready to step up. I say this primarily because qualitatively, it seems to me that some of the more successful coaches like Pop, Kerr, Phil Jackson have all preached making sure the entire team is involved

&#x200B;

Looking forward to hearing your points!

T'Wolves get a first pick to go with D'Lo and KAT. I think unless the Wolves go hard BPA, they're probably looking for a good shooter and solid defense at any non-C position. In theory, the Warriors hope to get someone NBA ready (Obi Toppin? James Wiseman?) so they can make another run at a championship with everyone finally healthy again. The Hornets need to find a star player, so they would likely target high ceiling players. The Bulls have a lot of solid to great players, but between subpar coaching, subpar management, and an odd team composition, they need a lot of help. Cleveland, Atlanta, Detroit, and New York lose out, dropping 2 or 3 spots as a result of the jumps by these other teams. All the other picks turned out as expected. Memphis' pick conveys to Boston.

1514,519,The Dream Team vs The Knights of the Round Ball,"Inspired by the Game of Zones 7th season where, in order to stop the threat of the Dream Team, the media chose the very best of the NBA to form the team called the Knights of the Round Ball. Excluded from the selection were Kevin Durant who is injured and Giannis who was vanquished. The media chose the following: LeBron James, Steph Curry, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Jayson Tatum, Rudy Gobert, Dame Lillard, Luka Dončić, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokić and Chris Paul. Christian Laettner was captured so he won't be in the Dream Team for the game. So the starting lineups, shown in the show, are: KOTRB: Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard and Anthony Davis/ Dream Team: Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing. The bench for the Dream Team consists of: John Stockton, Karl Malone, Clyde Drexler, Scottie Pippen, Chris Mullin and David Robinson. The KOTRB also have Doc Rivers, Brad Stevens, Mike D'Antoni and Rick Carlisle on their coaching staff while the Dream Team has Chuck Daly, P.J. Carlesimo, Mike Krzyzewski and Lenny Wilkens.  90s rules apply so allowed hand checking, no ""no charge area"" and no zone defense. 

So if these two teams would play in real life, in just one game, who would win in your opinion? Of course, it goes without saying that we're talking about the 1992 version of the Dream Team players and the current day version of the Knights of the Round Ball.",nbadiscussion
1515,520,Using 40+ years of Player Impact Plus-Minus data to visualize the best players of all time.,"[Here is a download link to the full interactive plots.](https://mega.nz/#F!9SwzCAKI!C9EkCcGYmxs3qIUhOFVneg) You can zoom in, hover over data points to see extra information and more!

**DISCLAIMER: Obviously I am not asserting that this is the definitive 'GOAT' list, or that PIPM data is the best metric to even base such a list off of- this is simply something I did for fun.**

So I was bored and threw together some plots that visualize Player Impact Plus-Minus data dating back to the 1974 season all the way to 2018, a combined total of **17615** individual player seasons.

Before I get into the results, let me give a brief overview of what Player Impact Plus-Minus is (which will be referred to PIPM from now on), and what it tries to show. PIPM is a part of the family of statistical plus-minus metrics including Adjusted Plus-Minus, Real Plus-Minus, Regularized Plus-Minus, and many more. It is a metric that includes box score priors from previous seasons, as well as factoring in what the creator calls 'luck adjusted on-off, and luck adjusted net rating.' To save you from any more statistical jargon, this metric basically attempts to improve on normal 'ol Box Plus-Minus via using regression and previous player seasons. And it's pretty accurate: holding close to a 90% correlation with RAPM. [Here is an article that goes much more in-depth](https://fansided.com/2018/01/11/nylon-calculus-introducing-player-impact-plus-minus/)[ on PIPM.](https://fansided.com/2018/01/11/nylon-calculus-introducing-player-impact-plus-minus/) Stemming from PIPM, there is also Wins Added, a metric similar to W/S that attempts to show how many wins a player added to his team across the course of a season.

So this is great and all, but who does PIPM and Wins Added like the most? Well, let's see.

&#x200B;

**Individual Seasons:**

Here is a scatter plot container all player seasons since 1974-2018. The x-axis is Wins Added and the y-axis is PIPM. The size of the circles corresponds to the games played that season (including playoffs) while the color represents the season itself.

**Career:**

Here is a scatter plot containing the averages of all players from 1974-2018. Once again the x-axis is Wins Added and the y-axis is PIPM. The size of the circles this time corresponds to the career games played for that player (including playoffs).

Some other interesting takeaways, Chris Paul coming in at the 8th spot all-time for career Wins Added, and Draymond Green having the second-highest PIPM on record at 9.98!

1516,521,[OC] The Four Factors Of Basketball Success,"tl;dr: [Here's a chart](https://imgur.com/a/FYa05CC) 

In Basketball On Paper, Dean Oliver established the four factors that lead to winning in the NBA: Shooting, Turnovers, Rebounding, and Free Throws. 

According to Oliver, shooting is the most important factor, followed by turnovers, rebounding, and free throws. Each factor has a corresponding defensive factor as a well (opponent shooting, opponent turnovers, opponent rebounding, etc...)

I took a look at the different factors for each team and plotted them as a [scatter chart](https://imgur.com/a/FYa05CC) with the offensive factor on the x-axis and the corresponding defensive factor on the y-axis. 

The shooting factor is measured using Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG%)

The turnover factor is measured using Turnover Percentage (TOV%). 

The rebounding factor is measured using Offensive and Defensive Rebound Percentage (ORB% and DRB%, respectively) 

The free throw factor is a measure of both how often a team gets to the line and how often they make them. 

I think there are some pretty interesting trends that pop out to me: 

The Wizards are shooting the hell out of the ball, but they're also allowing their opponents to score just as easily. 
 
Miami is both forcing a ton of turnovers, but also simultaneously turning the ball over themselves too much. 

The Sixers have the lowest opponent offensive rebound % and I suspect their size has a lot do with it 
 
James Harden is single handedly leading the Rockets to the highest FTA rate in the league.

1517,522,Would Nash and Dirk have won a ring together if Cuban didn’t trade Nash?,"This is brought up all the time but it’s still a fun what if. 

Do you think Dirk and Nash could’ve won a ring together if Cuban didn’t get rid of Nash? 

With Nash, the Mavs had an excellent  offense. While some superstars being paired with each other have diminishing returns (I.e. pairing an on ball PG with Lebron,) Nash and Dirk were perfectly suited for each other. 

Nash and Dirk would play pick and pop perfectly together.

Nash actually played more off ball in his Dallas days too, running off of screens. 

One of Phoenix’s biggest problems that Nash mentioned on the Bill Simmons podcast was that there was never anybody on the Suns who could create offense besides him. Nash’s offensive load and responsibility was ridiculous, and it arguably could have held him back in some ways. 

Dirk immediately solves that problem. Also, the Suns has a transcendent offense but horrible defense. The Mavs had a great offense as well as having better defense. 

What do y’all think? I argue that Nash would prob end up with one MVP rather than two but I would not be surprised if he ended up with at least one ring if he stayed.",nbadiscussion
1518,523,Zion Williamson Weaknesses and Concerns,"**Weight + Play style**

This one is obvious. He's a guy who plays above the rim but he's also 285 pounds. That the constant flying he does to dunk the ball and grab rebounds must be torture for his knees.

**Undersized**

He's a 6'7 power forward. Not laterally quick enough to guard the perimeter full time, too small to guard much much taller defenders. Put him at the 3, his lateral quickness becomes an issue. Put him at the 4, he doesn't shoot well so he can't stretch the floor causing a bit of a jam in the middle if your center can't shoot. Put him at the 5 and he'll most like be 3-6 inches shorter than the average center. And before anyone brings up the Draymond Green comparison saying that he's 6'7 and can play the 3,4,5 effectively, Green at his best is a great passer, shot 38% from 3 and played DPOY defense.

**Shooting ability**

He shot 33% from 3 and 64 % from the free throw line. He'll most likely be a below average shooter in the NBA as free throw shooting is a good indication of NBA shooting. Teams can exploit that depending on the match ups. I don't expect him to be Ben Simmons bad, but it'll be similar to any struggles that Giannis faces.

**Best moves are post moves**

Zions best moves are post hooks and post spins. In college it works because he's able to bully guys around him. But now that the NBA has guys as big or stronger than him, will it still work? Also having your best skills being your post ability at 6'7 isn't that great. 

I'm not shitting on Zion before people come in here with the wrong idea. Every player in the history of the NBA has weaknesses and concerns. He's no exceptions",nbadiscussion
1519,524,Why di you think european bigs are so good?,"It seems like in today's NBA there's a real abundance of great euro bigs, to a point that in perhaps an unprecedented way, there is almost a majority of euro among the leagues league's best bigs.

Jokic, Gobert, nurkic, porzingis, capela, gasol, Ibaka,  sabonis, vucevic, valanciunas, markkanen. Like I said, this is a new phenomenon - there have always been great euro bigs but this is really a level of dominance haven't seen before.

Why do you think that is? Without doing much research, my instincts point to that because today's NBA demands a much more diverse game from bigs compared to the past(Its not enough to post up and rebound anymore), which is a thing that european style of player training and development is a better fit for than most of the american system. But as I said, no research. What do you think?",nbadiscussion
1520,525,Possible market inefficiencies that smart organizations can take advantage of?,"I'm not an economics guy, but have been aware of this concept In a sports context , specifically as it relates to really smart organizations like the Spurs and Patriots.  

A basic rundown is this:

>An inefficient market is one that does not succeed in incorporating all available information into a true reflection of an asset's fair price. Market inefficiencies exist due to information asymmetries, transaction costs, market psychology, and human emotion, among other reasons.  As a result, some assets may be over- or under-valued in the market, creating opportunities for excess profits.

So a prime example in the nba context is how the Spurs put forth a bunch of resources on scouting Europe back around 2000 or so, long before it was common sense to scout globally .  It paid off well for them since they were able to bring in a bunch of high quality european players for pennies on the dollar

So anyways, what other possibilities are out there at this point?",nbadiscussion
1521,526,Quick Look at Scoring Preferences by Top Centers,"To display scoring preferences of Top Centers, I used the “Radar Chart”, I used the same chart couple of days ago in a [post about Celtics' Duo of the Future](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/gdaitz/celtics_have_found_their_duo_of_the_future/). 

Anyway, [here is the chart](https://i.imgur.com/O0Y12t8.png). Since I'm comparing 4 players here, the graph is a bit stacked, but we can manage to read a few things nicely.

Some Notes:
Here we are only looking at the offensive game in terms of scoring points. If we turn to the passing game, Jokic tops everyone. Misc category means ""Other points"".

Let's look at some interesting things here:

1. Anthony Davis is offensively the most versatile and better than the other listed players. He can score without the ball, through various Cutts in the offense, Pick and Roll action with LeBron and running the transition. In addition, Davis knows can play 1 on 1
either facing towards or away from the basket.

2. Embiid requires a lot of possessions in the Post-Ups. As many as 38% of his points come from Post Up. And even though he uses a lot of possessions, he's really efficient and scores 1.12 points per possession (in the post-up). This is the best number for players who have at least 1 post-up per game. Jokić is also very good in this segment and scores 1.06 points per possession and even has a slightly better shot percentage, but almost twice possessions less than Embiid.

3. KAT is an extremely good shooter, I would personally dare to say that he is even the best shooting center in a long, long time. I do not underestimate Jokić here, who is good with both threes and twos, as well as the other two guys, but Towns is simply on a different level. For the third season in a row, he is over 40% for 3 points, and this year he is shooting almost 8 of them per game. He is actually 17th in the entire league in the number of threes per game. In addition, KAT leads this quartet in both Pick-And-Roll and points after offensive rebounds.

4. Jokić does not stand out from any segment, that is, I have already praised him about the Post Up. Still he leads the others in the ""Off-Screen"" action, which is a little less relevant for the centers. But Jokić has another ability that I have already mentioned, and which cannot be seen in this graph. That is playmaking. And that is a very important and powerful skill. What can still be seen is that Jokic distributes his points to different actions, and is not a one-dimensional player.

The conclusion would be that Davis is currently the best scoring center in the league, KAT is by far the best shooter, while Embiid is a more traditional center, so to speak. Jokic, on the other hand, is a completely modern center that also has a diverse arsenal of attacking abilities.

And another very interesting question. What would Philly and Minny look like if they replaced KAT and Embiid?

1522,527,Did the Jazz’ defensive schemes against Harden in the playoffs last year directly affect their woeful shooting performances,"As most people probably know, the Jazz utilised a pretty unconventional defensive technique in last years playoffs (first used by the Bucks to stop Harden), which is explained in these videos: 

https://youtu.be/VwynmarNMkI

https://youtu.be/7ougHDwFQJU

Basically, Harden’s defender tries to force Harden to drive right, trying to induce a uncomfortable Harden layup (with Harden being a weaker right handed finisher than left) or a wide open floater(which Harden is also unspectacular with).

Whilst execution was poor for the first 2 games of the series, resulting in easy Houston wins, execution tightened up for Games 3, 4 and 5 resulting in a grind of a series with Houston’s last two wins coming by a combined total of 10 points, with a 7 point differential in favour of the Jazz over the last 3 games.

A common theme, and excuse used by Jazz fans with regards to their series is astronomically low shooting percentages across virtually the entire rotation. Some of these numbers are jaw dropping. Korver 33.3% from 3(y’all know who he is). Ricky Rubio 20% from 3(ok small sample size and a mechanically flawed shot, but a &amp;gt;30% shooter across the last 2 regular seasons and playoffs). Mitchell 25.6% from 3(also a &amp;gt;30% shooter across last two regular seasons and playoffs, shooting &amp;gt;35% in the regular season on 7 attempts a game over his regular season career). Crowder 30% from 3. Ingles 27.6% from 3(great shooter). Virtually the only player to shoot close to their career percentages was Royce O’Neale, who shot 34.8% from 3 on 23 total attempts for the series.

Now, your first thoughts may include: Jazz are a bad shooting team/small sample size/tight rims etc. I don’t dismiss all of these factors, but I will propose a hypothesis(that hopefully hasn’t been discussed at length before): the Jazz’ defensive system was the main cause of their poor shooting performance.

With the way they guarded Harden, Capela(or whoever Gobert is matched up on) sets a ball screen on Harden’s defender and Harden instantly gets a wide open floater/mid range pull-up. However, Harden doesn’t take that shot early in the shot clock, due to D’Antoni’s system favouring slow, grinding play and either 3s or layups(although I think this is a somewhat idiotic philosophy and that’s reflected by Paul who shoots plenty of ISO 2s and Harden made some clutch floaters). 

Instead, Harden can easily draw out the possession. Gobert mostly has to stay put to discourage the lob to Capela(which he often didn’t do games 1,2), so he can’t step out on Harden. Harden can easily draw back, dribble back to the 3 point line, and run the exact same action at least 2 times in the shot-clock.

Over time, being hit/fighting through tonnes of screens, and playing such high strung isolation defence against a player like Harden has an effect on fatigue and your shooting. I think this could be a contributing factor to Steph’s worst shooting performances of his career against the Cavs in the 2016 finals(where he was continuously isolated by Bron and Kyrie) and the 2018 WCF(although another reason was KD’s ISO play hindering the Warriors traditional motion offence).

And the Jazz threw plenty of perimeter defenders at Harden. I don’t use the NBA’s flawed matchup data(a rim contest by Gobert doesn’t mean he was the primary defender on Harden for a possession, despite NBA’s matchup data thinking so), and I don’t want to manually count the number of screens taken/possessions guarding Harden for Mitchell/Rubio/Royce/Ingles/Crowder across the series, but basically I do remember all of those guys guarding Harden at times and taking a fair few screens.

Now, this is just a bit of a hunch/shower thought, and to be a properly developed idea I would need to manually run through the whole series and count stuff like screens taken/possessions guarded and then compare them to previous playoff series. 
Furthermore, the Jazz shot better in the 2018 matchup between these teams, although that isn’t directly comparable as the Jazz’ defensive schemes shifted slightly between the series, and personnel was also slightly different(Exum and Burks were valuable in the 2018 series and yet didn’t see any play in 2019 due to injury/trade, whilst Rubio didn’t play the 2018 series. Impact of this: less athletic bodies to throw at Harden, e.g. Exum could fight over Harden screens and body him up very well at times esp. game 3).

But I just wanted to put this thought out there and see if anyone agreed.

TL;DR:
- running through lots of screens and defending Harden on isolation plays is tiring both mentally and physically
- The Jazz’ 2019 altered defensive scheme induced more toll taken by the individual Harden defenders
- This resulted in Jazz losing their legs which affected their shooting percentages; therefore their loss to the rockets wasn’t complete bad luck.
- If the Jazz executed properly from game 2, and had a few more athletic body to use(Exum and Mudiay for example just for 10-15 minutes a night), the series is probably considerably different
- Harden really needs to develop that floater properly because a glorified PnR drop coverage is not enough to stop tonnes of NBA guards ranging from sophomores like Collin Sexton and Devonte Graham to all stars like Conley Kemba Dipo. And yet it limited him considerably in the half court. He’s had abysmal efficiency for 2 playoff series in a row against Favors and Gobert’s drop coverage now.",nbadiscussion
1523,528,Was LeBron actually going to start at point guard for more than a couple games?,"WIth Cousins out the Lakers' starting lineup is up in the air again. But even before that I had trouble believing that James would last at PG. Unless Vogel has a brilliant plan to significantly slow down the pace of the game a soon-to-be 35 LeBron James is getting burnt on every possession by guards who will be younger and faster than him. While Danny Green will probably always pick up the opposing team's ball handler I can't imagine James being the primary defender of Buddy Hield, CJ McCollum, D'Angelo Russell, Donovan Mitchell, or the small army of young guards the Nuggets have. And while on offense he's a mismatch for most guards, the Laker's continued lack of a another reliable perimeter scorer (Green was a great signing, but 10 ppg isn't going to demand a lot of attention) means it's simple for teams to rotate their best wing defender onto James.

1525,530,Did Russell Westbrook steal his own Thunder?,"When Russell Westbrook won the MVP award in 2017, he solidified himself as the standalone candidate by capping off a historical season by setting the new single season triple double record.

That season he had blown voters away by being the first player since Oscar Robinson in 1962 to average a triple double. This could be simplified by saying “in the modern era of basketball.”

The beating of the record and the emergence as a true historical season seemed to lock Westbrook for MVP at that exact point in time. However, not only has Westbrook done it again, but he has done it for three consecutive seasons. He was not a top three finalist in either of the following seasons.

And before you mention record or the more conditional aspects of the award, the Thunder finished 6th in the West his MVP season, further leading me to believe that this was a more statistical merit (at least, more than usual, as Westbrook was still obviously the rock to his team)

Sure, the emergence of the triple double has been more than notable in the modern NBA: From the 1991–92 to the 2014–15 season, there were only 841 triple-doubles, or about 35.04 triple-doubles per season. In the 2015–16 season, the number of triple-doubles recorded in the NBA grew from 46 to 75. From the 2016–17 to the 2018–19 season, the NBA recorded 352 triple doubles.

However, it still cannot help but seem that Westbrook in a way outdid himself. Especially after the season Harden just had, it makes Westbrook’s case that much more curious. What do you think? Was Westbrook his own greatest opponent in the MVP race?",nbadiscussion
1526,531,"How do we explain Sixers having 3 ""elite"" defenders but being a bang average defensive team?","We hear that Embiid is a ""DPOY Candidate"", we hear that Simmons is an elite defender, and we know that Butler is an elite defender.

Yet despite this they are 14th in defensive rating and 26th in the league in points allowed in the paint.

Something has got to give, you can't have 3 defensive stoppers and be average defensively. Other teams don't. Vast majority of other teams don't have more than 3 offensive threats to make JJ and Tobi liabilities. Other teams also have their own defensive liabilities. Other teams also have their own scrubs on the bench. 

I'll posit that Ben and Joel aren't actually elite defenders. They may be good one-on-one defenders, but they are poor team defenders with poor basketball IQ and poor concentration that get caught sleeping and in rotations, and give up buckets that the narrative doesn't penalize them for - that the narrative is swift to aggrandize their stops but doesn't punish their lapses. 

For a historical comparison, Dwight Howard anchored statistically elite defensive teams with 3-4 starters that were absolute sieves. In 2010 it was Rashard, Vince, Jameer, backed up by White Chocolate, his own back-up was a young Gortat. In 2008 he had Rashard, Turkoglu and Arroyo.

EDIT: Since a lot of people seem upset at the suggestion that Embiid's status as an ""elite defender"" is in question, since 2008 the highest points allowed in the paint ranking of a big man DPOY has been 8th, and all other winners except that one had top 3. Similarly, all of the DPOY winners in that timespan, big or small, anchored top 5 defenses. In 2007 they gave it to Camby for leading the league in blocks.",nbadiscussion
1527,532,Why were Oklahoma City so underrated going into this season?,"ESPN gave OKC a 0.1% chance of making the playoffs at the start of the season. They are currently 14-14, for 7th place in the west, and sit 2 games ahead of 9th seed.

Obviously it's easy to look back in hindsight, but this team on paper is not bad at all. 

How can a starting five of Paul, Gilgeous Alexander, Ferguson, Gallinari and Adams be given a 0.1% chance of being a top 8 team in the west?

Is it because the ""experts"" thought CP3, Gallinari and Adams would be traded for draft picks, and they would ultimately tank the whole season? Also, it probably helps that GSW, Spurs, Kings and Blazers have been considerably worse than anticipated.

OKC may still trade some of their key players away in the coming weeks, and tank the rest of the season. However, my point still stands that giving a team a 0.1% chance of making the playoffs when they have a good starting 5, and underrated bench (Schroder, Noel, Bazley) is ridiculous.",nbadiscussion

What can we conclude from this

* Taking the 6th, and 5th spot are the Rockets. The Houston Rockets shoot a shit ton of three, but are not as efficient as the other 4 teams on this list. Not one of their players on both years shot over 40% from 3.
* The 4th spot goes to the Warriors. The Warriors were carried super hard by Curry and Klay. It just shows how great they are as shooters. Barnes also shot 40% as well, but the efficiency of Curry and Klay is crazy, especially when considering that only 3 out of their 15 players shot over 35%
* 3rd place goes to the Magic. While the Warriors are higher in volume and efficiency. The **team** as a whole was poor shooting outside the 3 mentioned. The Magic edge them out because they have more 3 point threats.
* 2nd place goes to the Knicks. Their argument against the Warriors is the same as Orlando. They have more volume than the Warriors but less efficiency. But the team as a whole has better shooting. If either Klay or Steph sits that half their shooting power right there. As for the the Magic, they had 50 more makes on the same efficiency. Just a bit better.
* 1st place in my opinion is the Phoenix Suns. It just shows how ahead of their time they were. They were the most efficient team, just had the lowest volume. But when you account for the time period that they played this is fucking amazing. They have 3 out of the 5 most efficient players in this post. That Phoenix team was special

1529,534,2010s All-Decade Defensive Teams (2009-19),"The NBA.com website had already released the All-Decade Teams a while ago, which can be found [here](https://www.nba.com/all-decade-team-best-players-2010s). This sub has already discussed those teams [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cmks62/the_nbacom_alldecade_teams_had_some_really_bad/), but what has not been discussed has been a hypothetical All-Decade Defensive Teams.

Finally, [here](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/year/2014/sort/DRPM) are the players with the highest DRPM from this decade starting from the 2013-14 season. In my honest opinion, though, the eye test trumps all of that.

**Edit:** Added Al Horford & Trevor Ariza to the notable exclusions. Swapped Iguodala and Bradley's spots on the peak list.

**Edit 2:** I've gotten a lot of insightful comments that helped me re-consider some things on my list. If I had to do a re-do, I'd put 2010-11 KG on the peak all-defensive squad to replace 2013-14 Paul George. Additionally, I'd replace 2015-16 Avery Bradley with 2018-19 Marcus Smart due to his positional versatility. I'd also replace Andre Roberson in the all-decade defensive teams list with Marcus Smart, due to Smart playing more games, despite Roberson's insane peak. One last thing I'd like to address is the center spot for the all-defensive peak team. This spot is very deserving of going to numerous players. Here are my candidates: 2012-13 Marc Gasol, 2012-13 Tim Duncan, 2011-12 Tyson Chandler, and 2014-15 Andrew Bogut. Consider all these guys honorable members of the center spot for the peak all-defensive 3rd team.",nbadiscussion
1530,535,I have a few ideas for how the CBA could be modified to better incentivize players to stay in small markets.,"As we've seen lately, the most recent efforts to keep stars in small markets doesnt really help, and at worst they will sign the supermax and then demand a trade out of there anyway. 

Designated Player Tag
1) My first idea (these arent 100% fleshed out, moreso general ideas) is to have teams able to give a ""designated franchise player"" type tag to 1 player and have their salary exceed normal max percentages but only affect the salary cap at a locked percentage. 

For example: let's say Kemba decided to resign in CHA, they would give him the DFP tag and then let's say it allows them to pay him 30% more than the max he is currently allowed. That 30% extra wont count towards the salary cap so they arent hindered by the MASSIVE chunk of cap space that the current supermax takes up. 


No Trade Clause for Teams
2) The second idea goes with the first one but could also be it's own thing for the supermax or whatever. 
My suggestion is that when a player signs the DFP or supermax they are automatically put into a no trade clause for the first 2 years or half of the contract (or some period of time that works better) but instead of the player controlling the trade clause, it makes neither the team or the player able to make the decision to trade until the arbitrary period of time is reached. I think this could get rid of any ""sign and dash"" deals where the superstar signs for the money and then demands a trade shortly after.

In the life cycle of most prevalent memes or circlejerks the community in which the information is propagating reaches a point of annoyance. There is a backlash (counterjerk/meme fatigue).
  
We are clearly at this point concerning the information that Karl Malone impregnated a 13 year old. There was a Karl thread today and all mention of this information was heavily downvoted. Now the counterjerk posits that anyone posting about Malones evil deed is simply hunting for karma. People are exploiting Malones crime as a karma grab.
  
I am not convinced. This info used to be one of those little known facts that was brought up in the middle of a long comment chain about a subject. I remember reading about it many years ago on reddit. Lately, whether by the cultural wave of #metoo or pure coincidence this information about Karl is being shared at a much more rapid pace.
  
You could argue karma is involved with every post on reddit. And some karma whoring is obvious and transparent. I dont think the posts about Karl Malone are obvious karma whoring. I think we are in a cultural moment sensitive to male abuse of women and people are responding to this information as part of a broader phenomenon. This is a specific case that connects a popular figure in the NBA to something larger. People are naturally going to latch onto this information and keep it ready to disseminate.
  
There is raw emotion surrounding this issue. I think there are many people that don't care if they get karma or not when they post the Karl thing. They want the whole world to know what this man did. It's their little crusade on their lunch break. It may seem trivial but I believe this kind of action is a net positive. We need culture to spam outrage and disdain at sexual abuse. Those with power should be scared to take advantage of others. We are changing the world with all this social activity around the issue. I know women in my life who note a marked difference over the last decade in how they are treated in public. Shits not perfect by any means but we are making progress IMO.
  
Anyway. I dont feel bad for Karl getting shat on thread by thread. He deserves it, and Im not so sure people are motivated solely by karma to do so. It's pertinent that it's being shared a lot *now*. There is a large question at play here as well - should Rose/Bryant and others get a pass or the same treatment? The situation for each individual case is unique and complicated but I am open to any take on the matter.",nbadiscussion

1536,541,"Breakdown of Brogdon versus Bledsoe, and what the Bucks' offseason outcome means for their future","Bucks fan and an aspiring NBA content creator here. I've been wanting to carve out a role for myself in the realm of making content for others who share the same passion of the NBA as me. Here's my first, really long-winded NBA article. It's my take on Bucks' decision to not re-sign Malcolm Brogdon, how the Eric Bledsoe extension has aged, and how those two scenarios compare. I know this topic has been spoken about a ton, but I've been working on this for a long while. I would love to hear you positive or negative feedback on my first NBA piece.

Honestly, I can't figure you a better way to share this, so I'm just pasting the story in the text below:

The Milwaukee Bucks ended the 2018-19 NBA season with a league-best 60 regular season wins and only two wins away from their first finals appearance in 46 years. Even after losing the last four games of the eastern conference finals, there’s still plenty of optimism remaining for the organization. They still have the reigning MVP, coach of the year, executive of the year, and most of the starting lineup from their previous recent historic season. Unfortunately, the odd man out from that prolific starting five is 2017 rookie of the year, Malcolm Brogdon.

Leading up to last season, all of the Bucks’ starters except Giannis Antetokounmpo didn’t have a contract secured for this season. Then Eric Bledsoe signed his four-year $70 million-dollar contract on March 4, 2019, which many analysts believed to be a bargain at the time. However, after Bledsoe failed to perform to his capabilities in the playoffs for the second year in a row, owner of The Ringer, Bill Simmons, and other speculators wondered if the Bucks would take that extension back if they could. Obviously, hindsight is 20/20, and keeping a point guard who was producing at a fringe all-star level for less than $20 million annually at the time of the signing will not kill a team’s future to say the least. However, when a team’s aspirations are an NBA championship, their margin of error becomes exceedingly smaller.

Bucks fans fear that Bledsoe’s inconsistent shooting in the playoffs could continue to impede the Bucks’ offense and stop them short of an NBA finals appearance once again. Spacing the floor around Giannis is key to maintaining a top five offensive for years to come, and Bledsoe has the biggest question mark around his shooting respectability among last year’s starting lineup, excluding Giannis. The Bucks ended last season with the fourth-best offensive rating, and through 11 games this year, they rank sixth in that respect. Eventually, the debate in Milwaukee became whether the franchise should’ve bet on the higher ceiling of Eric Bledsoe’s more unique ability to effectively blow up any screen and keep up with the NBA’s elite guards, or the higher floor of Malcolm Brogdon’s efficient shooting and size to defend more positions. Even if it wasn’t clear at the time, Bledsoe signing on the dotted line also meant that Brogdon couldn’t do the same three months later.

Brogdon being a restricted free agent at the end of last season means that the idea of the Bucks’ inability to bring him back is technically a total fallacy. For those unfamiliar, when a free agent is restricted, that means the team that he last played for can “match” any amount that he would agree to with another team, even if that means exceeding the salary cap to keep him. A benefit to letting a restricted free agent go out and seek another offer is avoiding overpaying the player, and usually retaining them at closer to market value with no real risk of unintentionally losing them. That being said, another team with more flexibility and less at stake than a championship contender can still overpay any free agent and acquire a talent they maybe couldn’t by presenting them a salary number they can’t refuse. Therefore, restricted free agency is very much a double-edged sword when dealing with a player who deserves a material amount of the salary cap, but is not at a no-brainer maximum contract level. Sure, it’s troubling to know your team lost an important piece. However, restricted free agency does not exempt any team from luxury tax repercussion. Therefore, if a player’s pay-raise means a loss of flexibility in the future, that could be just as detrimental to long-term success, as losing a quality performer is for the present day.

Not re-signing a player of Brogdon’s quality is certainly not a winning move for the Bucks when solely considering this year’s title hopes. Even the advanced floor spacing and veteran leadership that Wesley Mathews and Kyle Korver bring can’t replace the impact Brogdon had as a secondary ball handler. Especially when looking at the rest of the Bucks’ roster, Mathews and Korver add more to a now redundant strength of the team (shooting), versus replacing what was lost in the offseason (Brogdon’s ballhandling and paint penetration). However, dodging the luxury tax this year can also be seen as a sign of the organization maintaining the long-view, instead of failing to prioritize winning.

Although Brogdon may be less likely to directly cost the Bucks an NBA finals appearance, what some Bucks fans tend to forget is that only $3.9 million of Bledsoe’s $19.375 million salary is guaranteed for his age 32 season in 2022. The sign-and-trade deal that sent Malcolm Brogdon and his brand 4 year/$85 million contract to Indiana included a 2020 lottery-protected 1st round draft pick and 2nd round picks in two consecutive years. Bledsoe clearly has the better contract, and nowadays, teams rarely receive draft compensation from teams taking their players in free agency.

Staying within the margin of error of the modern NBA means optimizing your roster construction to be flexible enough face any team the league with throw at you (a la the current Eastern Conference and NBA champion Toronto Raptors). The roster that eventually broke apart the dynastic Golden State Warriors with five starters who could defend and shoot at at least a respectable level. The Bucks starters are similar now in the way they joined the rest of the league in valuing three point shooting offensively and forcing other teams into taking shots from less efficient areas of the floor. However, last year’s Eastern Conference Finals showed how being outmatched in three-point shooting and shot creation can easily stagnate an NBA offense.

The greatest advantage to having a player like Brogdon, despite the low ceiling of an upperclassman drafted in the second round, is his versatility. In the eastern conference finals, and during the regular season when he was healthy, he showed the ability to seamlessly scale up to the second banana when Middleton and Bledsoe were having off nights, while also fitting in well as a fourth guy, who would spread the floor, and effectively defend wingmen. While thinking of the loss of Brogdon often coincides with the uncertainly of Bledsoe’s performance, maybe speculators should consider if the shorter ceiling of Brogdon’s skillset through the lens of championship aspirations could be just as much, if not more of a hinderance the Bucks’ future title chances.

There seems to be a lot of negative feelings towards the size of Middleton’s new contract, especially when thinking of him as the de-facto second option, but the reality is the possibility of finding another all-star to pair with Giannis in- or out-of-house was much less likely. Brogdon has the skill to step into the role of the second-best player on a 60-win team, but not for 82 games plus playoffs. He also has the ability to defend the other team’s best offensive wingman, but not at an all-defensive level like Bledsoe. He has been surely missed by the organization, but he had to be considered 3rd on the priority list, behind Middleton and Bledsoe, of who the Bucks should’ve re-signed. This is ultimately because he checks a lot of boxes as a jack of all trades, but respectively isn’t more of a master at any skill than the two guys that were above him on the priority list.

Through 11 games, the small-sample-size theater presents Eric Bledsoe producing 17.6-5.5-5.3 on 50-29-80% shooting, and Malcolm Brogdon providing 19-4.8-8 at 46-30.8-98%. Despite the slight drop in efficiency from his 50-40-90% shooting season, Brogdon is proving so far that his able to give really respectable output in an increased role. It’s even more fun now to compare Brogdon and Bledsoe’s career now that they’ve both been in situation with larger roles on non-contending teams (Brogdon- Now Indiana & Bledsoe-Phoenix ’14-’16) and teams with championship hopes (Brogdon - ’19 Bucks & Bledsoe – ’11-’13 Clippers/ ’19-Present Bucks). Bucks and other NBA fans will lose their minds, talking in circles, like myself, comparing the timelines of each player on and off the Bucks’ current roster, but the reality of either player making or breaking the future of the Larry O’Brien trophy residing in the Good Land in overblown. So Bucks fans, like Wisconsin’s other savior said “R-E-L-A-X”. The Bucks ended up with the best, or second-best realistic possible starting lineup post-free agency (depending on how one feels about Brook Lopez (story for another day)). They also sit in comfortable spot to resign the Greek God this summer and have more flexibility to keep a respectable team around him for years to come. Milwaukee wishes their forever-President, Malcolm all the best. They also sincerely regret to hear that he is doubtful for tonight’s contest in Indiana with a sore back per the Pacers' injury report today, and won’t be blessed with the first ever Bledsoe-Brogdon matchup in an NBA contest for even further speculation.

- Joe L.

tldr: I've been hearing on podcasts since free agency how the Bucks made a terrible decision not re-signing Brogdon, and it was a decision made while not prioritizing winning. That is totally fair, but what lacks consideration is the quality of Bledsoe's contract and the eventual repeater tax for the organization.",nbadiscussion
1537,542,How Potent Were The 2011 - 2014 Miami Heat?,"As the years progress, it seems that basketball fans are forgetting the strength of those Miami Heat teams (""Heatles""). Most NBA fans tend to significantly overrate or underrate those Miami teams based on a variety of biases. Based on the statistical evidence, media perspective, strength of opponents, and overall potential how should we rate that team? What year did they peak and did that core maximize on their talent? What more could have been done to maximize that core if they did not exactly reach their ceiling?",nbadiscussion
1538,543,What should the Hawks do with John Collins?,"Fascinating situation made more complex after the Hawks recent moves. 

Collins has one more season remaining on his rookie contract before becoming a restricted free agent. Atlanta will have close to $75M in cap space in 2021, assuming that cap doesn’t move as a result of the COVID-19 situation. I believe Collins is eligible for up to a 4 year/~120M deal (25% max contract). 

Collins has been good, like really good, since Trae got to ATL. Basically 20/10 in the last two seasons on very good efficiency. His true shooting was 66% this season, and he even hit over 40% (!) of his 3s on nearly 4 attempts per game. Very impressive offensively, and seems like a great fit with Trae Young as a P&R partner. 

On the other end, it’s another story. Collins hasn’t been able to be a center on defense without it being a complete disaster. He’s a bit small, and isn’t an elite rim protector. I don’t think anyone in Atlanta is comfortable with him as the five long term, especially when considering their recent acquisition of Capella and Dedmon. 

Those moves would make it seem like the Hawks plan on having Collins play the four. On the surface, that would seem to reduce his effectiveness greatly. Collins’ best abilities are his roll ability and finishing, and he’s able to build his three point shooting pick and pop game off of that. It would seem that Collins would be a lot more effective offensively without Capella and with more space. On defense, it might help Collins to have Capella behind him, but I’d think that bump wouldn’t make up for the offensive drop from the lack of spacing with Collins at the 4.

Numbers back this up. Per Cleaning the Glass, Collins and the Hawks had a offensive rating of 112 when he played at center, close to tops in the league. When he plays the four, that drops to 103. The defense does get better when playing next to a center, allowing a 116 defensive rating with Collins at center and only 111.5 with him at the four. 

So the defense gets 4.5 points better with him at the four, but the offense gets 9 points worse. A net effect of -4.5 pts/100 possessions with Collins playing the four instead of the five. 

So with that in mind, what do the Hawks do next summer? Do they match any offer because they’ve got more cap space than they know what to do with? Does Collins get a max, or anywhere close? Do they maybe try and trade Collins?",nbadiscussion

1540,545,Giannis Antetokounmpo’s case for 2019-2020 NBA defensive player of the year.,"Giannis scoring, dominance, and playmaking are talked about plenty, but his defense is as impressive as his offense. 

Since coming 2nd in DPOY voting to Rudy Gobert last year, it looks like Giannis has seemingly improved more on the defensive end this year too. Statistically speaking, Giannis is:

1. #1 in defensive rating with a 95.9 rating. Brook Lopez is #2 at 98.2. 

2. #1 in defensive win shares at 2.7. Anthony Davis is #2 at 2.3. 

3.  #3 in defensive box plus minus at 4.8. Nerlens Noel leads at 5.5,  but only plays 18 minutes a game. Jonathan Issac edges Giannis with a 5.0.

4. 6th in rebounds per game (13.0 a game) and 9th in defensive rebounding percentage.

5. 37th in steals per game (1.3 per game) , tied for 24th in blocks per game (1.2 per game), and is tied for 50th in deflections per game (2.4 per game).

6. Opponents are shooting 38.9 percent from the field, when guarded by Giannis. Most notably his rim protection, where he is only allowing 43.7 percent shooting less than 6 feet, where his opponents usual shoot 59.1 percent from less than 6 feet. 

7. Milwaukee Bucks are the #1 defense in the league. They are #1 in Defensive Rating by 3 points, #1 in rebounds, allow the fewest 2nd Chance points in the league, fewest points per game in the paint, and the Bucks are allowing a league best 41 percent field goal percentage. 

8. He’s the best defensive player on the best defensive team in the league. I know Lopez is an elite rim protector, but Giannis is still the defensive anchor and best overall defender on the team. His versatility from being able to guard 1-5, to being able to completely shut down pick and rolls and transition defense, the rim protection and off ball movement rotations he completes, and the athleticism to stay with smaller, shiftier players. Bledsoe is an elite perimeter defender, but Milwaukee played without him for over 2 weeks, and they still held the top defense in the league. Giannis overall, is the clear best defender on the best defensive team, and going by the nature of the award, this is a very strong argument for Giannis. 

9. I know this is unscientific and more opinion based, but he completely passes the eye test too. The effort, non stop hustle, the defensive instincts, and versatility are all there. He’s a very high IQ defensive player, has really good defensive technique, and he is uniquely gifted with his size and athleticism, which gives him insane versatility. 


Question:


Giannis is the favorite to win the MVP currently. Do you think him winning the MVP could impact his DPOY chances? Or do you think voters would be inclined to give Giannis the chance to become the 2nd player in history to possibly win DPOY, MVP, and finals MVP in history, while solidifying himself as the best current player in the game?

1542,547,[OC] Visualizing Variance: Which Stars are the Most Consistent Scorers?,"Hey guys, I posted this on the nba subreddit a few days back. It got a little bit of traction (topped out at 550 upvotes or so, hit the very bottom of the front page for about an hour), but the response from people who saw it was great so I wanted to post it here just in case you guys missed it. Let me know what you think! There were a lot of requests  in the comments of that post asking about other players that I didn't include (giannis, old and young melo, prime MJ, Kobe, comparing OKC KD and GSW KD, and others.) If you're curious about those or have a request, just let me know and I'll try to get back to you quickly.

&nbsp;

This is a very long post. There will be a TL;DR at the end, but please be careful, the TL;DR is just an overview and there is a lot of nuance to this post. Please also read the ""Cautions"" Section! There are scatter plots at the bottom of each chart that help summarize the data, click on those to get an idea of what some of the conclusions are.

Keep in mind that a lot of the decisions in this post *are* arbitrary, and I do my best to point them out. 

I do try to make any discussion of stats intuitive and easy to understand, and I try to use clear hypotheticals or examples to explain any points that I make.

&nbsp;

#Motivation
A topic that really interests me (and probably interests you) is the night-to-night consistency of certain players; many people on this subreddit would be quick to tell you that players like  Chris Paul and Kevin Durant are very consistent, whereas players like Klay Thompson and Paul George are very inconsistent or ""streaky"". But what do we mean by consistency? How do we measure consistency? And what do we want from it? That's what we'll explore in this post.

&nbsp;

#Introduction and Previous Literature

There was a cool post about boxplots of scorers a while back, seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4c7z63/scoring_consistency/). It's a really cool post, but I have no idea how his boxplots were so much more clear and representative than mine. Probably because I'm a shit programmer. Oh well. Check out the post regardless. 



There was also a post about 10 months back (thanks to user anti_thon for making me aware of it and finding it for me) about the consistency of Paul George. You can find it here if you'd like to read it: https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/80glzp/oc_paul_georges_consistency_vs_other_top_scorers/


There are some things in that post that I wanted to improve on when I made this post: 

&nbsp;

1.) It only analyzed the first 61 games of the 17-18 season.

2.) It is slightly biased towards players who score less. 

3.) The counter of games above or below 55% TS is an unnecessary and perhaps misleading criterion.

4.) It's not visually informative or appealing.

&nbsp;

Let me make it clear that I'm not trying to trash the post; it's a good, high effort post that sparked discussion and provided information previously unavailable on this subreddit. However, I think more work can be done in the area, and I want to highlight the things that my post will aim to achieve. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

There are a lot of other related posts, but most of them run into the issues above.

#Who, When, Why, and How?

To do this project, I picked 12 players (KD, Curry, LeBron, Harden, Westbrook, Kyrie, Butler, PG, Chris Paul, Klay Thompson, DeMar DeRozan, and Anthony Davis) and took data from the last 3 full seasons (15-16, 16-17, 17-18)

&nbsp;

Why these players? Well, mostly because they're the first 12 that I thought of. I wanted to stick mostly with players who are capable shooters (sorry, giannis), I wanted a mix of high 20s ppg players and low 20 ppg players, I wanted players who have known ""reputations"" of consistency (KD, CP) or inconsistency (PG, Klay), and I wanted players who have played at a relatively ""steady"" level for the last 3 years (again, sorry giannis). 12 seemed like a good number, so I didn't include Dame (shrug).


&nbsp;


Most of the work was programmed in Julia, and all stats were obtained from basketball-reference. At the highest level, I made text files of the CSV files from bball reference's game logs, read them into Julia, stripped the stats that I wanted to use, and concatenated them into arrays that contained that player's last 3 seasons worth of stats.



&nbsp;

#Method 1: Boxplots

A classic way to display this data would be to use box plots. Boxplots show a lot of information in an intuitive way; the line in the middle is the median, the bottom edge of the box is the first quartile, the top edge of the box is the third quartile, and the ""whiskers"" are the minimum and maximum values. Any points outside of this whisker zone are determined to be ""outliers"".

Here are 4 links to the boxplots for these players. I grouped the 6 highest ppg players and the lowest 6 ppg players to make it slightly easier to compare between players. Same goes for the TS plots; 6 highest TS% players and 6 lowest are grouped.

#[PPG Boxplots](https://imgur.com/a/omvAFdL)

#[TS Boxplots](https://imgur.com/a/rpjqy9j)

So, why not stop here? We have the information we need, apparently. Well, the boxplots give a good general overview of the data, but it's not immediately clear what this is telling us:


It seems like we can say that AD and DeMar have the tightest spread of TS%, and LeBron and KD have the tightest spread of PPG, but outside of that, it's hard to say.

&nbsp;

Can we say anything definitive about, for example, the difference between Klay and Butler? Or PG and Westbrook? It's not immediately clear or intuitive what to take from this particular set of boxplots, or what we mean by consistency. 

&nbsp;

These are all questions I asked myself while doing the analysis, so I decided to see if comparing with another method might make things more clear.



#Method 2: Relative Standard Deviation

One of the methods in Paul George post I mentioned earlier was to look at the standard deviation of PPG and TS%. This can present problems when you're comparing players with differenct PPG and TS% averages. For an extreme example, take an 8 ppg player. In half the games, he scores 1 point. In the other half, he scores 15 points. This is extremely inconsistent in the sense that we're getting nowhere near what we *expect* from this player on a given night. Despite this, his standard deviation of PPG would be 7, which is in-line with the values of other players in the original post. Again, this is an extreme example to illustrate a greater point: we should normalize around averages.

&nbsp;

A simple way to achieve this is to use relative standard deviations. The formula is quite simple: RSD = 100\*(SD/Mean)

The output of this is a percentage that tells you the value of your standard deviation as a percentage of your mean. If you have a low percentage, that means that your data is tightly clustered around your mean. 

&nbsp;

With our hypothetical 8 ppg scorer, we can use to formula to determine that his RSD is 100\*7/8 = 87.5%, which is extremely high; something we would expect to see, given his night to night scoring values, but might not notice if we didn't mathematically adjust for his low scoring. 

&nbsp;

Here are the results of this method:

Rank | Player| RSD of PPG
---------|----------|----------
1 | Kevin Durant | 25.84%
2 | LeBron James | 25.87%
3 | James Harden | 29.98%
4 | Steph Curry | 32.75%
5 | DeMar DeRozan | 33.68%
6 | Anthony Davis | 35.98%
7 | Kyrie Irving | 36.01%
8 | Russell Westbrook | 36.20%
9 | Paul George | 36.40%
10 | Klay Thompson | 36.76%
11 | Chris Paul | 36.85%
12 | Jimmy Butler | 39.26%

&nbsp;


Rank | Player| RSD of TS%
---------|----------|----------
1 | LeBron James | 18.00%
2 | James Harden | 19.56%
3 | Kevin Durant | 19.76%
4 | Anthony Davis | 20.10%
5 | DeMar DeRozan | 21.08%
6 | Stephen Curry | 22.15%
7 | Russell Westbrook | 23.06%
8 | Klay Thompson | 24.64%
9 | Paul George | 24.72%
10 | Chris Paul | 25.17%
11 | Jimmy Butler | 26.02%
12 | Kyrie Irving | 26.14%

#[And here is the scatter plot, for more clarity](https://imgur.com/a/h22dMGp)


From here, we start to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Clearly, just like in the boxplots, Lebron and Durant are in a tier of their own, with Harden not far behind, Curry, Davis, and DeRozan make up a group, and the rest lag behind.

&nbsp;

This still may not be completely satisfactory for you, however, depending on how you look at consistency. As a player and as a spectator, you might really only care about consistency insofar as is pertains to *bad* games. If you score your averages almost every night, but every once in a while go off for 50, it's a much less negative context than scoring your averages almost every night,  but every so often EXPLODING for exactly zero points. Both might be ""equally"" inconsistent, but we'd all much prefer the former.


&nbsp;

In other words: which players are going to almost guarantee you a ""solid"" game?

#Method 3: Games Below Threshold

I don't know what this method is normally called. I called it ""Games Below Threshold"" in my program. 

&nbsp;

The basic idea of it is to look at the percentage of games that are below a certain quality. Clearly, there's a lot of subjectivity in this, so let me be clear and explain that I made this with *my* idea of what the threshold might be. Yours might be different, and that's not necessarily wrong.

&nbsp;

The way I wrote the program was to mark the games in the array that were below the threshold, and then calculate the ratio of marked games to unmarked games. The threshold is the median of that player's PPG multiplied by some adjuster between 0 and 1. For example, you might set it so that you need at least 22 points for it to be an ""okay"" game. There are a couple things to keep in mind here:

1.) A good game for one person might be a bad game for another person. 22 points for Klay Thompson is good. Not so much for Kevin Durant. We need to be able to adjust for this, which is why we use each player's individual PPG and TS% averages. Not league averages.

2.) We're keeping in mind that outlier games shouldn't hurt you, in the sense that scoring 60 is technically inconsistent, but we don't care so much. That's why I opted to use a median instead of an average. 

&nbsp;


#I still don't get the second point (skip this if you don't care)
To explain the second point further, consider a hypothetical player A who scores 25 ppg 90% of the time, and 60 points 10% of the time (28.5 ppg). Now consider player B who scores 32 ppg 70% of the time, and 20 30% of the time (28.4 ppg).

&nbsp;

If our arbitrary threshold of a ""solid"" game is their average ppg\*0.9 (meaning that if that player scores at least 90% of their average PPG in a given game, we call it ""solid""), then player A only has a solid game (28.5\*0.9 = 25.65 points) 10% of the time (when he scores 60). Player B has a solid game 70% of the time, on the other hand.


&nbsp;

If we use the median, then a ""solid game"" for player A is (median\*0.9) = 25\*0.9 =22.5 points. Then we can say that player A is *always* guaranteeing you at least a solid game.

Whereas for player B, (median\*0.9) = 28.8 points, so player B is guaranteeing you a solid game still 70% of the time.

&nbsp;


I've said this before but it bears repeating: this is an extreme example to illustrate a greater point. If your idea of a consistent player is contingent on NOT having bad games, then this method achieves that by avoiding potential pitfalls listed above


&nbsp;

#So what is the actual method? What are your thresholds?

For PPG, the threshold I went with is the median of that player's PPG, multipled by .7407. Why that number? It's completely arbitrary. For a 27 PPG scorer (think Kevin Durant, Steph, Lebron) 27*0.7407 = 19.9989. 

&nbsp;

So if you're a 27 PPG scorer, this method finds every game in your log where you have less than 20 points, and marks it as below the threshold. Again, why this number? Completely arbitrary and based on my preferences. When I see the boxscore and see that LeBron, KD, or Steph scored less than 20 points, it sticks out in my mind and I think ""Huh, not a great scoring game"". That's usually the mark. I think other people on the subreddit share a similar idea of a ""solid"" game, since many people think of Kevin Durant and LeBron as basically guaranteeing you at least a 20 point game, every time.

&nbsp;

Similarly, when a 20 ppg player has less than 15 points in a game, it sticks out to me in the same way. That's why I picked that number, and if you don't like that, that's totally fine.

&nbsp;

For TS%, I had less of an intuition of what to pick. I ended up going with 0.85\*median(TS%); that's the number where steph curry is at about league average TS%.

#How does it turn out?

#[And here is the scatter plot for more clarity](https://imgur.com/a/Y2bIH86)



The way to read this is to pick a player, look at what % their dot corresponds to. The % means that percentage of games where a player shoots below their personal ""threshold"".


#*Conclusions and Discussion*

Clearly, there's a lot to what goes into what makes a player consistent. It would be extremely easy to get into an argument with someone about which player is more consistent, glance at the tables until you find one that proves your point, and cite it in your argument.

What's crucial here is defining what you care about in consistency, and what you're valuing.

* Do you want your player to be close to their scoring averages every night?
* Do you want your player to have the smallest amount of ""bad"" games? What exactly *is* a bad game to you?
* Do you want your player to be efficient night in and night out, regardless of the points? Or do you just care that the player gets the points?
* Do you care if a player is *relatively* close to their average (i.e., Relative Std. Dev)? Or do you want consistency on a flat basis (i.e., Std. Dev)?

That being said, there are some patterns here that clearly indicate results and certain tiers of consistency. Some things that stuck out

* Kyrie seems determined to get his points, regardless of efficiency. It could be that it's just due to him being the ""closer"" on his team. He's the guy, and he's probably the best option if you need to find a bucket in a close game.

* On the other side of things, Anthony Davis seems determined to only go for what he is given; his RSD for his efficiency is low, but he has a relatively wide range of points for a given game. It could be interpreted that he's content to not force shots.

* Chris Paul is remarkably inconsistent in almost every metric, which is surprising given his reputation, and Paul George is not much better.



#Cautions with interpreting this data and things not addressed

Despite how much effort went into this project, there are a lot of things that I could do better next time (or that someone else could, if they choose to improve upon this in the future). Things to remember when looking at this data and post:

* This does not make any statements about defense, play-making, aggregate stats, or any other aspect of the game. Just the consistency of scoring and efficiency on a night to night basis.

* This method did not account for games where a player was injured and left the game early. This adds a few low scoring games for players like Anthony Davis and Curry, which may have very slightly impacted results. 

* This does not take into account the context of the season that surrounded each player. Paul George went from a first option to a second option in the middle of this data set. Klay Thompson went from a 2nd to a 3rd option, and often doesn't *need* to have as many games ""above the threshold"", so to speak. There's always more information behind the numbers.

* All these players are on different teams, in different systems, accomplishing different goals, sometimes other than scoring. I tried to adjust for the things that I could, like differences in average PPG, but you can never account for every variable.

* Remember that this is the last 3 seasons only!

* This is only comparing superstar players!



#TL;DR

* Chris Paul is a surprisingly inconsistent scorer 
* DeMar DeRozan is a surprisingly (to me) consistent scorer
* LeBron James is a predictably consistent scorer
* Kevin Durant is an absurdly consistent scorer
* If you need 20 points, Kevin Durant will get it almost 90% of the time.
* Paul George is (unsurprisingly?) not that consistent at scoring (but better than you think; more consistent than Kyrie and Butler)
* Jimmy Butler is an inconsistent scorer
* Kyrie will consistently get you points, but it might not be consistently efficient (similarly for Westbrook)
* Anthony Davis will consistently be efficient, but he might not consistently get you points
* Harden, LeBron, and Curry form a nice tier of consistency after Kevin

In terms of isolation scoring, James Harden is king to nobody's surprise. Not only is he the most efficient iso scorer in this list, but isolation accounts for 46% of his playstyle, far higher than anyone in the top 10. Also, at high volume, only seven players guarantee a point per iso play on average: Harden, DeRozan, Jrue, Dame, Kawhi, Luka and D'Lo. I was surprised to see Jrue so high on the Iso list. SGA also deserves a mention for his underrated iso ability.

In transition, we see mostly offensive Bigs like Collins, Davis and Capela. Jimmy Butler is the lone guard in the top 10 with below average 3 point shooting. Both Collins and Butler are much more efficient than the rest of the top 10. Players like Bertans, House, Redick, Hayward, Warren, and OG have high 3 point shooting and can release quickly during the transition.

In the Pick and Roll, the best ball handlers are the usual suspects of Dame, CP3, Kemba, and Luka, but there are some interesting players too. Marcus Morris is the only PF that runs the P&R as the ball handler with high efficiency. The Celtics have 3 players (including Marcus Smart) in the top percentages so they're doing something right with their P&R plays. Jeff Teague somehow is in the top 10 but that may be due to running with KAT during his tenure on the Wolves. Christian Wood has shown his improvement, especially in scoring this year as the most efficient roll man in the league.

While posting up as a traditional center has all but diminished in the NBA, there are still a few fantastic players in this regard. Only four players guarantee a point on an average post-up play: Embiid, Jokic, DeRozan, and Gallo. As expected, Embiid and Jokic dominate the post-up game, each with a high frequency of this play style and high efficiency. DeRozan shocks me as the 3rd most efficient post-up player, especially since he is by far the smallest guy on this list.

Spot-up shooting is not as dominated by stars as the other lists as it is mainly a part of the game relegated to role players. Still, Khris ""Almost 50-40-90"" Middleton reigns supreme in this play style. The only other star in this top 10 list is KAT. The Mavs have two top 5 spot up shooters in THJ and Seth Curry, much owing to Luka's fantastic playmaking.

Other things I find interesting: 

-	The 2 possession per game threshold limited many players who did not use a play style as their primary or secondary method of offense. This eliminates the variance caused by low number of data points.

-	DeRozan is in the top 10 for Post Ups, Pick and Roll Ball handling, and Isolation. He is the prototypical 90s player in the modern league.

-	Giannis doesn't appear in the top 10 for any play style, which definitely surprised me.

1544,549,David West is trying to launch the Historical Basketball League as an alternative to the NCAA; ‘We need to create something fair.’,"Full Article from WSJ is here: https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-this-former-nba-champion-wants-to-pay-college-basketball-players-11551120224.     
Here's the main points from the article however.      
- Recently became chief operating officer of a nascent outfit called the Historical Basketball League, which is recruiting top high school players for a summer season that would begin in 2020.      
- The league would give player salaries ranging from $50,000 to $150,000 and a full college scholarship.     
>The players would forgo NCAA basketball and instead join one of 12 inaugural teams—cities will be chosen from an initial pool of 20, depending on where the league can attract investors. They would be able to choose a nearby college or vocational school, provided they are offered admission on their own academic merits.    
    
   
-League still hasn't found a media partner to buy distribution rights to its games. They think that do so, they're gonna need at a few top 15 HS players in the country to commit to them.     
- Andy Schwarz (the co-founder) said the league needs $30 million to $40 million to ensure that it can launch in 2020 and be able to offer the guaranteed salaries.   
- The league's founders are Schwarz (an antitrust economist who's been involved in multiple lawsuits against the NCAA, including the Ed O'Bannon case) and Ricky Volante (a Cleveland attorney).     
- West became interested in this topic in 2010, after reading about the suspensions imposed by the NCAA on Ohio State football players for trading their own athletic gear and memorabilia for tattoos. (“That’s when I got sort of annoyed to the point where I would support something that created a better opportunity, I just found those punishments ridiculous.”)         
- ""By holding the season during the summer, West said players can be fully engaged as students in programs that suit them. By contrast, he said, NCAA players are typically isolated from the larger student body because of the travel and practice demands of their sport. Though he thrived at Xavier, he didn’t have much time to get to know the students who could one day be his business partners.""     
- The league will hold require the players to be in academic good-standing.    
- ""West said it can better prepare aspiring NBA and overseas professionals with a style of play that more closely resembles the pro game. It will include NBA court dimensions and aim for a faster pace of play than is common at the NCAA level""       
- Even if the HBL fails, West said, it could still be successful by pressuring the NCAA to better compensate football and basketball players.

1546,551,How much would Darren Collison move the needle for either of the LA teams?,"The Paul George trade may have been the most earth-shattering news of the off-season, but my money for the most WTF news of the off-season was Darren Collison retiring (honorable mention to Mirotic leaving the NBA as well).

I'm a Pacer's fan and I like Collison a lot. Prior to his retirement news I had him pegged to go to the Lakers anyways to ring-chase. He's exactly the type of point guard they were looking for in the first place; a killer three point shooter who can bring some secondary playmaking to the table. He may have cost himself a strong contract by not going into free agency last off-season (although I think he can get some of that back during this coming free agency class) but that doesn't mean his chance at a ring is gone.

That all being said, I don't watch a lot of Clippers games and I can't say how he'd fit on that team. I imagine he'd have a more fleshed out role with the Lakers. Either way, his ties to both Vogel and Doc Rivers don't have me surprised that those are the two teams he's interested in.",nbadiscussion
1547,552,8th seed in the Western Conference,"The Western conference is amazing this year. There are 7 teams that I think would feel like their season is a huge disappointment if they don't make the second round. The Lakers, Clippers, Rockets, Warriors, Nuggets, Jazz, Blazers. Only 4 of these teams can make the second round which means at least 3 of them will have disappointing seasons. I don't think It makes sense to try and predict which teams will make the second round now because that will depend on who they match up against in the first round. So my question is who do you think will take the last playoff spot in the West.

1. Spurs
2. Pelicans
3. Timberwolves
4. Mavs
5. Kings
6. Thunder
7. Suns
8. Grizzlies

That is my order from most likely to least likely to  make the 8th seed.

I put the Spurs first mostly because they made it last year and the year before that and the year before that....

Pelicans I can see being a bottom 3 team in the west but their potential is really high. So many young players but they all can play. Also their defense at guard is so good I could even see them putting up a good fight if they somehow manage to play Portland in the first round.

Towns is the best player not on those other 7 teams but I think its likely that they are fighting for the 8th spot and don't get it AGAIN...

Mavs have Porzingis and Luca. other then that they are a bit limited Hardaway can score and Powell is solid but overall the team is not so good in my opinion. Also if Porzingis stands at the three point line all day like he did in New York then they only have 1 star player in Luca.

I expect some people to get mad at me for putting the Kings so low. I just think they over preformed to star last season. I don't expect that to happen again. We know Fox and Hield are good but I'm not sure either are all-stars next year. Will Bagley take a big step in his second season? They would need everything to go right to make the Playoffs.

The last 3 teams I don't really think have much of a chance. Even if Paul stays healthy this is a team that seems to be in tanking mode after trading away their 2 best players in the off season.

The Suns were trash last year. Booker and Ayton can play but they can't seem to win. Adding Rubio will not be enough to make a playoff push

Grizzlies no comment needed.

1548,553,Strongest Playoff Runs (relative to competition) [1974-2019],"[A couple of weeks ago I made a post attempting to measure the relative strength of championship teams using their playoff BPM.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/c451cg/relative_champion_strength_as_determined_by/)  As pointed out by u/Hathalot, it didn't necessarily capture the underlying strength of those teams, merely the 'impressiveness' of their run, hence the new title.

However, it was the [following feedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/c451cg/relative_champion_strength_as_determined_by/ervg8wj/) from u/LordDickRichard that inspired me to explore further:

> a healthy golden state might have won the title so without examination of runners up of past years there is reallly no saying weither or not the raptors are ""worthy"" champions since it seems possible the champions weren't always the highest ranked in pte. 

At first I thought this would be too much work - after all, why stop at runners-up? A conference finalist could easily have a higher ranking, and so on and so forth. But I discovered a quick workaround, and lo and behold, here's every playoff team since 1974:

1549,554,What if Gregg Popovich never coached the Spurs?,"I was watching some old full game playoff highlights on YouTube, and watched the Spurs vs Rockets in 1995. With all the mythology of how Hakeem totally dominated Robinson and the Spurs I was actually how shocked how close the series was in a couple of games.

In Game 1, with 30 seconds left and leading by a point, Doc Rivers stripped Hakeem and Sean Elliott is fouled with the chance to make it a 3 point game. However he steps up and bricks both free throws.

On the next possession with the shot clock winding down, Robert Horry hits a huge two pointer to take the lead for Houston. The Spurs come out of their time out and Elliott drives but his floater comes up short on the final possession.

If any of those go the other way, with the way the series panned out the Spurs could’ve taken a 3-1 lead into a home game 5. If they lose that and Robinson melts down in the final minutes of Game 6, they’d still have had a Game 7 in San Antonio to fall back on.

Say they manage to win that and get past the Magic and Shaq in the finals who Rodman traditionally defended well against, does history still play out the same?

Popovich was only the GM in those days so my question is would he have still fired Bob Hill after their awful start in 1996/97 when they ended up tanking for Duncan? It seems a big move firing a coach just over a year out from winning a franchise their first ever title. Was Popovich coaching the Spurs always inevitable? Fun little what if.",nbadiscussion

1551,556,Comparing Giannis and Draymond's 3 best defensive seasons,"I know, it's a very random comparison. I just got bored and I wanted to see how Giannis stacked up against arguably the best defensive player of his generation. I also researched this mainly to highlight just how great Giannis is defensively.

For these numbers, I just added all of the made and missed shot totals by shot type from their 3 best seasons, calculated the percentage of the totals, then divided these totals by how many games they played in that 3-season span to gauge how many shots they both contested per game.

I didn't pick their overall 3 peak defensive seasons, I merely picked the 3 best seasons they both strung together consecutively.

1553,558,[OC] Shot chart of shots made on assist by Lebron James,"LeBron James is leading the NBA in assists by a big margin, and beacuse of that I decided to take a look at where are shots made on assist by LeBron.

Here is the [chart](https://i.imgur.com/1eVP3GP.png).

""Catch And Shoot"" shots are those which were shot directly after the pass by LeBron. Usually, those are jump shots, dunks and layups.

""Created"" shots are ones that required a few extra dribbles after James passed the ball to the player who scored the basket. Such shots came from drives or post shots mostly. 

Just a note, this is a pretty much rough estimation, as there is no specific categorization of assists such as this but there is a type of each shot, so I tried to take a look at some videos of some actions to ""conclude"" which is true catch and shoot, and which isn't.

1554,559,Luka Doncic's Historic Season Inside The Arc,"Luka is having an impressive season overall with a 29 point near triple-double averages. Mirroring Westbrook's MVP season but with way better efficiency and worse defense. But arguably even crazier is just how good he has been inside the arc.

As of 21/11/2019 or 14 games in, he is shooting 61.3% on 10.7 attempts inside the arc. To put this into context, he is 8th on 2pt% for players with at least 10 attempts in the last 10 seasons. He is 1st for Guards. All-time he is 17th overall and still 1st for Guards. This is when compared to All-time greats such as Magic Johnson.

Diving even further he is shooting 73% on shots 0-3 feet from the rim, 50.7% on 3-10ft, 56.3% on 10-16 ft, and 75% on 16-3pt. His impressive percentage in long 2s is mainly down to his low attempts there so it should not be taken too seriously. However his percentages in the rim are something else, 22% of his shot comes from the rim and his percentage there is centre-like. 

A big part of why he is so effective on the rim is his improvements in the athletic department. He is very strong for a guard and his amazing touch from his strong floater game seems to have translated to layups. I see him outmuscling his man while in the air and following it up with a sweet touch on the layup. His passing threat also sort of gives him a ""negative spacing""  near the rim where help defence would not commit fully to him, worrying about his throw to the corner. Making his euro step even deadlier.

Idk if 14 games are enough of a sample size, but this definitely look promising.",nbadiscussion

> - The owners chose to make contracts shorter in the past few collective bargaining agreements. That was meant to protect teams from bad deals and protect players from getting stuck being underpaid. But the change has helped transfer power to star players because of their ability to change teams more easily, and they can now pressure teams because of it. This is no small admission.
> 
> - While the league has touted its massive global social media following for a decade, the focus of the discourse might have changed in a way that has hurt the league.
> ""At some point it does matter what they're saying, in terms of our brand, our values and what we stand for,"" Silver said. ""It's fine if it's speculation -- where is LeBron [James] going to go. People can talk about it and have all sorts of theories. It's not good when a player who is in the middle of a contract's agent shows up in a city he doesn't live and announces this player doesn't want to be here. That's bad for the fans there. It puts the league in a difficult position because it's an entertainment product.""
> 
> - This got plenty of attention, but he said it strikes him that many players are truly unhappy, despite the massive amount of money now in the game and its popularity. He was amazed at how isolated some star players are.
> 
> - He said All-Star Game changes were like ""putting an earring on the pig"" and indicated that long-term he might want to scrap All-Star Weekend to make room on the schedule for a midseason tournament.
> 
> 
> - Silver said that market size imbalances are worrying him in a new way -- not as in the past, when players were limited in off-court opportunities if they played in small markets and therefore wanted to play only in big hubs. But now with the clustering of stars on teams -- even small-market teams -- the costs are creating cases in which teams might have to choose between keeping a contender together and franchise profitability.
> ""That's an unfair position to put our teams in,"" he said. ""Are you willing to be a deep taxpayer and lose money in order to compete? That's a fault in our current system."" 
> This is a big change from long-standing tradition, starting with David Stern, of the league saying a small market team could both compete and make money if it were well run -- if, say, you had Sam Presti as your general manager and not David Kahn. That's a hard sell these days, as Presti's Oklahoma City Thunder have one of the league's highest payrolls in one of its smallest markets so they could keep Paul George and Russell Westbrook. It's a path the Milwaukee Bucks could soon be headed down to keep their strong team alongside Giannis Antetokounmpo.
> 
> - TV ratings for games are down this season. The All-Star Game ratings were down. Silver said the league is struggling to reach the millions of fans from the target age 18-34 demographic who don't have cable or streaming packages. They care about the league but don't build the habit of watching games on TV or in person, a core tenet of creating revenue. ""You see a tweet saying, 'Warriors-Rockets great matchup, Harden is going for 60.' The fact [is] you can't just [click] and get that game,"" Silver said.

&#x200B;

If all players can't get injured and were healthy during playoffs, regardless when they had their injuries, who would've won the most?   


I think LeBron could've won 5 straight, '12, '13, '14(Dwade was having knee issues; still up for grabs as spurs were goddamn great), '15, '16. He would've lost 07, 11, 17, 18 since his teams here were just plainly outplayed. GSW could've won 3 straight, '17, '18, '19; respect to Raps but KD and Klay and Cousins battling injuries is a huge factor.   


Other teams I think could've won more: Boston when KG got injured, Spurs when Kawhi got injured, Chicago when Rose went down(but the Heat were tough to beat).  I was a bit young this year, but I think any TMac team would win more as well? Also, Clippers! Cp3 Clippers is one of the greatest what-ifs of this decade

1559,564,Bam Adebayo MIP?,"The first two years I liked Bam Adebayo, but I didn't even entertain the idea of him being more than an athletic rim roller and defender. The way he's playing now is so crucial to Miami's success. The common narrative is that he's the Draymond Green of his team, but I feel like that undermines his athleticism. This guy can RUN. His playmaking ability is also superb, and he is almost always the ""pivot"" player on this team, and his AST% is third highest after Jimmy Butler (and Goran Dragic, who is the key playmaker of the second unit), who naturally brings the ball up the court and the ball still ends up in his hands on most fastbreaks.

Defensively, he's versatile enough to defend under the rim and around, taking up defensive duties similar to Chris Bosh during his Miami Days. The areas where he's improved are enough to make him my pick form Most Improved. Even with Jimmy Butler coming in, he has been able to increase his skillset, even with his usage right still being under 20%, showing his efficiency with the ball in his hands.

The other candidate I've heard a lot of buzz for is Devonte' Graham, but he's a sophomore who had very limited ball handling with Kemba last year. Another player is Siakam, but to me this is more about us seeing more of what he can do as the star of the team with Kawhi gone. I really don't see the NBA giving him a repeat.",nbadiscussion
1560,565,How to fix load management and parity in the NBA in one fell swoop,"Get rid of max contracts and institute a punitive hard cap. The players would still get all of the same money because it's written into the collective bargaining agreement that they get 50 some percent of NBA revenues.

Doing this would spread out the stars and also reward teams that compete with depth and fit.

Load management goes away because star heavy teams cannot afford to lose every game he sits due to the increased parity. It would also mean tighter playoff races as the playing field would be more level.

And finally, it would end this current system where the NBA small markets are effectively a farm system for the Lakers.

Arguably 2 of the top 5 players (when healthy) in the league, as well as an additional 3 within the top 25, changed teams.

This year's class? Not as highly regarded as last year. Anthony Davis is the crown jewel, while Brandon Ingram is the best restricted free agent available. The hype of this class was further deflated when players like [Kyle Lowry](https://www.nba.com/article/2019/10/07/report-kyle-lowry-contract-extension) and [Draymond Green](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27314349/green-warriors-reach-4-year-100m-extension) signed extensions with their current teams.

What I wanted to do was predict what contracts this year's free agent class might get based off previous offseasons. Stars generally get star-type money, but in tiers below, contracts of comparable players usually come up in discussing contract value.

# Dataset

* statistical data (regular season totals and cumulative advanced stats) from Basketball-Reference
   * I do understand that some players get paid on the strength of playoff performance
* [historical free agents](https://www.basketball-reference.com/friv/free_agents.cgi?year=2019) (2016-2019) and [salary cap history](https://www.basketball-reference.com/contracts/salary-cap-history.html) also from Basketball-Reference
* 2020 free agents from [Spotrac](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/free-agents/)
* historical contract info from [Capology](https://www.capology.com), [Spotrac](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/contracts/) and [Basketball-Insiders](http://www.basketballinsiders.com/nba-team-salaries-at-a-glance/)
   * Capology = main source, but inconsistent with min/near-min contracts
   * Spotrac requires a premium login to view contract cap hits beyond the last and current contracts, but the cash earnings are free to view
   * When player was near-minimum & played for multiple teams in one season, Basketball-Insiders had transaction history in team salary archives (needed player's first team of season)
   * set contract years to zero and salary to zero for players who went overseas, had explicitly non guaranteed first years in their contracts (training camp deals, two ways, ten days, exhibit 10s) or had blanks in their contract terms cell
   * included option years and partially guaranteed years in my calculation of contract years (looked at it as both player and team intending to see out the contract)

# Preprocessing the Data

I started off with contract year stats, because there's anecdotal evidence that players exert more effort in their contract year. **I initially wanted to use totals to bake in availability/body fragility, but the shortened season would cause the model to declare all players to be fragile and underestimate their contract**. Stats other than games played, games started, and the advanced stats (OWS, DWS and VORP) were converted to per game. Percentages were left alone. Games played, games started, and the advanced stats were scaled to have a normal distribution (mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1).

In addition to using contract year stats, I summed the past two years and the contract year. Why did I settled on 3 years?

* Players do get paid on past performance, so just using contract year stats was out of the question
* 2 years opens up the possibility of a fluke year
   * Kawhi would have his nine game season bring down his averages significantly from his Raptors season: adding another year somewhat lessens this effect
* On the other hand, it's **quite unlikely that teams factor in stats from more than 4 years ago**, a lot would have changed (the Knicks didn't pay Derrick Rose to recapture his form of his MVP year)

Another reason I settled on 3 years is that I can keep the same model for restricted free agents:

* my thought is that the rookie year is a bonus: great if you did well, but doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things if you did poorly
* For example, if Donovan Mitchell had a worse rookie year but had the same level of play that he has achieved in his second and third year (as well as next year), **I highly doubt that Utah would offer Mitchell a significantly less amount of money due to a substandard rookie year**

I performed the same processing on the three-year totals, using the three-year game total as the denominator for converting to per game. I had to calculate the three-year percentages, and also re-engineered the win shares per 48 minutes metric.

* removed categories that were linear combinations of one another (total rebounds = offensive + defensive rebounds)
* kept age and experience as predictor variables, but removed position because I felt it would ultimately reflect in the stats

# Data Visualization

[Relationship between targets (first year salary as % of cap and contract years)](https://i.imgur.com/a8ZOpqT.png)

* box and whisker with transparent layer of actual points (added random variation to see all points)
* correlation coefficient is 0.77 (strongly and positively correlated)
* median value of first year cap % (middle line in each box) increases w/increase in contract length

[Relationship between win shares as first year salary as % of cap](https://i.imgur.com/IhyTCBS.png)

* shouldn't be too groundbreaking: better players get paid more

[Distribution of contract length by offseason](https://i.imgur.com/pX4piAY.png)

* no surprise that as contract length increases, the percent of contracts of that length given out decreases
* in 2016, the amount of players who didn't receive contracts was lower than the amount who received 1, 2, or 4 year contracts
   * 2016 was the year the salary cap spiked from $70 million to $94 million
   * Similar to a lot of people with new-found money, teams spent somewhat recklessly.

# Dealing w/Target Correlation

As mentioned, the target variables are correlated with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.77. My method to combat this:

* predict one target first without the other as a predictor
* choose the best model (be that a single model or an ensemble of multiple models)
* use the first target's predictions as an input to predict the second target

So I will have a model that predicts years first and salary second, as well as a model that predicts salary first and years second. **I know it's not the greatest method (correlation does not imply causation!), and I'm open to hear alternative ways y'all would have gone about it!**

One potential problem is compounding errors. If there's an incorrect year prediction, it might lead to an incorrect salary prediction and vice versa.

# Algorithms to Train

* a linear regression model as a baseline
* a k-nearest neighbors model: take the distance between the statistics of two players (the absolute value of the difference) and then take the average of the outcome variable of the k nearest neighbours

A very simple example:

|Player|PPG|RPG|Contract|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|A|25|7|4 yrs, $90 million|
|B|24|8|?|
|C|6|0.3|1 yr, $2 million|
|D|5|0.5|?|

With a 1 nearest neighbour model, you can clearly see that B is most similar to A, and D is most similar to C. Therefore, B's predicted contract is 4 years and $90 million, and D's predicted contract is 1 year and $2 million.

* a decision tree model: maybe as a player passes certain statistical thresholds, their contract increases?
   * only using for predicting the contract years; since there are so many different salary percentages, a solitary decision tree would either be useless or far too complicated
* two random forest models: better than decision trees in that they reduce instability by averaging multiple trees
   * unfortunately, the cost is we don't get an easily interpretable tree
* a support vector machine: attempts to separate classes with a hyperplane
   * support vectors are the points closest to the hyperplane, named as such because the hyperplane would change if those points were removed
   * Here's an [image from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine#/media/File:Svm_separating_hyperplanes_(SVG).svg) that I believe succinctly explains SVMs

# Testing the Models

## Years First, Salary Second

[years performance metrics](https://i.imgur.com/BP7lIYb.png)

* Mean absolute error is the measure of the average difference between forecasts, while the residual mean squared error penalizes large errors
* The random forests provide by far the best performance, being above 80% accuracy when no other model is above 60%. However, they have a hard time distinguishing max contract year players.
   * This is somewhat understandable, as the fifth year is only accessible to players resigning with their current team.
   * The models could get confused seeing similar players in stats, but one signed for five years and one signed for four.

To alleviate this, I propose that if a player is predicted by ANY model to be a 5 year player, their contract year prediction is 5. Else, use a median of Rborist, ranger and SVM.

Why am I including SVM? Well, it has the best performance among the other models. I’m assuming that the random forest models will generally agree with each other. In the off chance they don’t, I’ll rely on the SVM to break the tie.

[years decision tree](https://i.imgur.com/1NAbvMg.png)

The decision tree maximizes its prediction when a player does all of the following:

* has above average offensive win shares in the contract year
* plays more than 28 minutes per game in the contract year
* shoots better than 41% from the field in the contract year
* has less than 9 years of experience

The decision tree minimizes its prediction when a player does all of the following:

* has below average offensive win shares in the contract year
* has at most slightly above average defensive win shares in the contract year
* steals the ball less than 0.56 times per game in the contract year
* is an unrestricted free agent
* has played almost half a standard deviation less games than the average in the last 3 years

[salary performance metrics](https://i.imgur.com/tYbZnjW.png)

* With the MAEs being relatively similar, I’ll take the median of the models.

## Salary First, Years Second

[salary performance metrics](https://i.imgur.com/vStmI9s.png)

* The MAE range for the salary-first model is much smaller than the equivalent for the salary second model.
* I’ll take the median, as I did for the previous.

[years performance metrics](https://i.imgur.com/L0qIAvS.png)

* All models achieved at least the same if not a better correct prediction percentage than when predicting years first.
* The number of max year predictions has substantially increased (and in the linear model’s case, has outstripped the actual number of max contracts given out).
* I’ll take the median of all models except KNN, which has the lowest prediction accuracy by around 8%

[years decision tree](https://i.imgur.com/I1oz8CM.png)

* The singular decision tree again has trouble with predicting max contract length.
* Salary makes up 50% (4 of 8) of the decisions in the tree.
* The decision tree minimizes its prediction when a player has a predicted salary of less than 0.76% of the salary cap.
* The decision tree maximizes its prediction when a player is less than 31 years old and their predicted salary is above 16% of the cap.

# Evaluating the Models

[Here's a google sheet of all predictions separated by whether a player had a player option or not](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TwHkJGUj2BEX8YHUF_Gx7Ii_jD9-zyN-Ww5eO1WM3pY/edit?usp=sharing)!

* Totals are based on a $115 million salary cap (might not happen, but is a concrete number we have at our disposal) and 5% annual raises

## Selected Player Option Decisions

I was unsure how to deal with club options, but players who decline player options become unrestricted free agents.

|player|Y1S2 Cap %|yrs\_Y1S2|total\_Y1S2|S1Y2 Cap %|yrs\_S1Y2|total\_S1Y2|2021 Option|

|Otto Porter|0.08297334043|2|19.56|0.07925015245|2|18.68|28.49|
|DeMar DeRozan|0.2781873551|3|100.85|0.2657556943|3|96.35|27.74|
|Nicolas Batum|0.01857416549|1|2.14|0.02604507845|1|3|27.13|

|Jerami Grant|0.132122261|3|47.9|0.1139293428|3|41.3|9.35|
|Stanley Johnson|0.01658695123|1|1.91|0|0|0|3.8|

While some might be surprised at the DeRozan and Drummond projections, we have to note that the model doesn't take into account intangibles like playing reputation, team fit, or willingness to take a reduced salary to be on a championship contender.

**If Anthony Davis re-signs with the Lakers, he is eligible for eight percent raises rather than five. That would bring the Y1S2 total to $202 million, which is exactly what he is eligible for.** In terms of the three year projection, Davis could sign that shorter contract with the last year being an option in order to be eligible for the 35% max contract after 10 years of service (but the model wouldn't know that).

Jerami Grant and surprisingly (to me at least) Evan Fournier look like players set to cash in after declining their option. Players like Nicolas Batum, James Johnson, Otto Porter and Stanley Johnson (who's predicted to be out of the league by the S1Y2 model) would be wise to accept their option.

## Selected Free Agents

|player|Y1S2 Cap %|yrs\_Y1S2|total\_Y1S2|S1Y2 Cap %|yrs\_S1Y2|total\_S1Y2|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Brandon Ingram|0.2548324081|4|126.31|0.2465662829|4|122.21|
|Danilo Gallinari|0.2173187706|3|78.79|0.2149018106|3|77.91|
|Fred VanVleet|0.1961214299|4|97.21|0.1888455092|4|93.6|
|Montrezl Harrell|0.19201499|3|69.61|0.1782262995|4|88.34|
|Hassan Whiteside|0.1941521099|3|70.39|0.1723290935|3|62.48|

Assuming **Brandon Ingram** (a first-time All-Star this season) doesn't make one of the three All-NBA teams, his first year contract salary is capped at 25%, which is right in line with predictions. However, I (among many others) expect Ingram to get the full five year extension.

The Heat wanted to acquire **Danilo Gallinari** from the Thunder this trade deadline, but ultimately were unable to broker a deal. Gallinari's career has been marred by injuries, but he has played over 80% of games the past two seasons. He's averaging 19 points per game this year, on 44% field goal shooting and 40% three-point shooting.

After his breakout in last year's Eastern Conference Finals and NBA Finals, **Fred VanVleet** has blossomed again in a starting role this season. Even so, Masai Ujiri and Bobby Webster might balk at paying him $24-25 million per year.

**Montrezl Harrell and Hassan Whiteside** are the first cases of dissension between the two models. The S1Y2 model projects Harrell to get 4 years, while the Y1S2 model only projects three. For Whiteside, the difference is almost 8 million dollars less in salary under S1Y2.

|player|Y1S2 Cap %|yrs\_Y1S2|total\_Y1S2|S1Y2 Cap %|yrs\_S1Y2|total\_S1Y2|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Marcus Morris|0.1675722624|3|60.75|0.1587575186|3|57.56|
|Joe Harris|0.1539417297|3|55.81|0.1586893002|3|57.53|
|Serge Ibaka|0.1536284642|3|55.7|0.1416514857|3|51.35|
|Bogdan Bogdanović|0.1284454435|3|46.57|0.1216267861|3|44.09|
|Jordan Clarkson|0.1357167335|3|49.2|0.1062462145|3|38.52|

**Marcus Morris** reneged on a verbal 2-year, $20 million contract with the Spurs last offseason to sign a 1-year, $20 million deal with the Knicks. He was the focal point of the Knicks offense and a hot commodity at the trade deadline, ultimately ending up with the championship-contending Clippers.

In February, Zach Lowe on his Lowe Post podcast thought that **Joe Harris** had a chance to double his current salary of $8 million. The models are even more optimistic, projecting his first year salary as over $17 million.

**Bogdan Bogdanovic** has been mentioned as the second-best RFA in the class. He might be squeezed out of Sacramento, considering the recent contracts to Buddy Hield and Harrison Barnes as well as upcoming contracts to De'Aaron Fox and Marvin Bagley III.

**Jordan Clarkson** has the largest discrepancy in salary ($11 million) between the two models.

|player|Y1S2 Cap %|yrs\_Y1S2|total\_Y1S2|S1Y2 Cap %|yrs\_S1Y2|total\_S1Y2|

|Derrick Favors|0.09816080257|2|23.14|0.1064310171|3|38.59|

**Davis Bertans** has shot the lights out this season, earning himself a raise over his current salary of $7 million.

**Christian Wood** has flashed star-like potential since being inserted into the starting lineup in place of the departed Andre Drummond. But the key here is *12 games started*. Wood played limited minutes in the first four months of the season. His contract situation, as well as that of **Malik Beasley** (who flourished after being traded to Minnesota mid-season), are intriguing to say the least.

# Limitations, Methodology Changes and Future Work

Limitations

* unable to quantify intangibles like playing reputation, team fit, or willingness to take a reduced salary to be on a championship contender
* also can’t determine which team will sign which player
   * highly depends on a sequence of events: if Team A signs this player, they don't have enough money to resign Player B, who then goes to Team C for less money, etc
* due to the shortened season and the uncertainty of the cap, higher-tier players might take shorter deals to give them more flexibility

Methodology Changes

* maybe I should have predicted them as a tuple instead of sequentially
   * unfortunately, caret doesn't have that capability of multi-target regression
* maybe should have implemented a time factor or weighted recent years more heavily, as team decision makers may have gotten smarter
* wanted the models themselves to perform feature selection and determine what the most important variables were

Future Work

* looking at the contract years as a classification problem with 6 classes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
* try more models, like boosting (in which models are added sequentially, with later models in the sequence attempting to correct the errors of earlier models)
* predicting a third target: whether a contract will end in an option year
   * Star players are more likely to demand the last year of their contract as a player option in order to take ownership of their future.

# TL;DR

* Attempted to use machine learning on NBA free agents from 2016-2019 to predict contract length & first year salary as % of the salary cap for 2020 free agents
* Used contract year stats as well as summed last-three-year stats (converted to per game)
   * games played and cumulative advanced stats (WS & VORP) were scaled due to the shortened season
* since targets were correlated, I predicted one target first and then used its predictions to predict the second target
   * Six models were tested: linear, k-nearest-neighbors, decision tree, two random forest algorithms and a support vector machine
* Anthony Davis is the only player predicted to get a five year deal
   * Davis, Brandon Ingram, DeMar DeRozan, Andre Drummond, Evan Fournier and Fred VanVleet are all projected to get above $ 90 million in total contract value
   * [here's a google sheet with all the predictions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TwHkJGUj2BEX8YHUF_Gx7Ii_jD9-zyN-Ww5eO1WM3pY/edit?usp=sharing)
* Models can't quantify intangibles like playing reputation, team fit, or willingness to take a reduced salary to be on a championship contender; also star players more likely to take shorter deals to maintain flexibility in this uncertain season

1563,568,Hakeem Olajuwon is the GOAT centre,"There have been so many great centres but there is no centre better than Hakeem. Olajuwon's championship runs were some of the best by one player in all of history . Compared to other great centres like Kareem, Shaq and Bill Russell, Olajuwon did not need an absolute super team surrounding him in order to win. It was Hakeem who took over the league when Jordan retired, don't forget that.

Those are just the championships but he's arguably also the best defender of all time and a top 3 post player of all time too. In my opinion, Olajuwon is a top 5 two-way player of all time. He's just that good.

The combination of stats, MVPs, championships and indviual skill should be enough to show that Olajuwon is the best centre of all time.

**thoughts??**
__________________________________

OAKLAND — This Houston Rockets rage was not about one game.

This wasn’t about Game 1 of the Western Conference Semifinals, where they fell 104-100 to the Golden State Warriors and left Oracle Arena utterly convinced yet again the defending champions are getting the benefit of the whistle to a devastating degree.

This wasn’t about emotion — though there was plenty. Mike D’Antoni getting his technical in the third quarter, when he chewed on official Zach Zarba’s left ear like it was a rib-eye and nearly got tossed.

Chris Paul losing his cool in the late third quarter, and again near the end regulation when he was ejected after the latest no-call left him incensed. James Harden, whose poor shooting night (9-of-28) had everything to do with all those times he believed he should’ve been sent to the line, wanting to rip his beard out at all those points in between and saying afterward that he just wanted “a fair chance.”

Rockets general manager in Daryl Morey, whose reputation as a leader of the analytics movement is rooted in his ability to let the evidence guide one’s process, sharing his emotional reaction to it all via Twitter when he retweeted Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban after the game.

Daryl Morey ✔ @dmorey Been working on things since 2006 ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Mark Cuban ✔ @mcuban 2 minute report is going to be very interesting tomorrow. Will tell you so much about the management of the nba officiating group

2,834 3:26 PM - Apr 28, 2019 Twitter Ads info and privacy

747 people are talking about this

No, this was about the NBA’s most analytically minded organization deciding long ago that all the data in this heavy-hitter matchup proves their point: The Warriors, as they see it, are getting the kind of officiating edge that simply must be stopped. And Game 1 – which was refereed by Zarba, Josh Tiven and Courtney Kirkland – confirmed their fears that this playoff battle with the Warriors might be just as painful as the last when it comes to the officiating.

By the Rockets’ internal count from their video crew, there were eight attempted 3-pointers that should have been fouls in Game 1 – good for 24 free throw attempts that would’ve certainly decided the game. There was insult added to injury on that front as well, with D’Antoni and Harden both saying officials told them at halftime they had missed foul calls on four Rockets 3-point attempts.

But make no mistake, this is much bigger than one game.

According to sources with knowledge of the situation, the Rockets have been making a data-driven case with the NBA for quite some time that these Super Team Warriors are getting a major officiating advantage in these heavy-hitter matchups. And of all the specific examples that have been discussed with league officials, none has left them more suspect of the system than the 2018 Western Conference Finals. This series opener, more than anything, was salt being poured directly into that Rockets wound.

When that series ended nearly a year ago, the Rockets’ research had just begun. They secured the play-by-play officiating reports from each game from the NBA – a service that is afforded to individual teams (teams aren’t given reports for other teams, which makes it hard to compare). These reports document the league’s verdict on correct calls and missed calls in the same way as the Last Two Minute reports that are shared publicly, with the obvious difference being that it accounts for all 48 minutes of action.

And after the Rockets went through every line, tallying all the missed calls for each team and adding up the potential points that were lost along the way, it wasn’t pretty: The Rockets, according to the sources, had a double-digit point deficit in six of the seven games (and a small edge in Game 2). In all, sources say, they were harmed to the tune of 93 points. Game 7 was the worst, the research showed, with the league-issued report indicating they should have had 18 more points. More specifically, two of the 27 consecutive missed 3-pointers that did them in were ruled to have been missed foul calls.

What’s more, the same “landing space” play that had the Rockets furious after Game 1 was a major point of frustration during that series – especially after their Game 7 loss, and with D’Antoni as upset as anyone over the matter. As detailed in this “NBA Video Rulebook” breakdown, defenders are required to allow shooters to “safely return to the floor.”

The vertical jump shots are the easiest to officiate, but the rule also applies to plays in which the shooter’s momentum carries him to a spot that’s different from where the jump originated. The historical backdrop of this debate wasn’t lost on Rockets officials, either: In September 2017, the NBA instituted a rule that allowed officials to call a flagrant or technical if the defender “recklessly positioned his foot in an unnatural way” under the shooter; the rule was inspired by then-Golden State center Zaza Pachulia’s placement of his foot under Kawhi Leonard during the 2017 Western Conference Finals, when the then-San Antonio star had his season ended by that ankle injury.

“Call the game how it’s supposed to be called and that’s it,” Harden said. “And I’ll live with the results. … We all know what happened a few years back with Kawhi. That can change the entire series. Just call the game the way it’s supposed to be called and we’ll live with the results. It’s plain and simple.”

To that end, the Rockets also believe another one of their allegations was confirmed yet again in Game 1: The notion that the league’s more experienced officials are far less willing to call this play in accordance with the rules, as compared to younger officials. Sources say the Rockets raised this research-inspired complaint with the NBA months ago, and it didn’t help matters in their eyes that this game fell right in line with that theory (Zarba is in his 16th season, Tiven is in his ninth, and Kirkland is in his 19th).

When Morey sent that tweet, which will likely lead to his latest fine, the “2006” mention sparked an obvious flashback: Cuban’s Mavericks lost to Miami in the 2006 Finals, which remains among the most controversial in the league’s history when it comes to the officiating. But there was another key event that year as well, as Morey left the Boston Celtics to join the Rockets as an assistant general manager in April 2006 en route to building this team he wants so badly to end this Warriors run and win the franchise’s first title since 1995.

If they don’t get the calls they believe they deserve this time around, though, this debate will likely rage on into yet another disappointing finish.",nbadiscussion

I know Seattle is an obvious choice. I know Vancouver failed before, but this is a different time. I dont think Mexico City would work travel wise. Im really curious what anyone else thinks and if they believe we could have another couple teams in the NBA.",nbadiscussion

Who’s available and where should they go?,"An interesting topic was brought up by a new YouTube channel that’s putting out daily content (A.M. Hoops): Top players available to sign for Orlando?

“The NBA is figuring out an insurance plan in case players get sick while inside the Disney World playoff bubble. One idea is to let teams sign players before the season resumes. 

Eligible players must have been on an NBA or G-League roster at some point this year - even just at training camp. That eliminates a lot of big names but still includes some potential contributors. 

With this rule we could see DeMarcus Cousins return, Gerald Green return, Tyler Johnson return, Vince Carter return and Vince Carter farewell plus an Iman Shumpert return. 

Fans would like to see a Jeremy Lin return, Jamal Crawford return, JR Smith return, Lance Stephenson return or a Darren Collison return but all those players would not be allowed to sign with a new team having not been on an active roster for the 2019/20 season.”

1568,573,Did the NBA really have a coke problem?,"Hey guys, first post so hopefully I'm not being that guy, searched and didn't find the type of discussion I was interested in.  I just reignited my love for NBA basketball after years of forgetting that life can be fun sober, and have been trying to absorb all the information and stories I can about the league's history, specifically the Bird era and right before.  I had read an interview and heard numerous stories about the coke and crack problem the NBA had in the late 70's and 80's, and I guess have been wondering how much of this is true, and how much is made pushed by the owners?  Taking the cultural frame into context, I can't help but think of the reports and investigations into how the 70's and the 80's with the Reagan administration used agencies like the CIA to work social manipulation and social programs such as DARE and other tactics  such as flat out moving crack into neigborhoods and spreading all sorts of misinformation.  Taking this into account, and the fact that owners are often directly or indirectly involved in politics and other social norms of that world, was the coke and crack problem as bad as the reports?  Or were owners and players being told they need to encourage those ideas and spreading them for political and financial gain?  This may be, and prolly is, just me asking dumb questions, but it did give me pause and has me wondering if anyone has heard or know of anything going on other than celebrities liking uppers?

1569,574,[OC] Most Dominate Title Teams of All Time (Statistical Analysis),"[(original post)](https://basketblogga.blogspot.com/2019/06/most-dominate-nba-title-teams-all-time.html)

**Intro**

*(Skip to the section titled* ***Top 40 Ranks*** *if you just want to see my list of title teams without explanation)*

I wanted to objectively rank all 73 NBA title teams in order of their dominance on the league for their year. I consulted four team stats evenly:

* Regular Season Win Percentage
* Playoff Win Percentage
* Regular Season Point Differential
* Playoff Point Differential

I chose these statistics because I believe they are objectively linked with the meaning of ""dominance"".

I compared these stats for each title team to the averages of all the title teams. The following rankings are bases solely off of these relative statistical standings.

**Possible Biases**

* *Parity & Quality Opponent Scrutiny* \- Teams who played in competitive leagues and faced tougher playoff opponents are short-changed here.
* *Changes in Season Length and Playoff Brackets* \- The length of regular season schedules and format of playoff brackets have changed several times since 1947. I suspect shorter seasons and playoffs are statistically favored.
* *The Data I Chose to Observe and the Choice to Weigh them Evenly* \- Some might consider the regular season or playoffs more important. Some might consider playoff loses less relevant. Some might not care about point differential. Some might care about a stat I did not observe.

**Top 40 Ranks**

40. 2005 San Antonio Spurs

39. 2012 Miami Heat

38. 1980 Los Angeles Lakers

37. 2000 Los Angeles Lakers

36. 1981 Boston Celtics

35. 2002 Los Angeles Lakers

34. 1960 Boston Celtics

33. 1990 Detroit Pistons

32. 1982 Los Angeles Lakers

31. 1959 Boston Celtics

30. 1993 Chicago Bulls

29. 2007 San Antonio Spurs

28. 2016 Cleveland Cavaliers

24. 2013 Miami Heat

23. 2009 Los Angeles Lakers

22. 2018 Golden State Warriors

21. 1964 Boston Celtics

**20. 2014 San Antonio Spurs**

* Regular Season Record (%): 62-20 (*0.756*)
* Playoff Record (%): 16-7 (*0.696*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *7.8*
* Playoff Point Differential: *9.3*

\-San Antonio's most recent title outranks any LeBron run and is the highest showing for Tony Parker, Ginobili & Kawhi. They took more playoff losses than some but are above-average in every other statistical category.

\-

**19. 1949 Minneapolis Lakers**

* Regular Season Record (%): 44-16 (*0.733*)
* Playoff Record (%): 8-2 (*0.800*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *7.3*
* Playoff Point Differential: *7.4*

\-Time for some Mikan love. The season and playoff bracket may have been short but these champs clocked in solid win percentages and differentials overall.

\-

*--Tier 3 - Above Average Dominance--*

\-

**18. 1992 Chicago Bulls**

* Regular Season Record (%): 67-15 (*0.817*)
* Playoff Record (%): 15-7 (*0.682*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *10.4*
* Playoff Point Differential: *6.2*

\-Chicago's fourth highest ranking title team had an impressive regular season but face more difficulties in the playoffs.

\-

**17. 1961 Boston Celtics**

* Regular Season Record (%): 57-22 (*0.722*)
* Playoff Record (%): 8-2 (*0.800*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *5.6*
* Playoff Point Differential: *11.6*

\-Russell's top rank and Boston's second highest title season lands here for inverse reasons of the previous team: a relatively bland regular season with an impressive playoff run.

\-

**16. 1989 Detroit Pistons**

* Regular Season Record (%): 63-19 (*0.768*)
* Playoff Record (%): 15-2 (*0.882*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *5.8*
* Playoff Point Differential: *7.7*

\-While each category is solid, Isiah's first championship nearly hits the top 15 mainly because of their impressive playoff record (which includes 3 sweeps).

\-

**15. 1985 Los Angeles Lakers**

* Regular Season Record (%): 62-20 (*0.756*)
* Playoff Record (%): 15-4 (*0.789*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *7.3*
* Playoff Point Differential: *10.1*

\-While this is Magic Johnson's second highest ranking championship team, this is Kareem's third. Oddly, while this team lost more games in both the regular season and the playoffs, these Lakers had better differentials than the '89 Pistons (ranked 16th).

\-

**14. 1999 San Antonio Spurs**

* Regular Season Record (%): 37-13 (*0.740*)
* Playoff Record (%): 15-2 (*0.882*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *8.1*
* Playoff Point Differential: *7.2*

\-The first title for David Robinson, Popovich & Tim Duncan may get overlooked because of the shortened regular season but they won at a high rate with strong margins. The highest ranking Spurs swept a young Kobe/Shaq squad and only caught two total playoff losses.

\-

**13. 2001 Los Angeles Lakers**

* Regular Season Record (%): 56-26 (*0.683*)
* Playoff Record (%): 15-1 (*0.938*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *3.4*
* Playoff Point Differential: *12.8*

\-Speaking of the devils, here we have the highest ranking appearance of Kobe or Shaq specifically because of their playoff run (which is arguably the second best of all time). Despite the relatively mediocre regular season, losing one playoff game and winning them by more than a dozen apiece is true dominance.

\-

**12. 1950 Minneapolis Lakers**

* Regular Season Record (%): 51-17 (*0.750*)
* Playoff Record (%): 11-2 (*0.846*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *8.4*
* Playoff Point Differential: *9.1*

\-Another Mikan surprise. The season and playoffs were more compact so that might be skewing the data but this title team won a consistently strong amount of games with strong margins. Our final kudos to the original beast of the NBA.

\-

**11. 1972 Los Angeles Lakers**

* Regular Season Record (%): 69-13 (*0.841*)
* Playoff Record (%): 12-3 (*0.800*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *12.3*
* Playoff Point Differential: *3.2*

\-Here's a stacked team: Riley, Goodrich, West and Chamberlain. Unfortunately, they only had Elgin Baylor for nine regular season games. The only category dragging these champs down is their unusually low playoff point differential which is a result of their [series against the Milwaukee Bucks where the Lakers won despite a negative point differential](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/1972-nba-western-conference-finals-bucks-vs-lakers.html).

\-

**10. 2015 Golden State Warriors**

* Regular Season Record (%): 67-15 (*0.817*)
* Playoff Record (%): 16-5 (*0.762*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *10.1*
* Playoff Point Differential: *7.8*

\-Perhaps the most controversial ranking here, Curry's first title is top ten mainly because of their dominant regular season. Winning over eighty percent by more than ten a game is significant enough to elevate the original Splash Brothers here.

\-

**9. 1997 Chicago Bulls**

* Regular Season Record (%): 69-13 (*0.841*)
* Playoff Record (%): 15-4 (*0.789*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *10.8*
* Playoff Point Differential: *5.5*

\-This edition of Jordan's Bulls has a similar resume as the previous team listed: an elite regular season with a checkered playoff run. The slightly more impressive regular season is the edge here.

\-

**8. 1967 Philadelphia 76ers**

* Regular Season Record (%): 68-13 (*0.840*)
* Playoff Record (%): 11-4 (*0.733*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *9.4*
* Playoff Point Differential: *9.4*

\-Possibly to the chagrin of Celtic fans, Wilt's only victory over Russell is the highest ranking title team for either player because of the dominant regular season and good differentials. Other contributors to this team where Hal Greer, Chet Walker, and Billy Cunningham.

\-

**7. 1983 Philadelphia 76ers**

* Regular Season Record (%): 65-17 (*0.793*)
* Playoff Record (%): 12-1 (*0.923*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *7.7*
* Playoff Point Differential: *6.5*

\-Here we have our Moses Malone and Julius Erving moment. This championship team has strong numbers but what really stands out is the 12-1 playoff run. All-time, there are only three title teams to take a single loss in the playoffs.

\-

*--Tier 2 - Elite Dominance--*

\-

**6. 1991 Chicago Bulls**

* Regular Season Record (%): 61-21 (*0.744*)
* Playoff Record (%): 15-2 (*0.882*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *9.0*
* Playoff Point Differential: *11.7*

\-The top choice of Jordan's first trilogy, 1991's campaign sticks out for its elite playoff run. Beating Ewing, Barkley, Isiah Thomas and Magic Johnson in four consecutive series is amazing. Taking only two loses along the way with a margin of nearly a dozen points per game is iconic.

\-

**5. 1986 Boston Celtics**

* Regular Season Record (%): 67-15 (*0.817*)
* Playoff Record (%): 15-3 (*0.833*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *9.4*
* Playoff Point Differential: *10.3*

\-Larry Bird & Co.'s highest ranking title team starts off the top five because of a very strong regular season and playoff run. With names like Carlisle, Ainge, Walton, Parish, and McHale on the roster, it is no wonder this team was so statistically consistent.

\-

**4. 1987 Los Angeles Lakers**

* Regular Season Record (%): 65-17 (*0.793*)
* Playoff Record (%): 15-3 (*0.833*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *9.3*
* Playoff Point Differential: *11.4*

\-The height of Showtime, it really is remarkable just how similar these numbers are to the 1986 Celtics. Trading two less regular season wins for a point more in the playoff win differential is the statistical edge apparently (but the margin is razor thin). Either way, shout out to Scott, Worthy, Riley, and, of course, Magic and Kareem.

\-

*--Tier 1 - Outlier Dominance--*

\-

**3. 1996 Chicago Bulls**

* Regular Season Record (%): 72-10 (*0.878*)
* Playoff Record (%): 15-3 (*0.833*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *12.3*
* Playoff Point Differential: *10.6*

\-Likely the biggest shock of these rankings is seeing peak Jordan ranked only third. The greatest regular season of all title teams is surprisingly outdone here because their playoff run was slightly less dominant.

\-

**2. 1971 Milwaukee Bucks**

* Regular Season Record (%): 66-16 (*0.805*)
* Playoff Record (%): 12-2 (*0.857*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *12.2*
* Playoff Point Differential: *14.5*

\-Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's first title run and the only championship for Oscar Robertson & Milwaukee is special for having the best playoff point differential here. All the other stats are quite impressive as well so, while it may be an obscure choice, the 1971 Milwaukee Bucks have a strong claim to the most dominant season ever.

\-

**1. 2017 Golden State Warriors**

* Regular Season Record (%): 67-15 (*0.817*)
* Playoff Record (%): 16-1 (*0.941*)
* Regular Season Point Differential: *11.6*
* Playoff Point Differential: *13.5*

\-Millennials rejoice, the first Curry/Durant Warriors' title run tops my statistical dominance rankings because they paired an elite regular season with the greatest playoff run of all time. Sporting the best playoff record and second best point differential ever ultimately trumps this list.

1571,576,How would the perception of Larry Bird's career change (if at all) he retired in 1986?,"According to a few different sources, with this video of him discussing it as one of them; https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqvUeJnDtOQ

It looks like there might have been a possibility of retiring not in 1986, but 1988.

I would like to consider how the general perception of his career might have change (if at all) if he retired after the 1986 season. I've chosen 1986 because from 1989 onwards he was injured a lot and at the tail end of his career - I'm not sure it would be that interesting of a conversation.

By the end of the 1986 season Larry Bird had played seven NBA seasons.

He had won three championships

Three regular season MVPs 

Two finals MVPs

I've seen a number of people say that he was being discussed as potentially being the Goat by around 1986. Now this conversation might have dissapeared only five seasons later with Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan having further MVP and championship winning seasons, but by 1986 he had already achieved all of the MVPs and championships he would attain in his career.

Would Larry Bird be considered a top ten player today if he had retired after just seven seasons in the league? 

If he had this sort of a career, do you think people would be more likely to rate Magic Johnson higher than Larry on the all time list?

There's something quite amazing about the first few years of his NBA career; he had so much success. Who else in their first seven seasons achieved this much? Only Bill Russell had 3 MVPs and 3 championships during the same period of time. Others like Duncan 
, MJ and Kareem had similar strong starts, but without the same accomplishments.",nbadiscussion

The NBA is gonna have to renegotiate a TV/media deal in a few years, and most of their massive salary cap and contracts is based off the pre-cord cutter massive 2014 TV deal. When this discussion begins, how is the NBA going to be able to convince any networks to give them a similar huge deal when ratings are cratering this season just based on the location some players choose/are drafted to play in and when fans are openly saying they don't actually want to or care about watching full games and take pride in their zoomer fanbase who are all cord cutters, and no network is gonna put NBA games regularly on FOX/NBC/CBS/ABC over the air channels? 

And even if the NBA beefed up League Pass or a streaming service bid on the rights, again, if fans care more to watch highlight videos over actual full games, there's no way in hell services are gonna pay big bucks for stuff fans don't even watch. Holy hell the NBA is gong to get absolutely massacred in the new TV deal. That salary cap is going to plummet and so will player salaries. It's gonna be crazy.",nbadiscussion
1573,578,How good was Dwight Howard's playoff run with Houston in 2014?,"To me, Dwight Howard was fresh off a disastrous one-year tenure with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2012-13 after a near-decade run with the Orlando Magic from 2004-05 to 2011-12. He finally reached unrestricted free agency in 2013 and decided to try and play outside of Kobe Bryant's shadow in L.A., and joined up with the Houston Rockets on a four year $87.5M contract to join forces with James Harden to be a formidable duo.

It was in his first year with the Rockets that Dwight averaged 18.3 points, 12.2 rebounds and 1.8 blocks in 33-34 minutes played, and started all 71 games at center as a massive upgrade on Omer Asik, and earned his one last NBA All-Star appearance for the Rockets.

But in the 1st round of the 2014 NBA Playoffs vs the Portland Trail Blazers (led by Damian Lillard and LaMarcus Aldridge), Dwight Howard turned back the clock to his Orlando Magic heyday as far as his stat averages for the 2014 playoffs went up to 26 points per game, 13.7 rebounds per game and 2.8 blocks per game in 38 minutes per game proved it, and was the league leader in TRB per game and BLK per game for the playoffs.

Even if it happened against Robin Lopez (Portland's starting center), I think Dwight had a monster playoff run that year. Since 2014, Dwight ended up mostly playing secondary star for the rest of his Rockets tenure as he was limited to 41 games in 2014-15 to a Torn MCL/Meniscus so they had to rely on Donatas Motiejunas and Joey Dorsey to fill in for him as the interm starting center.

And when he was healthy in 2015-16, Dwight was reduced to 13.7 points, 11.8 rebounds and 1.6 blocks in 32 minutes as James Harden was clearly the undisputed go-to-guy for the Rockets, and the Rockets needed Clint Capela (who was the starter at PF in Dwight's last season with Houston) to be their main center, and so after his contract with the Rockets expired, Dwight Howard went back to free agency where the 2016 free agent class was the mother of all free agent class bonanzas, and capitalized on the bonanza by joining his hometown Atlanta Hawks on a three-year, $70.5M contract in 2016 but has bounced around the league even more since then with Atlanta, Charlotte, Brooklyn (never played due to buyout), Washington, Memphis (never played due to buyout) and is now heading back to the Lakers as a role player and an insurance backup behind JaVale McGee after former Golden State Warriors player DeMarcus Cousins tore up his ACL.

What are your thoughts on Dwight Howard's 2014 playoff run before a Torn MCL/Meniscus ended his prime for good? Did you think he actually turned back the clock to his Orlando Magic heyday vs. the Portland Trail Blazers in Round 1, or did he only do that because he was matching up against Robin Lopez?",nbadiscussion
1574,579,Can we have a rational Curry discussion?,"He started the regular season very hot but cooled down after a short injury and is all but guaranteed 1st team All NBA

In the playoffs he started with probably a top 5 performance so far 38/15/7 on something like 95 TS and had a great game 2 first half. After that he’s fallen to pieces, taken 5 less shots per game than in the RS, been consistently in foul trouble (although it’s affected his minutes) and had a couple nagging injuries including that awkward looking dislocation.

This all culminates in last nights horror:

- 17pts 7/23 shooting 5 tov
- 0 pts on 0/6 shooting in 4th/OT
- blew two vital wide open layups in quick succession
- 1/3 FT shooting

Oddly enough it’s the FT shooting that makes me worry the most, any player can have cold games but the statistically best FT shooter ever doesn’t miss 2 FTA in a row (0.8% but having a cold game rarely effects FT shooting so it aligning with his arguably worst ever playoff performance is not a good sign)

What do we really think is up with Curry? Struggling with physicality? Mentally checked out? Injured? Deferring to durant? Out of rhythm/cautious due to foul trouble? Just a cold game? Lack of opportunity in plays run? worn down on the defensive end by the rockets?",nbadiscussion

In this format a team like Portland coming strong in playoffs get better chance of facing 4th seed and making 2nd round and gives 1st and 2nd seed to ease into playoffs facing a easier matchup for their team.",nbadiscussion
1576,581,Idea to fix late season tanking: Lock lottery odds after 60 games,"**The Problem**

As we approach the end of the season a common theme I'm hearing from analysts and reporters is ""Team X should be losing games at this point.  They can't make the playoffs and can greatly improve their draft pick.""  And they're absolutely right.  Teams with no shot at the playoffs have a perverse incentive structure where wins hurt them and losses help them.

.

**The Idea**

So what if the lottery odds and draft order locked after, say, 60 games? The final 22 games would still affect who makes the playoffs and seeding, they just wouldn't have any impact on the draft. It doesn't have to be 60 games, but should be late enough in the season that we know who the good teams and the bad teams are, while still being early enough that fringe playoff team have a legit shot at making it.

.

**The Benefits**

* This would make it much more difficult for teams to punt on the season partway through.  By the time mid level teams know they aren't making the playoffs it would already be too late to shut players down and try to improve their lottery odds.
* Without the incentive to lose games late in the season, front offices would put out the best team possible for the slim chance of making the playoffs, build winning culture, and put the best product on the court for fans.
* Even teams that were tanking the entire season would be incentivized to try to win as many games as they can in the home stretch.

.

**The Downsides**

* This wouldn't stop teams from coming into the season with the goal of getting a top 5 pick.  Even though these teams might be more competitive late in the season, they would still want to lose as much as possible early.
* A team could make the playoffs and get a lottery pick.  This doesn't seem like too big of an issue to me.  If a mid level team is in the lottery at the 60 game mark and manages to go on a run late in the season, why not reward them with a low playoff seed and low lottery odds?
* A team could miss the playoffs and the lottery.  Alternatively a team that is in the playoffs at the 60 game mark and falls out would neither have a playoff seed nor a lottery pick.  In practice this would likely mean the team's pick only being a few slots lower than it would have been: something like pick 13 to pick 15, so this doesn't seem too big of an issue.

.

So what do you think reddit?  While not perfect it seems like this system would solve one of the significant tanking issues in the NBA and improve quality of play at the end of the season.

1579,584,What current players will become good coaches?,"Lots of former players go on to become coaches but there's not a ton of correlation between between success on the court and the sidelines. There are some, like Doc Rivers and Larry Bird, who did both well. However there are plenty of examples, Isiah Thomas and Jason Kidd, of great players who failed as coaches. And there are mediocre players, Pat Riley and George Karl, who went on to become excellent coaches.

1582,587,[OC] Explaining Giannis’ left knee mild capsular tear and return to play (RTP) timeline," [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yih4Bvhw20I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yih4Bvhw20I)

Hey everyone - in this med analysis, I explained Giannis’ left knee mild capsular tear, when to expect him back on the court, and if there are any risks moving forward. Thanks to the mods for letting me post.

Here’s a table of contents:

\- 0:00 Intro

\- 0:17 The injury

\- 1:45 Return to play (RTP) timeline

For those at work or the hard of hearing, I've transcribed subtitles on YouTube so sound isn't required.

Summary: Giannis suffered a ""mild capsular tear"" of his left knee vs the Lakers and is set to be re-evaluated after the Bucks current road trip. The capsule is a dual-layer connective tissue that surrounds the knee joint with the outer aspect providing stability and the inner providing synovial fluid to the joint. Typically, capsule tears are associated with other injuries, especially on the lateral aspect of the knee, referred to as posterolateral corner injuries. However, based on the diagnosis and Coach Bud's comments about ""best case prognosis"", this sounds like an isolated capsule tear and should keep Giannis out for a limited time. For example, Rudy Gay had the same injury and only missed one game. Based on the Bucks schedule, the Warriors game on 3/14 could be a good target. The one variable is if they get extremely conservative considering their lead in the ECF and title aspirations.

For reference, I’m a DPT with sports rehab & performance clinics in West LA and Valencia, CA. Feel free to hit me with questions or you can always find me on IG and twitter @ 3cbperformance.",nbadiscussion
1583,588,Wildcard Pre-Playoff games for 7-10 seeds would make the rest of the NBA season more interesting,"At the halfway mark of the NBA season, the top 6-7 teams in each conference are pretty clear. After the top 6 in the East, there is a considerable drop off. The same would be true in the west if not for OKC's recent run. For the ""Wish they were on the playoff bubble"" teams like the Suns, Kings, Bulls, Pelicans, the season is effectively over. These teams all have about 5% or less chance of making the playoffs.

Having baseball/football-type wild card games before the playoffs would make the second half of the season much more interesting for the aforementioned teams, plus pretty much every other bottom dwelling team (except hopeless teams like Golden State & Atlanta).

Under the wild card system, the match-ups would be:

1. Orlando Magic (7) vs. Chicago Bulls (10)
2. Brooklyn Nets (8) vs. Charlotte Hornets (9)
3. OKC Thunder (7) vs. Portland Trailblazers (10)
4. Memphis Grizzlies (8) vs.  San Antonio Spurs (9)

These match-ups are not super interesting, but the wild card system allows for potentially very interesting games. Things to consider:

* Zion is coming back and this makes the second half of the season much more interesting for him and the Pelicans. Also a Ja vs. Zion wild card game would be amazing.
* KAT and Wiggins are having good years and it would be nice to incentivize them to finish out the season strong and not tank. This is true for many other teams too.
* This makes the regular season more important for teams like teams like Toronto/Indiana/Philly who would really hate to slide down to 7th and have to play a wild card game. 
* Phoenix Suns fans really need something to cheer for.",nbadiscussion
1584,589,Is Devin Booker really better than Zach LaVine?,"I'll admit it, I am a little biased. I am a huge Zach LaVine fan. I am a Timberwolves fan, and became a fan of his when he was on the Wolves. I was pissed the night when we traded Jimmy Butler, as I felt we gave up way too much, and that we were actually the ones robbed, not the ones doing the robbing, because Butler's age and where he was at in his career didn't fit our timeline with Towns and Wiggins (who looked extremely promising at the time), and that LaVine, Dunn, and whoever we drafted with the 7th pick (probably Lauri) fit our timeline and roster much better. I had little to no worry about Zach recovering from his ACL tear. His first year back, yes he looked a little rough and struggled with efficiency, but that was to be expected. And then this year came, and he was a monster. 24, 5, and 4, on extremely efficient 47/37/83 shooting splits, and got to the line 6 times a game, which was a career high for him.

Now, here is my question. Ever since Devin Booker got into the league, he has been heralded as ""the next Kobe"" and the next big thing. But the main argument against Zach is that his game has yet to yield winning basketball, but here's the thing: the exact same thing can be said for Booker. In my opinion, if LaVine is putting up ""empty stats"" than so is Booker. I'll admit, Booker is a better playmaker, but Zach is a better athlete. Here's what concerns me: Booker is heralded as the better shooter and all that. But this year, he shot 47% (basically same as LaVine) and shot 86% from the free throw line on 7 attempts per game, so about right in line with Zach. From 3, he shot 33% on 6.5 attempts per game. LaVine again shot 37%, and on a high number of attempts as well, 5.1 per game. And you can say Booker didn't have talent around him, same can be said for LaVine. Booker had Ayton all year. LaVine went through most of the first half with no Lauri, and no Dunn, and Jabari Parker was probably the next best player next to him, and he didn't get Otto Porter until the trade deadline. They are both bad defenders I should note as well, though I give LaVine a slightly better chance to improve on that end. In my opinion, they are about equal players right now, both having a few strengths and weaknesses separate from each other. So why does Booker always get looked at as the ""franchise cornerstone"" and better player than Zach LaVine, who is a young stud and building block in his own right. Let me know your thoughts below!

Edit: Thanks y'all for the great discussion on my first post. I think I got down to the bottom of how I feel, and it's that rather than focusing on who's better, we should focus on how Booker may be better than LaVine, it is a much closer gap than most would admit, and LaVine has many strengths that Booker doesn't, being a better second or tertiary option and better defense and more room for impact on that end. Great discussion; no one attacked each other, we all just focused on the basketball argument at hand.",nbadiscussion
1585,590,30 NBA All-Time Teams in 30 Days: All-Time Charlotte Hornets (13/30),"Note: I know I didn't post the first 12 writeups over here at r/nbadiscussion, but somebody recommended for me to post it here as well as r/nba and each NBA team's subreddit

Anyways, welcome to today's edition of the NBA All-Time teams with the All-Time Charlotte Hornets. The same criteria is the same as always; 2-4 players at each position and the players and coaches on each all-time team are based on their tenure with said team. For the Hornets and Pelicans (whose All-Time team is coming out tomorrow), the Hornets have all of Charlotte and the Pelicans got all of New Orleans. Anyways, onto the squad!

**Head Coach: Paul Silas (1999-02, 2010-12)**

Accolades w/Team: 193-208 Regular Season Record, 11-12 Playoff Record

**Assistant Coach: Allan Bristow (1991-96)**

Accolades w/Team: 207-203 Regular Season Record, 5-8 Playoff Record

Accolades w/Team: 196-214 Regular Season Record, 3-8 Playoff Record

&#x200B;

**PG1: Kemba Walker (2011-19)**

Accolades w/Team: 3x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 19.8 PPG, 3.8 RPG, 5.5 APG, 1.3 SPG, 0.4 BPG

After leading UConn to a national championship and winning the Most Outstanding Player in the Final Four in the 2011 NCAA Tournament, Kemba Walker was drafted ninth overall by the then-Charlotte Bobcats in the 2011 NBA Draft. Walker improved his statistics, for the most part, in each of his first five seasons in Charlotte from 12.1 PPG in his rookie season to 20.9 PPG in his fifth season. However, Walker became an All-Star for the first time during the 2016-17 season as he averaged 23.2 PPG, 3.9 RPG, and 5.5 APG. After Walker had another All-Star season in the 2017-18 season with averages of 22.1 PPG, Kardiac Kemba had his best season last year as he averaged 25.6 PPG, 4.4 RPG, and 5.9 APG and had his first All-NBA selection as well. However, the Hornets missed the playoffs in the last three seasons, and Walker left Charlotte as their all-time leading scorer to join the Boston Celtics in free agency a month ago.

&#x200B;

**PG2: Baron Davis (1999-02)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star

Stats: 12.6 PPG, 3.7 RPG, 6.5 APG, 1.8 SPG, 0.4 BPG

Drafted third overall in the 1999 NBA Draft by the Hornets, Baron Davis spent the first three years of his NBA career in the Queen City. Davis went from averaging 5.9 PPG on 19.6 MPG as a rookie to averaging 13.8 PPG, 5 RPG, 7.3 APG, and 2.1 SPG in his second season with the team. B-Diddy had an All-Star campaign in his third season with the Hornets as he averaged 18.1 PPG, 4.3 RPG, 8.5 APG, and 2.1 SPG. His postseason performance in 2002 was even better than his regular season as he averaged 22.6 PPG, 7 RPG, 7.9 APG, and 3.6 SPG despite shooting a below-average 37.8% from the field. However, the Hornets left Charlotte in 2002 for New Orleans, and Baron Davis went with them to the Big Easy, the first of three players on this all-time team that relocated with the first Hornets franchise to New Orleans.

&#x200B;

**PG3: Muggsy Bogues (1988-97)**

Stats: 8.8 PPG, 2.9 RPG, 8.8 APG, 1.7 SPG

An extremely undersized point guard at 5’3”, Muggsy Bogues had a very solid nine-year tenure with the Hornets. After drafted in the expansion draft, Bogues had an okay first year with the team, averaging just 5.4 PPG and 7.8 APG. However, Bogues improved and remained a consistent point guard from 1989 to [this moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_6wunmLn5M) with the future owner of the Hornets in the 1995 postseason as he averaged 9.5 PPG, 3.2 RPG, 9.3 APG, and 1.8 SPG including two seasons where he averaged at least 10 APG during that span. Bogues was never the same player after 1995 and was traded to the Warriors at the start of the 1997-98 season.

&#x200B;

**SG1: Eddie Jones (1999-00)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team, 2x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 19.2 PPG, 4.5 RPG, 4.2 APG, 2.8 SPG, 0.8 BPG

Eddie Jones was a two-time All-Star with the Lakers when he was acquired by the Hornets during the 1999 lockout season. In 30 games with the Hornets in 1999, Jones averaged 17 PPG, 3.9 RPG, 4.2 APG, and 3 SPG. Although the Hornets went 19-11 in the 30 games that Jones played in, the Hornets were unable to make the playoffs even though he made the All-Defensive 2nd Team. Jones had an even better 1999-00 season with the team as he averaged 20.1 PPG, 4.8 RPG, 4.2 APG, and a league-leading 2.7 SPG, made the All-Star team and All-NBA 3rd Team, and helped the Hornets return to the playoffs. The Hornets lost in the first round of the playoffs and Jones went to Miami during the 2000 off-season.

&#x200B;

**SG2: Dell Curry (1988-98)**

Accolades w/Team: 1993-94 Sixth Man of the Year

Stats: 14 PPG, 2.9 RPG, 2 APG, 1.1 SPG, 0.3 BPG

I know Dell Curry did much more for the Hornets than Eddie Jones did but I had to make Dell come off the bench considering he started in only 77 out of the franchise-leading 701 games he played for the franchise. After being drafted in the expansion draft by the Hornets in 1988, Curry had an okay first season, averaging 11.9 PPG but he had a much better year in his second season with the team as he averaged 16 PPG. He had a down season the year after that but he remained consistent during the next six seasons as he averaged 15.5 PPG, 3.5 RPG, and 2.3 APG over that span. After averaging 9.4 PPG in the final season with the Hornets, he signed with the Bucks before the 1998-99 season. Dell is still involved in the NBA after his retirement as he works as a color commentator with the Hornets and has two sons in the NBA, including two-time MVP and the greatest three-point shooter of all-time in Stephen Curry.

&#x200B;

**SG3: Kendall Gill (1990-93, 1995-96)**

Stats: 15.6 PPG, 4.5 RPG, 4.2 APG, 1.5 SPG, 0.5 BPG

Drafted fifth overall in the 1990 NBA Draft, Kendall Gill was a solid player for the three-and-a-half seasons he played for the Hornets. After averaging 11 PPG in his rookie campaign, Gill had a really good sophomore season where he averaged 20.5 PPG, 5.1 RPG, 4.2 APG, and 1.9 SPG. Gill dropped a bit in his third season, and he was traded to the Supersonics before the 1993-94 season. He returned to the Hornets at the start of the 1995-96 season where he averaged 12.9 PPG, 5.3 RPG, and 6.3 APG in 36 games before being traded to the Nets in a deal that sent Kenny Anderson to Charlotte.

&#x200B;

**SF1: Glen Rice (1995-98)**

Accolades w/Team: 3x All-Star, 1997 All-Star Game MVP, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 23.5 PPG, 4.4 RPG, 2.4 APG, 1 SPG, 0.3 BPG

The Hornets acquired sharpshooter Glen Rice in the 1995 off-season after they had to trade Alonzo Mourning because of his beef with fellow star Larry Johnson. After making the All-Star team for the first time in the 1995-96 season when he averaged 21.6 PPG, Rice had a huge 1996-97 season as he averaged 26.8 PPG, 4 RPG, 2 APG, won All-Star Game MVP, made the All-NBA 2nd Team, and even led the league in three-point percentage at 47% on 5.6 attempts per game. He had another All-Star campaign in the 1997-98 season when he averaged 22.3 PPG, but he missed the beginning of the following season, and he was traded to the Lakers during the middle of next season for a package that included Eddie Jones.

&#x200B;

**SF2: Gerald Wallace (2004-11)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star, 1x All-Defensive 1st Team

Stats: 16.4 PPG, 7.5 RPG, 2.4 APG, 1.8 SPG, 1.2 BPG

Although Gerald Wallace averaged only 3.4 PPG on 9.7 MPG in his three seasons in Sacramento, the then-expansion Charlotte Bobcats took the chance on him and picked him up in the expansion draft in 2004. After averaging 11.1 PPG in his first season in the Queen City, Wallace improved even more in his second season with the team as he averaged 15.2 PPG, 7.5 RPG, and a league-leading 2.5 SPG. Even though the Bobcats were losing, Wallace was still pretty good as he averaged 18 PPG, 7 RPG, 2.9 APG, and 1.9 SPG over the next three seasons. However, Wallace had a huge season in the 2009-10 season with averages of 18.2 PPG, 10 RPG, and 1.5 SPG, made the All-Star team as well as the All-Defensive 1st Team and even helped the Bobcats reach the playoffs for the first time. Unfortunately, the Bobcats returned to their losing ways the very next season, and he was traded in the middle of that season to the Portland Trail Blazers.

&#x200B;

**SF3: Jamal Mashburn (2000-02)**

Stats: 20.6 PPG, 7.1 RPG, 5 APG, 1.1 SPG, 0.2 BPG

When the Hornets traded Eddie Jones in a sign-and-trade deal to the Miami Heat in 2000, they got three-point shooter and scorer Jamal Mashburn in return. Although he only played in a season and a half in Charlotte, Mashburn was still very good, especially in his first season when he averaged 20.1 PPG, 7.6 RPG, and 5.4 APG and helped the Hornets reach the playoffs. Mashburn played even better in that 2001 postseason as he averaged 24.9 PPG, 6.2 RPG, and 5.7 APG in 10 postseason games. While Mashburn averaged 21.5 PPG, 6.1 RPG, and 4.3 APG the following year, he got injured and only played in 40 games which made him play only ten minutes in the 2002 postseason. After that season, the Hornets moved to New Orleans, and Mashburn joined the team in the Crescent City for the 2002-03 season.

&#x200B;

**PF1: Larry Johnson (1991-96)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star, 1991-92 Rookie of the Year, 1x All-NBA 2nd TeamStats: 19.6 PPG, 9.2 RPG, 4.1 APG, 0.8 SPG, 0.4 BPG

When Larry Johnson was drafted first overall in the 1991 NBA Draft, he was expected to be the next big superstar. Although he fell short of those expectations, he is still one of, if not the greatest player in Hornets history. He had an exceptional rookie season where he averaged 19.2 PPG, 11 RPG, and 3.6 APG which helped him win the Rookie of the Year award. Johnson followed that rookie campaign with an even better sophomore campaign as he averaged 22.1 PPG, 10.5 RPG, and 4.3 APG, made the All-Star team as well as the All-NBA 2nd Team and even helped the Hornets reach the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. “Grandmama” was so good that the Hornets paid him $85 million over 12 years during the 1993 off-season after just two seasons with the team. However, Johnson suffered a back injury that derailed his athleticism, and he played just 51 games in his third season with averages of 16.4 PPG, 8.8 RPG, and 3.6 APG. While Johnson did play in 162 out of 164 possible games over the next two seasons and averaged 19.7 PPG, 7.8 RPG, and 4.5 APG during that span, he was not the same after that back injury, and he was traded to the Knicks during the 1996 off-season for the backup power forward on this all-time team.

&#x200B;

**PF2: Anthony Mason (1996-00)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-NBA 3rd Team, 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 13.4 PPG, 10 RPG, 4.8 APG, 0.9 SPG, 0.3 BPG

Anthony Mason was acquired by the Hornets in the deal that sent Larry Johnson to the Knicks, and he turned out to be a solid player in his three years in the Queen City. Mase averaged 16.2 PPG, 11.4 RPG, and 5.7 APG, which earned him a spot on the All-NBA 3rd Team, All-Defensive 2nd Team, and helped the Hornets reach the playoffs with a 13-win improvement from last season. Although Mason was not as productive in his final two seasons in Charlotte as he was in his first, he still averaged 12.2 PPG and 9.4 RPG and helped them make the playoffs both times. However, he was traded to the Heat in the 2000 offseason despite his production with the Hornets.

&#x200B;

**PF3: Elden Campbell (1999-02)**

Stats: 13.5 PPG, 7.7 RPG, 1.5 APG, 0.8 SPG, 1.8 BPG

Acquired by the Hornets from the Lakers during the 1999 season, Elden Campbell was a solid big man during his three-and-a-half-year stay in Charlotte. After averaging 15.3 PPG and 9.4 RPG during the 32 games he played during his first half-season in the Queen City, Campbell continued to be a solid role player for the Hornets during the early 2000s as he averaged 13.2 PPG, 7.4 RPG, 1.4 APG, and 1.8 BPG. Campbell, like Davis and Mashburn, were on the roster when the Hornets moved to New Orleans during the 2002 offseason, although Campbell’s numbers fell drastically in the Crescent City.

&#x200B;

**C1: Alonzo Mourning (1992-95)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star

Stats: 21.3 PPG, 10.1 RPG, 1.3 APG, 0.5 SPG, 3.2 BPG

Although the Hornets fell short in the 1992 NBA Draft Lottery for the bragging rights to Shaq, they still made a really good selection with the second pick of that year’s draft with Georgetown star Alonzo Mourning. Mourning had an exceptional rookie year where he averaged 21 PPG, 10.3 RPG, and 3.5 BPG, helped the Hornets reach the playoffs for the first time, and even helped them reach the second round of the postseason as he hit the series-clinching shot in Game 4 of the first round against the Celtics. During the next two seasons, Mourning made the All-Star team in both seasons and averaged 21.4 PPG, 10 RPG, and 3 BPG. However, Mourning rejected a contract extension from the Hornets after his third season which caused the team to send him to Miami in a deal that sent Glen Rice to Charlotte.

&#x200B;

**C2: Al Jefferson (2013-16)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 17.5 PPG, 8.9 RPG, 1.8 APG, 0.8 SPG, 1.1 BPG

Al Jefferson was the biggest free-agent acquisition in the short history of the Charlotte Bobcats. His first season in the Queen City turned out to be a big one for Big Al as he averaged 21.8 PPG, 10.8 RPG, and 2.1 APG which got him on the All-NBA 3rd Team as well as the Bobcats in the playoffs for the second time in franchise history. After his first season in Charlotte, the team rebranded to become the Hornets. However, Jefferson struggled with injuries during the next two seasons as he missed 52 games and averaged 14.7 PPG and 7.6 RPG during that span. After the 2015-16, Jefferson signed with the Pacers but didn’t do much over there.

&#x200B;

**C3: Emeka Okafor (2004-09)**

Accolades w/Team: 2004-05 Rookie of the Year

Stats: 14 PPG, 10.7 RPG, 0.9 APG, 0.8 SPG, 1.9 BPG

As the second selection of the 2004 NBA Draft as well as the first NBA Draft selection in Charlotte Bobcats history, Emeka Okafor was a solid player during his five-year stay in the Queen City. He won the Rookie of the Year in his season in Charlotte as he averaged 15.1 PPG and 10.9 RPG despite the Bobcats’ abysmal record. Okafor continued to average a double-double in each of the next four seasons as he averaged 13.7 PPG and 10.6 RPG during that span. However, the Bobcats continued their losing ways, and Okafor was traded to New Orleans during the 2009 offseason for Tyson Chandler.

**TL;DR All-Time Hornets Roster**

||Starters|Reserves|
|:-|:-|:-|
|PG|**Kemba Walker**|Baron Davis, Muggsy Bogues|
|SG|**Eddie Jones**|Dell Curry, Kendall Gill|
|SF|**Glen Rice**|*Gerald Wallace*, Jamal Mashburn|
|PF|**Larry Johnson**|Anthony Mason, Elden Campbell|
|C|**Alonzo Mourning**|Al Jefferson, Emeka Okafor|
||*Head Coach*|*Assistant Coaches*|
|Coaching Staff|Paul Silas|Allan Bristow, Steve Clifford|

**Analysis**

* Although the Hornets might be one of the worst all-time teams, this team is still really good. Offensively, Kemba, Eddie Jones, Rice, Johnson, and Mourning all scored at least 20 PPG during their best season with the Hornets. There's lots of spacing on this team as Walker, Jones, Rice, and Johnson (in the latter two years of his Hornets tenure) could all shoot threes. Defensively, it's not the best but Jones was a steal machine (2.8) and Mourning was a block machine (3.2 BPG) with the Hornets.
* The bench is okay but it's solid all-around. B-Diddy was a very good scorer and playmaker, Jefferson was very good in the post, Dell Curry could shoot three-pointers off the bench. Defensively, Wallace and Mason were really good as both made an All-Defensive team in Charlotte.

1586,591,Miami Heat vs Los Angeles Lakers Finals Preview Discussion Thread,"I mostly wanted to post this because surprisingly no one else has and I want to see everyone's thought going into the finals.

&#x200B;

The Lakers are the favorite and most would agree that they should be, so let's start with them.

&#x200B;

First thing I want to see is how does Miami keep the Lakers out of transition? The answer to this to me may decide the whole series. Miami so far in these playoffs are a middle of the pack team in terms of limiting transition opportunities which isn't terrible but teams do extremely well against Miami when transition opportunities pop up, Miami is giving up the 3rd highest PPP in transition amongst playoff teams. We all know about the Lakers league leading transition offense, but more importantly if Miami has transition issues this makes what I believe their two defensive strategies that much harder to employ. Miami's Zone or Miami's packing the paint defense that we saw them use against Giannis.

&#x200B;

Bam vs AD, I am so excited to see this matchup. With that said I like Bam as a help defender for this Heat team more and if he is guarding AD, Lebron and others may get a lot of quality opportunities at the rim. But can you really feel good if you're Spo if you throw Jae Crowder out there on AD, not really.

&#x200B;

Lebron, I think Lebron's effectiveness in terms of scoring will completely depend on if/when the Lakers can get Miami out of their zone so Lebron can go mismatch hunting and Miami is going to have plenty of places for him to go in Olynyk, Herro, Robinson, Nunn, and Dragic. I believe we will see a lot of assist from Lebron in this series, in their regular season matchups which first off I wouldn't look into these too much since both rosters are different but if you want to take away anything from those matchups its how the Lakers decided to attack the Heat Zone, a lot of lobs from the high post with the Lakers bigs which Miami hasn't had to worry about from any of their other playoff matchups.

&#x200B;

Last thing on the Lakers which is huge since Miami is the best 3 point shooting team in the league in terms of %. The Lakers throughout these playoffs have done a good job at minimizing their opponents 3 point attempts by 4-5 attempts compared to their regular season numbers in every playoff series so far and I do believe this trend will continue which is huge versus Miami.

&#x200B;

Miami

&#x200B;

I'll be honest I have Lakers in 6 for two reasons, Miami is a team that takes a game at minimum to adjust to and the Lakers in every series have had a sub 29% three point shooting performance which no surprise those are their 3 losses in these playoffs. 

&#x200B;

The Heat are the only team the Lakers will face all playoffs that will make them move off ball, almost every defensive adjustment the Lakers have done in these playoffs has been let's just double the ball handler, against this Heat with their shooters in constant motion doubling the ball could get them ran out the gym especially since almost every Heat player is capable at making quick decisions in 4 on 3 situations that we've seen the Nuggets, Blazers, and especially the Rockets were not able to do so.

&#x200B;

The Heat offensively with their handoffs with Bam PnR should scare the Lakers, the Heat no surprise lead the NBA in points off handoffs and the Lakers are a slightly below average team in defending this action. Miami should do this action very frequently versus the Lakers.

&#x200B;

Heat should kill the non Lebron minutes, if I'm Spo I am playing Bam with all my amazing offensive only players in these minutes and they should be able to kill the Lakers in these minutes. Rondo and Kuzma have improved on defense but still have moments were they are lost or not engaged especially off ball and Miami should be able to feast off of those two especially if the Lakers keep throwing out Dwight in those AD w/o Lebron minutes.

&#x200B;

I don't expect a good Jimmy Butler series, the Lakers length is so good at the rim but especially if Lebron goes there, I don't see Butler doing much of anything in that matchup and we know he won't get his usual bailout fouls against Lebron who is probably one of the lowest foul rate defenders we've seen.

&#x200B;

TL:DR, I have Lakers in 6, Miami has too many players that are crucial to their offense that against a Lebron led team are going to get hunted, Lakers shooting isn't good but I believe we will see a common theme for these playoffs that as long they are able to stay above 30% which is not good the Lakers should be fine. Give me your thoughts, what do you agree/disagree with and more importantly let's get ready for the finals!",nbadiscussion

1588,593,Why is there no uniformity in All Time Great list in the way we determine greatness?,"Some people favor longevity for certain players , but then don't really apply it to others in nearly the same way .(For instance John Stockton for top 5 point guards for longevity and durability  and a 10 time all star , but no one says the same for Elvin Hayes who leads all power forwards in rebounds and is 2nd in points behind Karl Malone and was an all star for 12 consecutive years,  or Mark Jackson who is 4th on the all time assist list is never in any discussion about point guards.

&#x200B;

 Or people will focus on on court impact for some players and dismiss that same criteria in place of gaudy stats for another player for instance Steve Nash vs Allen Iverson , Nash in his prime led the Mavericks and Suns to the 1st or 2nd ranked offenses 7 straight years while in Iverson's prime his team's offenses were rarely above 15th and often 23rd or below.

&#x200B;

Some people argue what your skills make up is what really important for instance if you were a closer like Michael Jordan and then dismiss Isiah Thomas who was the best player on 2 title winning teams and has some obviously legendary clutch exploits of his own(like the time he had 25 points in a quarter which is right up there with the ""flu game"" in nba lore

&#x200B;

there are even people who argue about resume and use it to put Jordan at #1 even though Kareem Abdul Jabbar's accomplishments actually are tangibly better (all time points leader, 6 MVP's, 19 time all star, 6 titles, 15 time all nba, 11 all defensive teams would be the all time blocks leader if they counted blocks in his 1st 4 seasons )

1590,595,Why did the NBA's scoring efficiency suck in 1998-2004?,"According to [basketball-refence](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats_per_poss.html), all of these 6 seasons rank in the bottom six in points scored per 100 possessions in all of the 3-point era. That blows my mind! 
  
Could anyone help me understand why this is? Never watched this era, this was the time when Raptors were my favorite team because they had a dinosaur as their logo. Was it mainly bad offense or good defense across the league, rules, or a combination of all three?  
  
From what I can gather from stats, we had some all-time defensive monsters like Duncan, Mutombo, Garnett and Wallace. We didn't have any all-time offensive systems during that era - Dirk and Nash's Dallas in 02-04 was by far the best offense of that era. [Rule changes also explain a little,](http://archive.nba.com/analysis/rules_history.html) as they had just shifted the three point line back to the original. On the other hand, it looks like defense was made more difficult almost every season. Although, I guess the real difference maker was the hand-checking rule in 2004, after which offenses started to blossom.",nbadiscussion
1591,596,Usage Percentage is the most misused stat between fans and some experts today,"I often see people try to use this stat to determine who has the ball more/who is the most ball-dominant player in the league and etc.

So, let's take a look at the formula for USG%, according to Basketball Reference:

""Usage Percentage (available since the 1977-78 season in the NBA); the formula is 100 * ((FGA + 0.44 * FTA + TOV) * (Tm MP / 5)) / (MP * (Tm FGA + 0.44 * Tm FTA + Tm TOV)). Usage percentage is an estimate of the percentage of team plays used by a player while he was on the floor.""

Do you see anything wrong there? It doesn't count assists, potential assists or even pass-to-assists. USG% only determines how much a player shoots or finishes a play. It doesn't determine how ball-dominant a player is, or how much he participates in a team's offense. Please, don't let people use it in that way. I've seen even writers and experts using it like that and it just blows my mind that no one has told them this yet.

For example, Nikola Jokic today is not even in the top 30 highest USG% of the 2018-19 season, with guys like Randle, Valanciunas and Rose in front of him. And the entire Nuggets offense runs though him when he's on the floor. ",nbadiscussion

1593,598,[OC] Three Point Shot Selection of Popular Players: Who Takes the Deepest Threes?,"(Note: All data stretches from the 14-15 season until the current season so far)

&nbsp;

Hey fellas,

&nbsp;

A few weeks back I made a post on the nba subreddit about who was taking the longest threes. I made a couple of mistakes so I decided to fix them and add a couple things before posting here. This post is somewhat of a continuation of my [post about the best three point shooters](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/al5ugf/oc_a_quick_visualization_on_the_top_20_three/)

&nbsp;

First, I started by running a super quick program to check the top 20 players in longest average 3 point attempt distance since the 14-15 season (min 800 attempts) and plotted it against 3P%.

&nbsp;

[Here is the plot with heaves taken OUT of the equation](https://imgur.com/a/YzCFl9I)

&nbsp;

Size of the circle is scaled (squared relationship) with attempts per game. Someone in the original post commented how they thought it would be more interesting to look at the distance of popular players, rather than the top 20 by distance, since there are some random names in this list. Someone also suggested I do the same analysis but adjust for corner attempts.

&nbsp;

To adjust for those two things, I used only more popular 3-point shooting players, and I ran a program which calculates average above the break (ABT) three point attempt distance, but disregards corner attempts. Since corner threes physically cannot be ""deep"", I wanted to answer the question: when players ARE able to take a deep shot, how deep do they shoot it? 

&nbsp;

For example, a player who takes half their shots at the corner from 22 feet and half from 28 above the break will show up at a pedestrian 25 feet even though half their shots are stupidly deep. Since I didn't want to lose information by disregarding corner attempts completely, I graphed it against % of three point attempts at the corner. 

&nbsp;

[Here is the graph](https://imgur.com/a/f4mMXVC)

&nbsp;

I decided to opt against scaling size with attempts on this one because the graph had a little too much going on in it. I still wanted to be able to visualize three point percentage, so I did it by color gradient. Red means higher three point percentage, blue means lower. Essentially, bottom right means you take very difficult shots. Top left means you take (relatively) very easy shots. This of course doesn't take into account how many of these shots are assisted, or how many of them are tightly guarded, so it's not a perfect measure of difficulty.

&nbsp;

While the difference between, say, Curry and Kyrie might not be very significant, Hield, Korver, Butler, Kawhi, and Westbrook all take their ABT threes at an entire foot closer than Curry on average, which can make a pretty big difference over thousands of attempts, since nearly every high volume player shoots better from the corner by a few percentage points vs above the break. What do you guys think?

1596,601,Do you think a player could average 40 PPG within the next decade?,"In the next ten years, do you think a player good average 40 PPG in the regular season? Personally, I think its possible for a few reasons. The transition to some offenses flowing through an individual star (i.e. Doncic, Giannis, Harden, Lebron) has seen the usage rates of the leagues best perimeter players skyrocket. This is a trend that I think will become more prevalent with more stars as more teams shift to using one player as the focal point of their offense. 

The other major reason I think this will happen is the next step in the 3 point revolution. A combination of more small ball lineups where 4-5 players can hit the three (as we have seen with D'Antoni's Rockets post-Capela trade) and the ever increasing amount of deep 3s could prove to be the second wave in the 3 pt. revolution. 

Other factors include the changes to the shot clock on offensive rebounds, players getting more FTs, and the in general faster pace of play.

So is it possible? I think so and I think the player most likely to achieve this is Trae Young. He still takes more 2s than 3s and shoots a modestly from both. I think he is capable of dramatically increasing his FG%, generating more trips to the free through line, and efficiently weaponizing deep 3s.",nbadiscussion
1597,602,The One Before You Meet the One: Why Kenny Atkinson’s Departure Makes Sense,"During the underrated romantic period of the mid-2000s, Dane Cook and Jessica Alba stared in *Good Luck Chuck,* with a plot centered around Dane Cook’s character being a good luck charm for girls to meet the love of their life after meeting him. Its not a terrible movie but watching it literally minutes before Kenny Atkinson and the New Jersey Nets parted ways didn’t seem like just coincidental timing.


Atkinson joined the Nets back in 2016, with a resume of being from the coaching trees of Mike D’Antoni and Mike Budenholzer. Recognized as one of the better head coach prospects in the league, his experience in player development with the Houston Rockets and studying under offensive gurus, it made all of the sense in the world why the ‘desperate for resources’ Nets wanted him—he could possibly work with nothing.


For his three and a half seasons with the Nets, he would accomplish what was expected of him. He would turn around a group of lackluster talent and unproven stars into a possible Eastern Conference contender. With the signings of Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant, we all thought it would lead them to the promise land. Until it didn’t. 


People are going to be quick to blame the newly introduced star players but what — hear me out — if there were legitimate reasons for why the talent and the coach may not have worked out and Sean Marks is stopping the inevitable?


It first begins with the 5-Out Motion offense. 


A common offense used when teaching the game of basketball and infamously used by Bob Huggins, it focuses on position-less basketball, and as a basketball camp of mine coach once called, “an offense for players that suck.” All five players will start around the perimeter and with the use of active screens and cuts, open up the paint and create outlet opportunities. It can be a difficult system to learn but once a simple understanding is developed, its solid. Its the foundation is what we see in most modern NBA offenses.


Atkinson’s take on the offense wasn’t much different from the standard 5-Out system. This was partially because the lack of presence in the 5 and Jarrett Allen, once drafted, taking some time to develop. But rather than focuses on catch-and-shoot opportunities, Atkinson focused on the drive. The Nets has been Top-4 in drives-per-game since Atkinson has taken the helm. This is partially due to the usage of high screen versus keeping the five off in the corner. 


What’s also surprisingly weird is how poor the team shoots in catch-and-shoot scenarios, ranking in the bottom quarter of the NBA for the past four years. Because if you think about it, you would hope that the wing could be accountable if the ball is kicked out. Joe Harris alone should bring the Nets at least to the top-half of the league.  


The 5-Out Motion Offense also needs a ball dominant guard and can often takeaway possessions from other members on the floor. Kyrie Irving ranks 10th in usage rate this year, D’Angelo Russell ranked 10th in 2018-19 and 16th in 2017-18. The system benefited both in different ways — Russell found his game and Kyrie was able to re-find his game. And this is fine -- because we know Kyrie and Russell are good at the game of basketball.


But for others, it wasn’t necessarily their cup of tea. Caris LeVert has been much more comfortable in isolation systems—as well as Spencer Dinwiddie. While both have been able to succeed with their talent, it could be argued a different offensive set could suit them better.  And because of the position-less basketball aspect to the game, it has stunted or halted the abilities of Jarrett Allen and hindered the reasons why you bring in guys like DeAndre Jordan. Because you aren’t necessarily setting up a pick-and-roll scenario, it can confuse your big man on an offensive possession—see nearly every single DeAndre Jordan high screen to open a possession that distorts the spacing of the offense. Brooklyn ranks 25th in turnovers per-game because of inefficient spacing. 


On the opposite side of the court, there isn’t much to discuss. They, like most teams, have taken on a soft-zone system. With Jarrett Allen on the court, the team does limit their opponent’s ability to score at the rim, ranking towards the best in the league in related statistics. However, they also have the question mark of having the third lowest steals-per-game, something that you don’t necessarily expected with a soft-man. The lack of great perimeter defensive has lead to the mid-range jumper becoming even easier for teams. 


But even in all of this discussion, we’re not seeing any improvements. And people will mention that Kevin Durant isn’t playing this season, Kyrie Irving tested the waters with the team but is likely done this year with his injury. Over the four years under Atkinson, the Nets improved their field goal attempts (+5 per game), three point attempts (+6.4 attempts), 2-point field goal percentage (+1.9%), total rebounds (+4.6 per game) and overall points per game (+5.1). They're seeing their first decline in overall performance this year. In the context of the injuries, seems legit. However, in the context of their dream’s and aspirations, it may not be good enough.


Mark Jackson was infamously let-go from his position as head coach of the Golden State Warriors after ownership felt he wasn’t the guy that could make the most use of the talent that was brought in. The Warriors were right. Instead of the lazy offensive system implemented by Jackson, Steve Kerr’s motion offense would bring the most out of Steph Kerry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. Jason Kidd was kicked out of Milwaukee for Mike Budenholzer. We're witnessing that story.


And its even more understandable with the NBA having a relatively high turnover ratio of head coaching gigs—with the average coach lasting between 2-and-3 seasons before decisions are made regarding their future. 


Kenny Atkinson deserves all of the credit in the world for what he was able to accomplish with the Brooklyn Nets in his time with the team and he will likely get a job in the near future — which was kind of nice from Sean Marks and Brooklyn to speed up  that process. If we remove the context and focus on what is in front of us, it all makes sense.


The Nets made the playoffs one time in four years, the progression of the team halted this season and the team could arguably be reaching its apex within the next 2-seasons. Its understandable that they want to be in the best position possible, likely bringing in a coach with play-off experience, for guidance. You want an experienced pilot to guide you through a storm versus a relatively green pilot. 


In his one play-off series as a head coach, the team was eliminated in an incredibly winnable series against a poorly coached Philadelphia 76ers line-up. Despite winning Game 1, his lack of experience showed and his plan to improve from that time never came to fruition. To put it bluntly, it feels like that even with his improvement and development, he was reaching his apex with the organization. And its a shame because in the history books, we won’t write Kenny’s name. We’ll write the person after him.


He has created the foundation and gathered the pieces but someone else will make the needed change. It could be the decision of how Jarrett Allen and DeAndre exist, it could be how does LaVert get more time in the spotlight, it could be Kevin Durant simply existing. We’ll just have to wait and find out.


Tyronn Lue is the likely candidate and it would make all of the sense in the world to bring him in. And if they do, we may be recognizing it as an improvement. You don’t rest easy in professional sports, you always want to improve. The Brooklyn organization shouldn’t be discredited for attempting to do so.",nbadiscussion

1601,606,Adam Silver appreciation post,"In defence of the mid-season tournament: Saying it won’t work may just be a self fulfilling prophecy... here’s why. 

The leagues obviously going through a ratings crisis at the moment and one aspect is the structure of the regular season. Adam Silver seems to be trying to change things; one major proposal is the mid season tournament.

I’m all for arguing about the possible success or features of the tournament but I see so many people dismissing it on a general basis of ‘it won’t mean anything’ or ‘players won’t care’. When we talk about ‘value’ so much of it comes down to what we all agree on and assign to something. Put simply, the universe doesn’t assign value we do. 

So to simply dismiss the tournament is a bit redundant. Instead it is more useful to look at the factors that would give the tournament value. First and foremost; under the right circumstances would it be good basketball to watch. 

Personally I like the idea of the tournament featuring the mid-table teams. I think the top tier teams are really showcased in the playoffs but watching teams like the Suns compete against other teams in the 6-8 region would be fun. The tournament may well hold MORE value to up and coming stars instead off veterans like Harden. With the volatility of a knockout format that could be great to watch. 

Overall, saying the tournament won’t work may very well be a SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY because it will negate any value it holds. 

Good on Adam Silver for tying to innovate.",nbadiscussion

1603,608,"In hindsight, was the Butler to Minnesota trade a good one?","On June 22, 2017, the Minnesota Timberwolves traded Zach Lavine, Kris Dunn and the 7th overall pick (which would become Lauri Markkanen) to the Chicago Bulls for Jimmy Butler and the 16th pick (which would become Justin Patton).

At the time, this was seen as a great trade for the Wolves. Obtaining a legit number 1 option for a team sorely in need of a veteran presence was a home run move even considering what it took to get him.

However, now that we look back on it, knowing what happened after (the Wolves made the playoffs once and Butler was traded mid next season to the Sixers for Dario and RoCo), was the trade worth it for the Wolves?  They gave up a solid defensive/playmaking PG and a dude in Lavine who looks like he could be a second/third option on a championship team (My opinion), plus a pick which could've been anyone from Markkanen, to Donovan Mitchell, to John Collins (though their scouting would have to be top notch to hit some of those.) 

If you were the GM of the Wolves, knowing what happened next, would you still pull the trigger?",nbadiscussion
1604,609,Possible Kevin Love trade to Miami,"Miami is a very good team this season. They are likely headed for a top four seed in the East. However, they still have their deficiencies, and while they are able to hang with top teams like the Lakers as seen tonight, there is always room for improvement. Kevin Love’s public availability may be a good opportunity to reinforce their frontcourt in a win now effort.


Miami gives

-	Dion Waiters (12.1)

-	Meyers Leonard (11.2 expiring)

-	James Johnson (15.3m)


Cleveland gives

-	Kevin Love (28.9m)

-	John Henson (9.7m expiring)



Why Miami does it:
Consolidates marginal players all with contracts that will expire by 2021. None of these pieces are important moving forward. Since Miami is capped out, their best chance at acquiring a capable starter is via trade. Kevin Love gives them defensive rebounding and three point shooting next to Bam in place of Olynyk/Leonard. In this instance, Love’s contract duration may even be beneficial to Miami so they have contract control over another quality player.


Why Cleveland does it:
Long term flexibility. This is a Cleveland team still firmly at square one of the rebuild. One of the best ways to accelerate that process would be to unload Love’s max. While in the short term it is not immediately rewarding to create cap space for a cratering team, the landscape of the NBA radically shifts quickly. In three years, it’s entirely possible Cleveland finds a franchise cornerstone. Not having Love’s contract around makes it far easier to surround a young core with veteran contributors.


Picks may ultimately be the hangup in this deal. Cleveland has insisted they want a first for Love. Miami has their first this year but that also represents the opportunity to develop a player on a rookie contract into a rotation guy. They may feel entitled to draft compensation given Love’s albatross status. It is probably the  best fit for him if he wants to move to a contender though.",nbadiscussion
1605,610,How will the NBA/China resolve itself?,"The CCP does not operate in a top down dictatorial manner, unlike states like Saudi Arabia or North Korea, where succession planning is based on heredity. The CCP has never had leadership pass in any sort of hereditary way, in fact, leadership is chosen based on election by CCP members.

In China there a a total of 90 million CCP members, that's about 7% of the country. These are the ruling elites of the country. They actually vote through a multi-step process for the leader of the CCP. You might actually liken it to the electoral process at the beginning of the US, where only white landowning men were allowed to participate, in China only CCP members are allowed to vote.

Within those members of the CCP, there is constant activity and battle to position themselves to rise through the ranks and reach ever more senior positions.

This entire episode can be viewed through the prism of various party members trying to win public support by being more ""woke"". You see, just like American politicians can gain support by bashing China, Chinese politicians can get more support by bashing America. So this slew of organisations ""banning"" the Rockets and NBA is a woke performative dance trying to curry public opinion and favor.

Neither side will back down, since by backing down it would mean losing face, in America's case, it would be like someone admitting that freedom of speech is not important.  From the Chinese side, it would be like someone admitting that territorial soverignty was not important.

I can see 2 scenarios where this could realistically resolve, since Morey fired/resigning or either side giving in is not going to happen.

1) Someone gets killed - Some sort of tragedy would wake everyone up that it's only a game and that everyone is taking it too far and in the aftermath of the tragedy, there would be healing.

2) Yao Ming reaches over to Morey and they reconcile in some public way - Yao Ming has the most credibility since he is the FIRST person to boycott the rockets in the aftermath of this incident, in fact, every single company followed his lead thus making him a de facto leader on this topic.",nbadiscussion

**Rodrigue Beaubois; 40 pts/8 trb/3 ast    DAL 111 - 90 GSW (Mar 27 2010)**

One night in march, Rodrigue Beaubois (who?) came off the bench and lit up the dubs for a career high 40 points. making 9 of 11 from deep, Beaubois would never top 24 again, playing only four short season with the Mavs.

1609,614,[OC] The MVP Award and NBA Media Groupthink,"[tl;dr: Over the last few years, the NBA Media has trended toward consensus when voting for the MVP. I think it sucks](https://imgur.com/gkKDKng)

**** 

In 1981, the NBA revamped it's process for voting on the MVP. Up until then, it was the players themselves who voted on the award. But beginning in that 1981 season, the NBA shifted the responsibility to a panel of media members. 

Most would agree that it's not ideal that the media votes on these awards. They are, after all, the ones covering the league and its not difficult to see how a conflict of interest could arise (ie, reporters trading votes for access). 

I'm less interested in the conflict of interest (although I think it's important and not talked about enough) than I am with the idea of groupthink among media members. 

####[Using data from basketball-reference, I looked at the number of players each season receiving **at least one first place vote** for MVP.](https://imgur.com/gkKDKng).####

From the chart it's pretty clear to me that there has been trend toward consensus in recent years. Up until the late aughts it was common for 4 or more players to receive first place votes. But lately it's become increasingly rare. 

Consider this: There were just three seasons between 1981 and 2010 in which only two players received first place votes (1986, 1997, and 2000). But since 2010, it's happened five times. This year will likely mark the sixth time its happened since 2010 because Giannis and LeBron are the only two candidates anyone is seriously considering. 

I partially blame social media for this trend. In 2014, the NBA began publicizing the awards and it's likely led to some media members voting in line with their peers out of fear of backlash from the Twitter mob.

Sam Amick of the Athletic [has been quoted as saying:](https://hoopshype.com/2019/04/16/behind-the-scenes-with-nba-award-voters-fear-of-social-media-reprisal-is-real/)

> ""Fear of social-media reprisal, if you will, is real. It’s hard to not see that as a factor... But there are definitely some people who feel that a few years ago, had votes not been publicized, Stephen Curry wouldn’t have won unanimously. In 2015-16, it kind of reached a point where there were no other candidates [perceived to be on the same level] so you were going to look like an idiot if you voted for anybody else other than Steph.”

Nobody wants to get dunked on for voting outside the box. I can sympathize with that. 

But shit, I missed when players like Elton Brand (2006), Jermaine O'Neal (2004), Peja Stojakovic (2004), and T-Mac (2002/2003) were *actually* in the conversation for MVP and accordingly received first place votes. Nowadays, when we talk about who is in the conversation for MVP we're usually only talking about two players at most. 

(To be fair, most of those fringe candidates in the past were likely (we don't know for sure) getting votes from their local broadcasters. However, [the NBA took away votes from local broadcasters votes in 2017.](https://www.sbnation.com/2017/4/4/15182804/nba-strips-local-broadcasters-voting-league-awards))

It sort of surprises me that an alternative NBA Awards ballot voted on by someone other than NBA media members hasn't sprung up. Someone tell [Jay Caspian Kang](https://twitter.com/jaycaspiankang) to form the NBA Dark Web he's always talking about for the express purposes of competing with the NBA awards.",nbadiscussion

1612,617,"A quick rundown on the odds for the Timberwolves 2021 first rd pick, currently owned by the Warriors","When the Warriors acquired Andrew Wiggins from the Timberwolves and their 2021 first round pick, almost immediately the trade talks began.  Which star will they be able to trade Wiggins plus the Wolves pick for?  A throwback to the infamous TT, Shump and Nets pick trade package from 2017

&#x200B;

I just wanted to provide some context on the true value of this Wolves pick.  The pick is top-3 protected for 2021, and unprotected afterwards.  This means that if the Wolves end up with the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd pick in next year's draft, they keep the pick.  If you are a bottom 3 team record-wise, you have a 52% landing one of the top 3 picks.

&#x200B;

Now, the Wolves *probably* will not be one of the three worst teams in the league again.  Four of their five players from last year's opening day starting lineup are gone (just KAT remains).  Towns missed nearly half the season with a few different injuries.  The offense was running a play style it absolutely did NOT have the proper personnel for to begin the year (3rd in the league in 3pt attempts per game, 28th in 3pt %).  

&#x200B;

Additionally, there is a lot of speculation that the Wolves will trade their first overall pick this year (and'or the 17th and 33rd picks, James Johnson's expiring contract, Jarrett Culver) for a more immediate contributor to playing winning basketball .  Essentially, the only given right now is that KAT and D Lo will be on the opening day roster next season, and that the team will not be tanking at all (since they have no draft pick) - everything else is up in the air

&#x200B;

All these things considered, I think its fair to say maybe the Wolves will end up with roughly the 7th worst record in the league next year (might be better depending on the player they may trade for, might be worse if they stay put and keep their draft picks).  So let's go with 7th worst for the sake of discussion.  Here is what those odds would look like:

&#x200B;

Top 3 pick (Wolves get to keep it): **23%**

7-9 pick (goes to Golden State): **67%** 

4th pick (goes to Golden State): **8.5%**

&#x200B;

Anyways, this just gives you a picture of what teams would be looking at if they trade for the Wolves pick.  Obviously this get real interesting if the Wolves do in fact end up keeping it for 2021, because afterwards it becomes completely unprotected, and that much more valuable.",nbadiscussion
1613,618,"With today's rules, what is the best possible starting 5 you can create from all players past and present?","
I'm thinking Curry and MJ at 1 and 2. 
Durant at 3. Miami LeBron at 4, and Tim Duncan at 5.

I'm choosing Curry to open the floor with his shooting, and his playmaking. 

MJ because he's MJ. 

Durant because he's of the best sfs of all time, he can defend and rebound and is a matchup nightmare, but mostly because he can shoot and space the floor.

LeBron is LeBron, he does (did, in Miami) everything well, and is a great secondary playmaker when MJ is tired. 

And Duncan over guys like Wilt or Kareem because Duncan doesn't need the ball, he's an amazing defender, passer and rebounder, unselfish, intelligent, great team player. I feel like the other big men like shaq wouldn't be as effective in this role, and I want my offense going through MJ, LeBron, and maybe a little Curry instead of relying on post play from the great big men of the past. 

I'm considering swapping LeBron for Bird actually - this current team only has 2 knockdown shooters, but swapping LeBron for Bird means there are three guys opening the lane for MJ and Bird is still an all time great. Plus you could run some crazy plays with Curry, Duncan and Bird, those guys are super crafty.

1615,620,McGee vs Howard. Questions from a recent basketball fan.,"So I've really only had an interest in basketball in the last couple of years of my life and I'm still trying to learn more every day. Because of this I have limited knowledge and was hoping to get some better insight.

For whatever reason I've decided that I like Javale McGee and think that's he's a pretty awesome player. 

I've been noticing more and more than people are claiming how much better of a player Howard is and that he should be taking more time from McGee. Is this true? Could there be reasons for his better stats? Maybe because McGee is a starter going against other starters would surely sway the numbers when Howard is coming in later vs other players? 

Or is one actually just better than the other? 

Anyway thank you!

** edit **

Fantastic input from everyone. Definitely helpful for me. I still like Javale a lot but I am totally sold on Dwight now. Thank you!",nbadiscussion
1616,621,Players you misjudged or underestimated because you saw them near the end of their careers,"I grew up watching ball in the mid/late 80s as a kid during the height of the Lakers-Celtics rivalry.  To me, Dennis Johnson was a tough defender, but also the funny-looking pudgy guy that looked like someone's uncle.  Sure, he was a Celtic starter, so he had to be good, but still.  I never knew about his Sonics and Suns stints, and also that he was a afroed high flyer that put up points and had some attitude issues.

Another guy was Adrian Dantley.  I only saw him on the Pistons for a bit and then how the Aguirre trade pushed them over the top.  I would have had no idea what an offensive force he was with the Utah Jazz just a few years earlier. 

On the other hand, I remember having quickly known about the reputations of guys like Moses Malone before he was a Hawk, or Bernard King on the Bullets, so I always had the notion that they used to be big-time players that could still drop numbers on you.  

It all depends on what era you grew up in.  I saw the entire careers of late 80s rookies, so there were no real surprises from then on.  I'm interested to hear the perspectives of younger or older fans about players that were misunderstood because of only seeing them at the tail end of their careers.",nbadiscussion
1617,622,Reason OKC has to change coaches: three straight years of Russ rebounding to lead fast breaks that are bottom percentile. Need new coach to implement half court offense,"Russ had his reign with three straight years of triple doubles.

The offense just needs to change. Russ p&r was ran so much in playoffs and only had 0.66 PPP. Essentially OKC offense had no cuts.

Okc with brooks used to have Nick collision get ball in mid range. There would be Kevin Martin or Durant running and head fake from going to 3 and instead to rim. The cut leads to easy buckets.

Adams has alot of potential if he can get the ball in mid range and post up area.

He can also setup great screens in the paint.

The way OKC has played is just not the right way to play. Russ controlling the offense by rebounding the ball should be much less.

Russ needs to be used more in off ball scenarios. Hell he was so great in 2012 and 2013 playing off ball. Now he just stands 5 feet from 3 point line.

I don't understand why the coach doesn't innovate on the offense. He doesn't move Russ around on offense. Russ should be running off screens or cutting to the hope more often.


It's been 4 seasons with Donovan, and he really hasn't innovated the offense. Need a new coach.",nbadiscussion

1619,624,An explanation of why Lebron hasn’t looked great offensively (by his standards) these playoffs.,"A lot of people have been talking about why Lebron hasn’t looked himself in the last couple of games offensively. I have some theories. I’ve compiled a list of what I think is causing his problems, in no particular order of importance.

1.	The spacing of the lakers sucks. While the 2018 cavs were terrible overall. The one thing they had was elite spacing. The cavs almost always played 5 out, and when they didn’t Lebron ran pick and roll with TT. Most of the time, Lebron only had to beat his man, and if he did, he had a good look at the rim, or even if the defense doubled , Lebron had an easy kick out to a good shooter. Easy offense. The lakers on the other hand have no shooters. I don’t think Lebron has seen the paint this packed since 2011.
2.	 The nuggets have gone with the “build the wall” strategy against Lebron, and without the gravity of any shooters, it’s clearly messed Lebron up. Lebron simply cannot go up and around 3 defenders at this point of his career. This is causing him to settle for bad jumpers. 
3.	the bubble schedule. These games finish around midnight and they have to play 36 hours later. This take its toll on everyone, but Lebron is one of the oldest players in the bubble. It’s going to take a hard toll on his body more than the young guns. 
4.	Lebron is playing defense. A lot of people are asking how Lebron played 45 mpg of elite offense in 2018, but looks tired only playing 37 mpg in the playoffs. Well Lebron is playing all-nba level defense these playoffs. He barely played defense at all in 2018. Defense at that level is more tiring than offense, this is leading to his legs being more tired on offense. 
5.	he’s getting old and his stamina and first step are declining. The hard truth is Lebron is getting older. To be honest he hasn’t looked the same athletically since his groin injury in 2018 and probably never will again. The older you get the harder it is to get your body to 100% night in and night out. It’s sad to see, but Father Time is undefeated",nbadiscussion

I understand people have opinions and I do too but for me I feel like I understand how it feels to be a fan of players as well. I love my team as well but I understand people rooting for a player and I see how criticism from fans on sites like this can get you worked up. It’s like with players like

 Ben Simmons, I don’t  really like him much outside his basketballl abilities but I respect the talent he has. I feel like people are so harsh on players that aren’t top ten, aren’t efficient, aren’t great defenders, etc. For me I think it becomes too harsh and I feel players have to face these massive expectations all the time.

1621,626,Is Andrew Wiggins turning the corner?,"There are 43 players in the NBA who are averaging [20-3-3 on a 36 minute average](http://bkref.com/tiny/Fl2T2). One of them is Andrew Wiggins. This is arguably his best 10 game start in his career and is shooting above league average on eFG (.527 v. .518) for the first time in his career.

Granted, this is just 1/8th of the season so far and Wiggins has had moments where ""there's something there"" and then we see month or season-long funks where Wiggins shoots horrifically and at high volume.

Wiggins' shot selection is better this year - 27% of his shots are at the rim and he's making about 67% of those shots. From 2, he is shooting 53% on the season so far as he's cut down on the frequency of long twos and is taking 48% of his total shots within 10 ft.

A lot of Wolves fans hoped for a better, more ""dialed in"" player and didn't know if he was ever going to figure it out. While this is still a very sample size in a long season, it does look like Wiggins is at least showing signs of turning the corner and playing respectable basketball.",nbadiscussion
1622,627,[OC] Load Management and You: How to get the Best Value when you are buying tickets to an NBA game,"Earlier today, a quote from Doris Burke about the effect of load management on the league's regular season watchability and fan interest made the front page. This triggered a thought in my mind - *Suppose I am buying tickets to an NBA game and I want to see a star/superstar play. Which star/superstar is the most guaranteed to put on a show, and more importantly, least likely to be load managed/injured?*


Obviously, one of the first players that came to mind was Karl-Anthony Towns. It seems like unless he gets hit by a car or choked out by Embiid, he's going to show up and he's going to get buckets. 


To do a more quantitative and comprehensive approach, I came up with the following criteria. I wanted to look for players under age 30 (younger players get load managed less) who had the most seasons with at least [**75 GS** (~90% of the season), **30 MPG**, **20 PPG**, **0.5486 TS%**]. I searched only the past 4 seasons (since 2015-16) to ensure that the results were recent enough to serve as a basis for forecasting. The 0.5486 TS% was the league average across the previous 4 seasons.


I chose those particular criteria because I believe most casual fans would probably like to see a guy who can score the basketball, do it relatively efficiently, play most of the game, and have at least a 90% probability of actually playing. Whether or not you believe these stats correlate perfectly with winning basketball, they do represent a player that can do those 4 things.


Using these qualifiers, I did a simple query of Basketball Reference's Total Season Finder. 
[Here are the results:](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&match=total&type=totals&per_minute_base=36&per_poss_base=100&season_start=1&season_end=-1&lg_id=NBA&age_min=0&age_max=99&is_active=Y&is_playoffs=N&height_min=0&height_max=99&year_min=2016&year_max=2020&birth_country_is=Y&as_comp=gt&as_val=0&pos_is_g=Y&pos_is_gf=Y&pos_is_f=Y&pos_is_fg=Y&pos_is_fc=Y&pos_is_c=Y&pos_is_cf=Y&c1stat=gs&c1comp=gt&c1val=75&c2stat=mp_per_g&c2comp=gt&c2val=30&c3stat=pts_per_g&c3comp=gt&c3val=20&c4stat=ts_pct&c4comp=gt&c4val=0.5486&order_by=ws)

For the lazy, **Kemba Walker** and **Paul George** have done this all 4 of the past 4 seasons. **Bradley Beal**, **Damian Lillard**, **Klay Thompson**, **James Harden**, and **Karl Anthony-Towns** have done it thrice in the past 4 seasons. Look for when these players are coming to town if you want to avoid being disappointed by load management.

 

**FINAL NOTE:** If you remove the TS% qualifier, **Demar Derozan**, **CJ McCollum**, and **Russell Westbrook** join the club of having done 3 seasons passing the criteria. Based on this, getting tickets to Blazers games when they visit your city is going to give you the best bang for your buck because it is extremely probable that both Dame and CJ (or at the very least one of them) will be suiting up.",nbadiscussion
1623,628,"How Bad is Russell Westbrook’s Contract, Really? Using CARMELO to Examine NBA Contracts","Since Woj reported that the Thunder are blowing it up, a lot has been said about the difficulty of trading Russell Westbrook, mostly due to his massive contract, which pays him almost $170 million over the next four years. Media figures such as Bill Simmons have gone as far as saying it’s possibly the second worst in the league. At first glance, it’s not an outrageous claim. Russ turns 31 in November, and is due $47 million in his age 34 season (yes, he will be picking up that Player Option). However, as we know, most NBA superstars are underpaid in their prime. Russ may be on the tail end of his own prime, but does the value surplus he provides now exceed the coming deficit during decline?

FiveThirtyEight recently published [this](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-nba-free-agents-got-paid-too-much-and-too-little/) article examining the best bargains and biggest overpays of the NBA’s 2019 free agency class. In their analysis, they assign a market value for next season using their proprietary CARMELO player projection model, and then compare that dollar amount to the player’s actual salary in 2019–20. This is great, but what about beyond this coming season? We can dig deeper.

# What is CARMELO?

I’ll let the people who created it tell you.

> FiveThirtyEight’s Career-Arc Regression Model Estimator with Local Optimization (CARMELO) is a system that forecasts a player‘s future performance. Wins above replacement projections are based on a combination of regular-season and playoff performances. The similarity score is an index measuring how comparable one player is to another, scaled such that a score of zero is average similarity and 100 is the highest possible degree of similarity. Plus-minus is derived from Box Plus/Minus, a measure of the number of points per 100 possessions that a player contributed to his team, relative to an average NBA player. 

When you plug a player into CARMELO, you get a nice graph showing their projected Wins Above Replacement (WAR) with a 90% confidence interval, a player category (for Russ it’s “MVP candidate”), and a 5-year projected Market Value. Below that is a table full of data, including year-by-year numbers for Plus/Minus, WAR, and Market Value.

The metric doesn’t always match conventional wisdom or the eye test (Klay Thompson is an average starter according to CARMELO). However, I do trust that FiveThirtyEight is a lot closer to a player’s true market value than any back-of-a-napkin calculations I could do myself.

# Analyzing Westbrook’s Value

According to CARMELO, Westbrook’s value over the remaining seasons of his current contract are as follows:

* 2019–20: $64.8m (Salary: $38.5m)
* 2020–21: $55.8m (Salary: $41.4m)
* 2021–22: $43.3m (Salary: $44.2m)
* 2022–23: $39.8m (Salary: $47.1m)

As we can see, Russell Westbrook is paid significantly below his market value for the first two years of his contract, accruing a surplus of **$40.7 million** for his team. After that, his value tapers off, and the final two years of the contract have a deficit of **$8.2 million**.

Conclusion? Russell Westbrook, despite his gargantuan contract, is projected to provide a net surplus of **$32.5 million** to his team over the course of his contract. That’s not to say that it’s a great deal — especially if he suffers a serious injury. But, for a team that wants to go all in, future be damned, maybe it’s not such a bad move to take on Westbrook.

# What about John Wall?

It’s consensus that Wizards PG John Wall’s contract is the worst in the league. He tore his Achilles in February, and might miss all of next season. Funnily enough, next season is when his 4-year max extension kicks in. Yikes.

I’ll be (extremely) generous and assume Wall will make a miraculous recovery, play 25 or so games, and have a roughly equivalent value to his injury-shortened year last year where he played 32 games. I’m sorry to inform Wizards fans that, even with my generosity and CARMELO’s bullish projection, John Wall’s contract is in fact very bad. Value vs Salary:

* 2019–20: $4.2m (Salary: $38.2m)
* 2020–21: $16.0m (Salary: $41.3m)
* 2021–22: $13.0m (Salary: $44.3m)
* 2022–23: $7.6m (Salary: $47.4m)

This contract has a net deficit of **$130.4 million**. For comparison, CARMELO projects Devin Booker to be worth **$134.7 million** over the same time period. Let me be clear: over the next four years, John Wall will be one (1) Devin Booker less valuable than his salary (and that’s an optimistic estimate).
Is there a worse contract than this in the league? Well…

No, not even close.

**Other Notable Deficits**

Tobias Harris, Philadelphia 76ers:

* 2019–20: $22.3m (Salary: $31.0m)
* 2020–21: $20.0m (Salary: $33.5m)
* 2021–22: $17.3m (Salary: $36.0m)

* 2023–24: $8.7m (Salary: $41.0m)
* Total Deficit: **$99.2 Million**

Khris Middleton, Milwaukee Bucks:

* 2019–20: $23.3m (Salary: $30.7m)
* 2020–21: $20.0m (Salary: $33.1m)
* 2021–22: $17.3m (Salary: $35.6m)
* 2022–23: $12.8m (Salary: $38.1m)
* 2023–24: $8.4m (Salary: $40.5m)
* Total Deficit: **$97.2 Million**

Andrew Wiggins, Minnesota Timberwolves:

* 2018–19: $2.0m (Salary: $25.5m)
* 2019–20: $13.4m (Salary: $27.5m)
* 2020–21: $14.0m (Salary: $29.5m)

* 2022–23: -$13.2m (Salary: $33.6m)
* Total Deficit: **$89.5 Million**

Harrison Barnes, Sacramento Kings:

* 2019–20: $3.5m (Salary: $19.0m)
* 2020–21: $2.4m (Salary: $20.5m)
* 2021–22: $1.6m (Salary: $22.0m)
* 2022–23: -$0.6m (Salary: $23.5m)
* Total Deficit: **$78.1 Million**

# KD is out next season. What about his contract?

Kevin Durant signed a 4 year max with the Brooklyn Nets this summer, but will spend the first year of it on the sidelines recovering from an Achilles tear (hey there, John Wall). Therefore, one might expect that his contract is an Albatross like Wall’s:

* 2019–20: $0m (Salary: $37.2m)
* 2020–21: $51.6m (Salary: $39.1m)
* 2021–22: $44.7m (Salary: $41.0m)
* 2022–23: $35.4m (Salary: $42.9m)
* Total Deficit: **$28.5 Million**

Well, it’s not nearly as bad. When he’s able to play, Durant will actually be underpaid by $8.2 million according to CARMELO. There are two reasons the Nets gave this contract to Durant — one, for those two seasons of expected surplus where they’ll be top title contenders, and two, to secure Kyrie Irving’s signing. Let’s add Kyrie to the mix:

* 2019–20: $53.8m (Salary: $67.9m)
* 2020–21: $104.2m (Salary: $71.4m)
* 2021–22: $91.9m (Salary: $74.9m)
* 2022–23: $78.4m (Salary: $79.4m)
* Total Surplus: **$34.7 Million**

This analysis that includes Kyrie helps us better understand why the Nets were willing to offer Durant this contract. Over the next four years, the pair of Kyrie and KD projects to produce a significant surplus.

# Conclusions

* Russell Westbrook is on a “buy-now” contract — rebuilding teams stay away, but contenders and wannabes might find it worth the risk at the margin.
* John Wall’s contract is as awful as everyone thinks.
* Tobias Harris and Khris Middleton’s deals aren’t great either.
* KD and Kyrie are a great deal, even with a lost season.
* Superstars are severely underpaid in this league.

While this analysis is far from perfect (opportunity cost and the effects of the price ceiling that is the max contract aren’t really accounted for), breaking down player signings into a straightforward cost-benefit analysis provides another lens through which to view the NBA’s contract market.",nbadiscussion

1625,630,Are we not talking enough about all the great role players in this upcoming free agency class?,"Almost every post about free agency is about the Special K stars (Kawhi, KD, Kyrie, Klay, and Kemba).  The rest of the posts are about the Tobias, Jimmy, Boogie, Vuc, etc second tier guys. But, beneath that level are a ton of mostly undiscussed free agents that can be difference makers on most playoff contenders. 

The Following are all upcoming free agents that roughly fit the bill

Danny Green

Patrick Beverly

The Morri

The Lopezes (emphasis on Brook)

Dewayne Dedmon

Half the Pacers roster ( Thad, Tyreke, Bojan, Collison, etc)

Nikola Mirotic

DRose

Julius Randle

JJ Redick

Aminu

Nerlens Noel

Ricky Rubio

Rudy Gay

I think all of these guys could potentially change the fate of a playoff contender but I have heard almost no talk about whether they are going to re-sign, accept options, take their talents to South Beach, or what.  

To be clear, I'm not trying to sound pretentious or judgey or anything. I totally understand why the stars get almost all the free agency buzz. I'm just trying to facilitate a conversation about some of these lower-level free agents right here. Like, I said I have no idea which guys seemed committed to staying or going somewhere else in particular and knowing a little more about that would really help me conceptualize how the upcoming offseason shakes out.

1627,632,Jason Kidd almost joining the Spurs in 2003 - what were the thoughts in 2003 about that almost transaction?,"As any NBA person knows, Kevin Durant was heavily criticized and is now considered a villain in the NBA after leaving the Thunder to join the Warriors. I was 5 years old in 2003 and there were not factors like social media and Spurs were not a cemented dynasty yet (Warriors weren’t either but shit they were 73-9), but I do know J-Kidd said “I committed when I was down there on my visit.""

So I am asking, what were fans thinking and the media saying about the idea of Jason Kidd leaving a championship situation and joining the team that defeated him in the finals the same year? How is it compared to KD signing with the GSW? What were people thinking about the Spurs? What were people thinking about a Kidd/Parker/Manu backcourt and/or possibly trading Parker or Manu?

1628,633,Why is Lebron currently having the best RPM season on record?,"Apologies if the title is misleading, ESPN RPM only goes back to 2014 as far as I can tell, but Lebron is currently posting a ridiculous 10.25 RPM. Some other notable RPM numbers: Lebron in his last Miami season (9.08), Curry in his unanimous MVP season (8.59), and Giannis last year (6.69). 

Some other advanced stats paint a different picture, such as RAPTOR for this year giving Harden an equally absurd 9.1 WAR/+12.1 overall RAPTOR while Lebron comes in with a more pedestrian 6.1/+7.9. As far as PIPM, Giannis takes the cake there posting a 8.74 PIPM with Lebron having a 5.63 rating. The other advanced stats seem to follow with my eye test, that Harden and Giannis are the best players in the NBA this year, so one of the main questions then becomes, what is wrong with RPM?

Other questions: Is this a sample size issue? Is there some inherent error to RPM like the rebounding error in PER? Has Lebron just been THAT good?

I suspect the answer is the sample size, so if someone could point me to where I can find multi-year RPM that would be great.",nbadiscussion
1629,634,"If you could time travel to last year's offseason, would you rather have seen the Clippers kept their same team or made the PG trade/signed Kawhi?","After the Clippers, the team that I had been touting to win the championship since Kawhi signed with them,  blew a 3-1 lead to the Nuggets, I'm thinking back on last year and considering what could've been. There's no question that the Clippers will run it back this year, but especially since the Clips will have to make a tough decision on Harrell this offseason, their hopes are hinging on the team gelling more and having a more playoff-ready offensive game plan, so it's likely that we are going to see basically the same Clippers team that we saw this year unless Trez gets overpaid by somebody or the team fires Doc. 

With that being said, when the Clippers signed Kawhi, PG unexpectedly was traded to the team for a king's ransom and more (5 firsts, two potential pick swaps, Gallo's expiring, and Shai), seemingly as a combo deal with Kawhi joining the squad. If you could go back in time and take Michael Winger's (general manager, for those who are too lazy to do the Google detective work that I just did) spot on the team, would you have signed Kawhi and traded for PG, or would you have rather possibly A. sign a different FA (I remember [KD](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2837693-kevin-durant-2019-free-agency-odds-knicks-clippers-lead-warriors-as-favorites) and [Jimmy Butler](https://www.clipsnation.com/2019/6/27/18761283/nba-free-agency-rumors-jimmy-butler-kawhi-leonard-to-clippers-increasingly-possible) rumors being most prominent), B. run it back and let the young guys develop until you can maybe use that treasure chest of picks to acquire a different star that popped-up on the market, C. blow it up and tank alongside Shai (or do what the Thunder did this past year with their being good now and set-up well for the future), D. maybe still sign Kawhi and get Jimmy to be the co-star (this idea seems less plausible than the rest due to Jimmy's vocal love for Miami), or E. some other option that us fans either aren't aware existed or haven't thought about? The Clippers, similarly to the Nets in many ways actually (excluding the giving up assets part of acquiring their two stars), were both in a position last year where they could've gone in a million different directions, and sadly for Clips fans, they may have chosen the wrong one.

 I personally would've explored getting a Kawhi-Jimmy combo as my primary option with the knowledge that I have now, as I don't think any of KD, Kawhi, or Jimmy signs without a co-star, and if that wasn't possible, I would've gone into a semi-tank mode like the Thunder did and likely traded Gallo for a pick. I'm not faulting the Clippers' management for making the moves that they did last year, as everyone was very supportive of their decisions at the time, and they could still come back next year and win the championships, but it's fun to occasionally live in a fantasy world with our knowledge now.",nbadiscussion
1630,635,What are your way too early predictions for next season's Christmas Day games?,"Whether or not the season starts on Christmas next year, it's an important day for the NBA. There are 5 games on the day. What do you think will be the five games?

76ers at Celtics ESPN - Two major markets, two teams with popular players and large fanbases. Kind of a no brainer. Oh and if either team wins the east, they'll play on ABC instead of the Bucks.

Bucks at Nets ABC - This is predicated on the Bucks winning the East (or whatever the new format is). If not I imagine the Celtics will take this spot since they have a large fanbase. But if the Bucks do as they are expected to do as a one seed they'll get enough exposure to warrant the first ABC game. I think they'll play the Nets since they have Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, probably the two most well known players in the eastern conference (I think more Americans know Kyrie than Giannis)

Rockets at Mavericks ESPN - Luka and the Beard. Porzingas and Westbrook. Two playoff teams. Both of these teams will almost certainly play on Christmas Day and why not have a Texas twoway?

Lakers at Pelicans ABC - The second ABC slot is traditionally the most viewed game of Christmas as well as the most viewed regular season game of the year. This year has added significance since they'll be competing with the NFL. The NFL game is Vikings at Saints, which will take place less than mile from Smoothie King Center which is where I think this matchup will take place. Oh, and this matchup will feature LeBron vs Zion, not to mention Anthony Davis, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram. But LeBron vs Zion will be the key to this matchup and will be the key to getting people to choose this over the Kirk Cousins game.

Warriors at Clippers ESPN - while the Warriors sucked dick this year, they do have the second most popular NBA player in Steph Curry so they're a shoe in for a Christmas game. Clippers with Kawhi and Ballmer will for sure get a Christmas day game and I bet Staples will host it.

Some teams that are in contention for Christmas games are Raptors, Nuggets, Grizzlies, Bulls (big fanbase), Knicks (big fanbase)",nbadiscussion

1633,638,Improbably but possibly effective changes to the Game,"So, in a magical world where you could change anything to the sport of basketball with the goal of making it more consumable today via TV/Streaming/Twitter, what would be some really crazy possible stances you could make. I know people often talk about a 4 point shot, or 10 minute quarters, but those feel like bandaids to an inherent problem in the modern NBA. It just works out that, due to the high volume of chances to score in the NBA, there are larger chances for teams to come back from early deficits. This is only made more prevalent in the modern NBA which facilitates exciting scoring runs. So, I came up with something that I think would be amazingly exciting, easily broadcast-able, easily consumable via league pass or twitter, and vastly increases the enjoyment of watching a game start to finish.

What if we removed quarters, and played a basketball game like you play a tennis match.  Five sets 10 minutes long a piece.  Five minute TV Time Out between sets, 1 Team Timeout per set. First to win 3 sets wins the match.  This has a good number of positive attributes.

* There are climaxes through out a game. Multiple chances for last second heroics to win a set, which in the long run increases the excitement through out the match. Instead of tuning in for the last 5 minutes of a game, out of a two hour broadcast, you would probably want to catch the last 2 minutes of every set.
* Every set matters, so there is an importance put on every part of the game instead of just the fourth quarter
* You create strong advertising breaks that can be extended/shortened to fit national vs local broadcasts.
* You minimize the number of TV timeouts during real game play, minimizing the effect it has on the flow of the game.
* This helps to minimize the length of bad games, as good teams will blow out bad teams in 3 sets, saving them a possible extra 20 minutes a game.

Of course, there are negatives here:

* Makes for variable broadcast time
* Minimizes the in arena experience for bad teams as a match could run for as little as 40 minutes
* Minimizes the importance of role players/bench players in the regular season

So, what do you guys think. Its something that will NEVER happen, but I do find thinking about it to be pretty interesting.",nbadiscussion
1634,639,Introducing to you guys two of the Knicks more solid players that many don't know about,"When talking about the Knicks people always bring up our off season signings, RJ/Mitch/Knox/DSJ because they are our main core of young players, and Frank because he may or may not turn out to be a bust.

But there are two very solid players the Knicks have that nobody seems to know about. They are **Allonzo Trier** and **Damyean Dotson.** 

**Note**: I'm not saying these guys are going to be superstars by any means. They are very solid role players who can start if needed and be strong contributors off the bench. Allonzo Trier is a bit more gifted and has the offensive potential to be a 6moty candidate in the future.

Allonzo Trier was an undrafted rookie last season. In hindsight he'd probably go somewhere in the teens in a redraft. When saw him during summer league, as fans we didn't like him. He couldn't pass, he couldn't score well, he just didn't look good. Knicks gave him a 2 way contract and all of a sudden a switch flipped. Trier was taking players off the dribble and attacking super hard getting and 1's. He's a really talented offensive player who can take almost any defender off the dribble, blow past them, and finish strong at the rim. [Here's a highlight video of Trier's rookie year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRHDKINkCRQ). His herky jerky style of play and 3 level play are what make me give him the Lou Williams comparison. 

His weaknesses though are sometimes he can hog the ball. I believe in either high school or college this was a complaint that he got from his teammate. He's a very talent offensive scorer and it might get to his head a bit. Playmaking is another weakness but thats mainly due to his black hole nature. He can play point guard, has done it in HS and College but is mainly a SG. 

Damyean Dotson was drafted 44th in the 2017 draft. He easily outplayed his draft slot and would most likely go in the 20's in a redraft. His rookie season he was injured a lot and only played around 40ish games. Last year he greatly improved his entire game but still has a consistency issue. With Dotson he's either going to shoot 50% from 3 or 17%, theres no in between for him. While hes not super young at age 25, he still has room for growth due to him only being in the league for 2 years. He has gotten much stronger from his rookie to sophomore year which i believe helped alot with his shooting in his 2nd year. I expect him to shoot closer to 38, 39% from 3 this year with much improved defense and have around 13 ppg if he can get the minutes on this jammed Knicks team. He's not a lock down defender but he is above average. Teams were actually calling the Knicks about Dotson towards last years trade deadline and Knicks declined all trades. Dotson has tons of value as a role player or possible starter on some teams due to his ability to shoot and play defense. 

[Here is Damyean Dotson scoring 27 points, 8/13 from 3. Showcasing his off ball and catch and shoot game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUsFyp8SLQQ)

1638,643,"Based off the information we know now, what are some realistic ceilings, floors, and play styles for the top 3 picks in this years draft, Zion, Ja, and RJ?","**Zion**

Zion is the weird one obviously since the closest things we've seen to him is Charles Barkley. But i fee that Zion ceiling isn't as high as what the casual fans or media are making it out to be. They're saying that he'll be the next face of the NBA, this transcendental player, and i disagree. 

Zion is going to be good, but i see him more as a Blake Griffin tier player, this is not bad by any means. This is someone who can be a top 10 player in the NBA. But some things i feel that hold him back are his length and lack of perimeter play. Just like Ben Simmons and Giannis, Zion doesn't have the best perimeter game and that'll force teams to sag off of him and just guard the paint.  His length is also an issue as you saw in the Knicks vs Pelicans summer league game he got blocked around 4-5 times, 2-3 times in the paint by robinson, 1 time on the perimeter by robinson, and 1 time in the paint by Knox. We have to see how he adjusts to finishing against NBA bigs.

He's extremely strong and quick so transition scoring, rim running, and drawing fouls will be his forte, but unless he can get his perimeter scoring up, he wont be the player that the media is saying he'll be. He's also an under rated ball handler and passer. Due to the poor construction of Dukes team we did really see just how good of a ball handler he is, but i believe he's better than what the numbers say. 

Ceiling: If he develops that jump shot and avoids injury, top 3 player in the league, MVP candidate. Think Draymond Green with elite athleticism. 

Floor:  If he does not get that jumpshot going, top 18-23 player, high level defender, secondary playmaker, inside scorer. Think current Draymond Green

**Ja**

Ja Morant saw major improvements from his first to second year in college. Basically all counting stats and all major advance stats increased. His blazing quickness and elite athleticism allow him to get by almost any defender and his playmaking skills are ridiculous. I don't think people really talk about his play making or give him enough credit.

His jumpshot has improved and his free throw percentage is in the 80s so this is a good indication of NBA shooting. Overall he has the complete package. The worries are that the shooting doesn't translate over. That would make him heavily reliant on his athleticsm. Granted we seen guys like Derrick Rose get by but Rose is also one of the best finishers the NBA has ever seen. 

Ceiling: ~~If his shooting translates over he can be a top 10 player easily with his skill set. Think John Wall x DeAaron Fox blend.~~ **EDIT: Editing this as im typing it. I didn't talk much about his rebounding and totally forgot about it. I'll change my Ceiling to a top 7 player. Think of Russell Westbrook x DeAaron Fox**

Floor: If the shooting doesn't translate I think hes an all star (reserve not starter), top 25-30 guy. The athleticism and play making are still very good,  but not having the consistent jump shot can be a huge liability as teams can game plan and exploit that. Think early Jason Kidd minus the defense. 

**RJ**

Rj Barrett has the archtype of a Luka Doncic, James Harden, Manu Ginobli, Lamar Odom, kind of player. These guys are point forwards with high scoring ability (Odom wasn't a high scorer). The thing with RJ compared to the Zion and Ja is that hes a jack of all trades master of none kind of guy. He's not elite in any part of the game. Zion has his strength and athleticism, Ja has his passing and athleticism, RJ is good at almost everything just not elite at one thing. 

But this can be a positive for RJ as if he can develop well he can be a top 5 player and someone who can consistently drop triple doubles or close to it. Just to show what i mean, when Tre Jones went down, RJ Barrett became the main ball handler on Duke. The first game RJ dropped 23points 9 assists 16 rebounds. He dropped either double digit assists or rebounds 9 times in college, dropping 1 triple double, and many times came close to having another. 

With RJ, his ceiling very high but his floor can be very low. 

Ceiling: If he can become a become that triple double threat while shooting a respectable clip from 3, he can be an MVP candidate, top 5 player. Think James Hardenish. Although James Harden always had better shooting potential than RJ, i think this is as close as an elite comp as i can find. 

Floor: If his shooting doesn't translate. and cannot become a play maker he can bottom out at just a high level starter starter. Someone who can give you inefficient points, some rebounds, some assists, but nothing special. 

If i were to rank them on different categories i'd say

Shooting: Ja > RJ > Zion

Shot Creation: Ja = RJ > Zion

Finishing: Zion > Ja > RJ

Defense: Zion > RJ > Ja

Playmaking: Ja > RJ > Zion

Rebounding: Zion > RJ = Ja

Ball Handling: Ja > RJ > Zion

Post Scoring: Zion > RJ > Ja",nbadiscussion
1639,644,Is this a better way to classify players instead of traditional PG-SG-SF-PF-C,"I feel like there's too much confusion over positions now a days. Like some people classify Harden as a PG while other classify as a SG. Same with Giannis. He plays PF but is much different than players like Blake Griffin.  Here's how I'd classfy players.

Guards: PGs or SGs who have primary playmaking responsibilities (Harden, Booker and Mitchell this year)

Wings: Play SG-PF but can alternate between these positions. If SG, don't ever play PG and can play SF (Klay, Danny Green, Middleton). SF-PF examples: (Giannis, KD, Lebron, PG, Kawhi, etc.)

Bigs: PF-C, but don't or can't play SF. (AD, Embiid, Jokic, Blake Griffin, Draymond, etc.)",nbadiscussion

**#Some terms#**

**per 75** = per 75 possessions, i.e. **points per 75 possessions** = measure of a player's **scoring rate**, an alternative to PPG. Each team plays at a different pace (and the league as a whole plays slightly faster or slower each season), so **adjusting for pace** like this allows us to compare players' scoring more fairly than PPG will. (**Question: Why 75 possessions?**  - **Answer:** The average high-usage modern NBA player simply uses roughly 75 possessions/game, so ""per 75"" stats are perhaps easier to intuitively understand for most people than ""per 100"" stats, which are available on Basketball Reference.)

**TS%** = true shooting percentage, i.e. a player's scoring efficiency, basically FG%, but accounting for 3-pointers and free-throws

**rTS%** = relative TS%, i.e. how efficient a player's scoring is compared to league average scoring efficiency, which is 56.4 TS% in 2019-20 according to Basketball Reference
 
**ORTG** and **DRTG** are a team's offensive and defensive rating, respectively, with numbers taken from Basketball Reference.

**rORTG/rDRTG** = relative ORTG or DRTG, i.e. how good a team's offense is compared to league average offensive and defensive rating, which are 110.4 in 2019-20 according to Basketball Reference

- **#3: That Bron-Brow thing**

Borrowing this quote from my ""unicorns"" [post](https://tinyurl.com/ycw8mzco) featuring Anthony Davis a while back,

>**Vertical spacer:** AD is arguably the [**GOAT lob-finisher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDrxk64UTPU) (75 FG% from 0-3 feet). Davis's catch-radius is one of the best in NBA history. Just throw it up in the general direction of the rim and he'll make it work somehow with his touch and athleticism. **His addition to the Lakers is a major reason why LeBron's leading the league in assists (2.8 of LeBron's 10.6 assists/game go to AD).** 

The Lakers' chemistry this season has been fabulous, with the team exceeding all expectations and leading the West. At the head of the team, the **LeBron-AD connection**, in particular, has been even better that people probably imagined coming into the season--- **of all 2-man assist-combos in the league this year,** [**James to Davis ranks 1st by a vast margin**](https://www.pbpstats.com/assist-combo-summary/nba?Season=2019-20&SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason), with 172 assists between the two leading the league, far ahead of Lillard-Whiteside with 130 and Lou-Trez with 127. 

LeBron hits AD in a variety of ways: in the pick-and-roll, with lobs and snappy interior dishes; pick-and-pop or drive-and-kick, with AD positioned in the midrange or out on the 3-point line; simply dumping it to AD in the post and letting him go to work; [**hitting AD quickly and accurately in transition as part of a new-age ""Showtime""**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdr3h7YvkSE&t=35s) ; in semi-transition, or off made-field goals, LeBron lets AD leak out early in the shot clock to establish good post position quickly, and then hits him with a long-range outlet pass so that AD can ISO against an unprepared defense. The Lakers often get 1-2 buckets per game in this fashion alone.

- **#4: Mitchell Robinson, making history**

(By Popular Demand!)

The Knicks' young shot-eraser averaged 10 points, 7 rebounds, and 2 blocks on **historic, league-leading, 74.2 FG%** (alongside also-league-leading 74.2 eFG% and 72.6 TS%). It's the first figure we're concerned about here, as [**Robinson has potentially beaten Wilt Chamberlain's single-season FG% record of 72.7 FG%**](https://dailyknicks.com/2020/06/04/new-york-knicks-mitchell-robinson-fg-record/), set in 1972-73.

The biggest hurdle standing in the way of Mitchell's record being officially ratified by the NBA is, unfortunately, COVID-19. 

>The nba.com website provides a glossary of statistical minimums to qualify as a league-leader in any particular category. **Under the assumption of an 82-game season, a player would need to make 300 field goals to qualify as the league leader in FG%. Through 66 games, Mitch made 253 field goals. In the absence of a shortened season, Mitch would be 47 made baskets short of qualifying as the league leader.**

>What muddies the question even further is that most teams will end the 2019-20 season playing an uneven number of games. NBA teams played anywhere from 64-67 games at the time of the shutdown.

>The league needs to determine the number of games that will become the baseline for qualifying as a league leader in any statistical category. Will the league go with the higher threshold (72-75 games) or will the league consider that nearly a 1/3 of the league played a shorter schedule (64-67 games)?

>Through 64 games – the fewest number of games played by an NBA team – a qualifying player would need to play in 45 games and make a minimum of 235 field goals to qualify as a league leader in FG%. **Mitch would qualify based on a 64-game schedule. Additionally, Mitch would breakeven and qualify even if the NBA increased the qualifying games from 64 to 69.**

>**However, if the NBA determines eligibility based on a 72-game schedule, a qualifying player would need to make 264 field goals to become the league leader in FG%, leaving Mitch 11 field goals short or breaking Wilt’s record.**

Soooo, yeah. C'mon Adam Silver, do your thing. Let the Knicks fans have this.

- **#5: Brandon Ingram's historic single-season shooting improvement**

It often takes NBA players multiple years to rewrite flawed shot mechanics, and improvement likely won't be linear. LeBron, for example, took a solid 6-7 seasons to develop a reliable jumper, and his free throw shooting remains inconsistent to this day.

Sometimes, though, very rarely, players can show unprecedented jumps in shooting improvement (both free-throw and 3-point shooting) over the course of 1 or 2 seasons. 

A good example of this is Pascal Siakam:

Season | 3PA | 3P% | FTA | FT%
---|---|----|----|----
2017-18| 1.6| 22.0%| 1.1 | 62.1
2018-19 | 2.7 | 36.9%| 3.8 | 78.5
2019-20 | 6.0| 35.9% | 5.2 | 80.0

Within 2 seasons, Spicy P has gone from a terrible 3-point shooter who barely took any 3s, to a consistent on-ball and off-ball threat from 3 this season, pulling up this season from deep with impunity. Similarly, he went from a horrendous free-throw shooter in 2018 to shooting above-average from the line on a significantly higher number of attempts. This is wonderful improvement from Pascal, in both free-throw *and* 3-point shooting, which is something we've rarely seen - FT% generally remains pretty stable over a player's career.

Now, while this is very cool, how is it relevant to Ingram? Well, what Ingram has done in 2019-20 is reproduce what Siakam did over the course of two seasons, **within a single season**, to an even higher degree:

Season | 3PA | 3P% | FTA | FT%
---|---|----|----|----
2018-19 | 1.8 | 33.0%| 5.6 | 67.5
2019-20 | **6.3**| **38.7%** | **5.9** | **85.8**

Within one season, Ingram:

- - **Almost quadrupled his 3-point volume**, **and went from a below-average to elite 3-point threat** in terms of 3P%, jumping 3 percentage points from 33% to 39%, all while --- hold my drink here--- *taking much much harder threes*:  pull-up 3s, 3s off PnR and PnP, 3s around screens, stepbacks, deep threes, contested 3s, 3s off handoffs. 


- - (Perhaps even more incredibly) Completely reworked his jumper to the point that his **FT% improved by almost 20 percentage points**. ***Twenty***. Like, what?! And this isn't a fluke or low-sample-size improvement, either - he's taking almost 6 free throws a game!

These are ***staggering*** improvements. 

Now, some Lakers fans are certain to chime in at this point that Ingram, in fact, shot 39% from 3 in his sophomore season, in 2017-18!

However, that season, he only shot **68% from the line**, which, combined with his very low 3P volume (**only 1.8 3PA**), suggests that this season was more of a fluke. This is supported by the fact that his FT% and 3PA remained pretty unchanged in the following season (2018-19).

No, what Ingram's accomplished this season is pretty much completely unheard-of. [Simply watching him shoot this season is a different experience altogether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1IQ9CduGQU&t=2m53s): ""His motion is faster and more efficient now, he's no longer releasing this near the top of his jump, and so he doesn't pause the ball back at his right ear. The whole thing's just smoother now.""

The credit for this unlikely improvement should go to Brandon *and* **New Orleans's awesome assistant coach slash shot-doctor Fred Vinson**, who [worked very closely with both Ingram and Lonzo Ball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1PD5m_KOXo) this offseason, and allowed [both of them to experience massive single-season shooting improvements](https://tinyurl.com/y7afzmwo).

- **#6: Luka Dončić, the rightful 2019-20 Most Improved Player?** 

For some reason, it's seemingly become almost taboo amongst voters to include sophomore players in MIP voting discussions. Perhaps this is due to rookies being *supposed* to struggle, especially on defense, as part of ""hitting the rookie wall"", hence leading to their improvements in their sophomore years being almost *expected*, and nothing to write home about.

There's some validity to this idea, of course. A recent notable example is Sacramento Kings lottery pick DeAaron Fox, who struggled in his rookie year before exploding in his sophomore season (last year) as a top young point guard in the West.

However, those assumptions simply don't make sense for Dončić. 

For one thing, Luka was the runaway Rookie of the Year. He averaged 21.2/7.8/6.0 as the number one option on a decent Mavericks side, and was even a fringe-mention in All-Star discussions. He was incredibly clutch, too. If there were any 'rookie struggles', Luka basically sidestepped them all.

Furthermore, and more importantly, Dončić has just had [perhaps the greatest sophomore season in NBA history.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8RhyUzW3t0)

In the span of one season , Luka's gone from a sub-All Star to an undisputed top 5-10 player. With all due respect to Brandon Ingram, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo, Pascal Siakam, Devonte' Graham, or any other MIP candidate who is out there, Luka's improvement this season **across the board** trumps them all. Compared to his rookie year, he's scoring much more often, more efficiently, facilitating more, facilitating more efficiently, rebounding more, leading a much more efficient offense, and just has a much higher impact on the court overall:

**To finish this section off,** I thought I'd conclude with an excellent excerpt from [**The Ringer's Dan Devine, who wrote up a superb article on who he thinks deserves to win Most Improved Player**](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/3/26/21194914/nba-most-improved-luka-doncic-bam-adebayo-jayson-tatum) (featuring Dončić, Adebayo, Ingram, and Tatum):

>*Ultimately, I came back to what I felt after the first quarter of the season: As impressive and valid as all the other brands of improvement are, and as difficult as all of those leaps are to make, there’s nothing more impressive or difficult than becoming a top-five player in the league. While I wound up leaving Doncic [just outside my top five in MVP balloting](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/3/23/21190427/nba-awards-mvp-giannis-antetokounmpo-lebron-james), it was by the slimmest of margins; he’s fucking unreal, in a way that even the heady early days of “Halleluka” hype didn’t quite project.*


>*This season, Doncic became just the [fifth player ever](http://bkref.com/tiny/f9tfQ) to average 28 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists per game, joining Oscar Robertson, James Harden, Michael Jordan, and Russell Westbrook. He led not only this season’s no. 1 offense, but* [*statistically the no. 1 NBA offense* ***ever***](http://bkref.com/tiny/XfHsm), *and did it while combining usage and scoring efficiency to a degree matched only by Harden and Giannis*.

>...*as [John Hollinger noted at The Athletic](https://theathletic.com/1639718/2020/02/28/how-finished-product-luka-doncic-has-improved-more-than-any-2018-draftee/?source=weeklyemail), Doncic has also worked diligently to improve his left hand, opening up angles that defenses used to be able to close off to attack, probe, pass, and shoot. Now, the whole floor is unlocked, and opponents have to fear Doncic picking them apart from all over the court.*

>*No player in the league made a bigger or more significant leap this season than Doncic. He returned Dallas to playoff contention, teaming with Kristaps Porzingis, sideline genius Rick Carlisle, and a deep roster of complementary role players to create an offensive juggernaut—one that promises to get even scarier as Doncic continues to work on his jumper. If Luka and the Mavericks offense are already this good while he shoots 31.8 percent from 3, what fresh hell can they unleash if he follows in Harden’s footsteps and gets up to 35 or 36, or even higher?*

- **#9: Ben Simmons, good at defense**

 This season, Ben Simmons has graduated a level on defense, becoming, [as The Ringer's Rob Mahoney succinctly summarised in an excellent article](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/1/13/21063252/ben-simmons-philadelphia-76ers-defense), ""**one of the NBA’s very best defenders, full stop and without caveat.""** 

In the Sixers' 6th-ranked defensive scheme (-2.2 rDRTG), Josh Richardson marks the speediest guards, while Horford and Embiid share the responsibility of walling off the rim and guarding opponent bigs. Simmons, meanwhile, is in charge of just about everyone else. 

Krishna Narsu's [**Defensive Versatility Index**](https://apanalytics.shinyapps.io/knarsu3/) ranks players by time spent guarding all 5 positions. Among players who've guarded at least 1500 possessions, [Simmons ranks **6th** in the league](https://i.imgur.com/DVUdHmS.png), notably guarding each of the guard and forward positions at least 18% of the time. He guards everyone from Bradley Beal and James Harden, to Aaron Gordon and Pascal Siakam.

Simmons moves his feet with the fluidity of a guard but also has the bulk and length of a big (6-10 and 240 pounds with a 7ft wingspan), able to shadow slippery jitterbugs around screens and have the footwork and IQ to deny Luka and Harden their stepbacks, but also able to bang with behemoths in the post.

Of course, no discussion of Simmons's defense would be complete without mentioning his [**hustle**](https://stats.nba.com/players/hustle-leaders/). Ben ranks 1st in **steals**/game (2.1), 3rd in **deflections**/game (4.0), and 2 in **loose balls recovered**/game (1.7). Though he hasn't offered too much in the way of rim protection this year (0.6 blks/G), Simmons is tremendously disruptive off the ball, constantly poking players' dribbles away from behind, reading passes before they happen, harassing ball-handlers, denying handoffs, ambushing passing lanes, and battling for rebounds (7.8 rebs/game, him and Embiid have helped the 6ers to the 2nd-best DRB% in the league).

Joel Embiid is still the most impactful defender on the team - the Sixers' defensive rating is **6.7** points better when he's on the court - but with him missing *21* games this season, it's been up to veteran defensive big Horford, and crucially, Simmons, to plug in the gaps, play multiple positions, and help maintain a passable team defense in JoJo's absence.

In this golden age of 3-point shooting, the historically-revered but objectively less efficient midrange shot (~ 40 FG% on average) has been largely eschewed from the league as a viable shot for the average NBA player. 

For high scoring players, though, it remains a key component of the offensive arsenals of many stars - the ability to make these shots when defenses give them up in clutch situations or in the playoffs has been often discussed among fans and analysts. 

.

This season, the [**5 most efficient midrange scorers**](https://stats.nba.com/players/shooting/?Season=2019-20&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&DistanceRange=By%20Zone&PerMode=Totals&sort=Mid-Range%20FG%20PCT&dir=1&CF=Mid-Range%20FGA*G*100) (minimum 100 midrange shots attempted)  have been: 

**5.** Damian Lillard's sharpshooting Portland running-mate *CJ McCollum* (*49.3 FG%*), 

**4.** ""50-40-90 club"" inductee *Malcolm Brogdon* (*50.6 FG%*), 

**3.** Cleveland's veteran star power-forward *Kevin Love* (*52.0 FG%*), 

**2.** Milwaukee Bucks All-Star *Khris Middleton* (*52.3 FG%*), who's had an excellent season co-starring alongside likely-MVP Giannis leading Milwaukee to a historing winning pace, and is a literal hair away from ""50-40-90 club"" induction himself this year (49.9/41.8/90.8 splits), 

**1.** and finally, last but certainly not least, with an incredible bounce-back season in Oklahoma at age 34, ***Chris Paul***, who shot a scorching ***53.9 FG%*** from his favourite zone on the court.

The [**5 least efficient midrange shooters**](https://stats.nba.com/players/shooting/?Season=2019-20&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&DistanceRange=By%20Zone&PerMode=Totals&sort=Mid-Range%20FG%20PCT&dir=-1&CF=Mid-Range%20FGA*G*100)  are a fun and varied bunch as well (these dudes should really be taking fewer of these particular shots): 

**5.** brand-new Golden State Warriors employee *Andrew Wiggins* (*33.8 FG%*), 

**4.** Chicago's promising young rookie guard *Coby White* (*33.6 FG%*), 

**3.** the defending champion Raptors' newly minted All-Star *Pascal Siakam* (*32.1 FG%*), 

**2.** a fellow All-Star who's perhaps finally found his perfect home in Miami and has had an excellent season overall, *Jimmy Butler* (*31.0 FG%*),

**1.** and finally, last and most certainly least, shooting a putrid ***25.4 FG%*** from the midrange: full-time rapper, part-time Slam Dunk Contest runner-up, the Orlando Magic's do-everything-except-shooting-quite-well Power Forward... ***Aaron Gordon***. 

.

Now, efficiency is all nice and dandy, but you might be wondering at this point - who's actually *taking* the most midrange shots in the league? Most of these names will likely be some familiar to fans as well-seasoned practitioners of the midrange - the [**5 most prolific midrange shot-takers**](https://stats.nba.com/players/shooting/?Season=2019-20&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&DistanceRange=By%20Zone&PerMode=Totals&sort=Mid-Range%20FGA&dir=1&CF=Mid-Range%20FGA*G*100) in the league in 2020:

**5.** *CJ McCollum (280 attempts, 49.3 FG%)*, who we've mentioned previously, 

**4.** defending Finals MVP *Kawhi Leonard (282 attempts, 44.0 FG%)*, who led the nation of Canada to their maiden title last year with the midrange fadeaway as a trusty and now iconic weapon in his arsenal (*cries in Sixers*),

**3.** the newest entry in the top three (he was 15th last season), Phoenix's 1st-time All-Star *Devin Booker (288 attempts, 44.4 FG%)*, who's had an excellent offensive campaign (25.7 points and 6.5 assists per 75 on awesome +5.3 efficiency) leading the oft-maligned Suns to a league average offense,

**2.** the guy who replaced Kawhi Leonard on the Spurs, fellow midrange enthusiast *DeMar DeRozan (331 attempts, 44.7 FG%)*, whose game is now synonymous (to a slightly unhealthy degree) with his love for the midrange,

**1.** and finally, DeMar's fellow San Antonio running-mate and stretch big ***LaMarcus Aldridge (352 attempts, 44.9 FG%)***. Fun-fact: these two finished 1st and 2nd in [last year's list](https://stats.nba.com/players/shooting/?Season=2018-19&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&DistanceRange=By%20Zone&PerMode=Totals&sort=Mid-Range%20FGA&dir=1&CF=Mid-Range%20FGA*G*100) as well.

- **#11: Yo speaking of DeMar... what's he been up to recently?**

We've always known him as Toronto's beloved All-Star guard who shares Ben Simmons's aversion to the 3-point shot, but since the fateful 2018 Kawhi Leonard trade that sent him to San Antonio, DeMar DeRozan has faded from the spotlight somewhat as the Spurs now face an annual struggle to make the playoffs in a brutal Western Conference. **So, how's he been faring in his second year donning the black and silver?**

- - The first thing you probably notice about 2020 DeMar DeRozan is that this is easily the ***most efficient version*** of him we've ever seen - he's averaged **23.3 points and 5.9 assists per 75** on 53% shooting from the field and **60 TS%**, 3.3 points higher than league-average efficiency (i.e. **+3.3 rTS%**). His previous most efficient volume-scoring output was in 2015-16, where he scored 25.3 points per 75 on +0.9 efficiency (55 TS%). DeMar's shooting percentage at the rim has been incredible for his position - **[70.7 FG% in the restricted area](https://stats.nba.com/player/201942/shooting/)**, which is similar at-rim efficiency to someone like LeBron James (69 FG%) or Anthony Davis (73 FG%) - on far fewer attempts, of course, but still highly impressive.

- - The second thing you might is that ***this season has been a tale of two DeMars***. Including and prior to 12-22-2019, a 25-point loss to the Clippers, DeRozan averaged 20.7 points and 4.7 assists on 56 TS% (-0.4 rTS%). *Since that date, over 33 games, he's averaged 23.4 points and 6.3 assists on blistering hot efficiency, 55/27/87 splits, or 63 TS% (+6.3 rTS%)*. As a result, DeMar DeRozan now holds the record for the [**longest streak of 20+ points and >50 FG% by guards in NBA history**](https://tinyurl.com/ybr9zxo7). Cool stuff! 

- - This wasn't a random change, though. [Coach Pop made two key changes after that horrific Clippers loss](https://www.spurstalk.com/demar-derozan-san-antonio-spurs-cracked-code/). First, he **moved DeMar to Power Forward**, to reduce Rudy Gay's playing time and veer away from having LaMarcus Aldridge and non-shooting center Jakob Poeltl share the court, to try and improve spacing. Second, he **moved LMA to the 3-point line and implored LMA to shart shooting 3s.** The effect was near-instantaneous - all of a sudden, with LMA bombing away from 3 (4.2 3PA, 42 3P% in 23 games since 12/23/19), DeRozan has had more driving lanes to work with, abusing more mismatches and drawing more fouls (5.8->7.3 FTA/G), having more midrange real-estate to find clearer looks and also finishing more cleanly at the rim (49.9->55.0 FG%), and attracting more defensive attention as a result to facilitate the Spurs offense (4.7->6.3). 

- - The third thing you might realize is that ***DeMar is still a very poor defender***. The Spurs are a [**whopping 5.9 points better on defense with DeMar off the court**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/derozde01/on-off/2020), and most available defensive metrics available all paint DeMar as a bottom 10th-15th percentile defender - D-PIPM (17th-worst), D-RAPM (449th), D-RAPTOR (226th out of 250), D-RPM (469th). He consistently ranks near the bottom of the league in [hustle stats](https://stats.nba.com/players/hustle/?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*DeMar%20DeRozan&Season=2019-20&SeasonType=Regular%20Season), is terrible at fighting over screens, is a non-factor in transition defense (he has a penchant for complaining for missed calls), is inconsistent in closing out to shooters, strikes out when gambling for steals, has questionable decision-making and often finds himself a step or two behind opponent plays, stuck in no-mans-land, making him a poor team defender. He's not terrible at man defense, and the move to power forward [actually helped his defense somewhat](http://www.82games.com/1920/19SAS9.HTM#bypos), as opponent PFs only have a 15.1 PER (around league average) when facing DeRozan, whereas opponent SFs have an excellent 19.7 PER with DeMar as the primary defender. Not all of San Antonio's defensive woes can be attributed to DeMar. The team is in a constant state of defensive flux - a dearth of shooting forces Popovich to often play proven floor-spacer but *absolute defensive sieve Bryn Forbes*, while inconsistent shooting and offensive production limit the Spurs' best all-round defender, Dejounte Murray's, court time, and a lack of spacing also stops excellent rim protector Jakob Poeltl from earning consistent minutes as lineups pairing him and LMA have been awful on offense. 

- - The fourth and final thing, perhaps, is that the ***situation in San Antonio is very tenuous*** for both DeMar and the team alike. The Spurs are currently stuck between eras, trying to churn out winning seasons and maintain their streak of 22 consecutive playoff appearances by playing veterans like DeMar, LMA, and Gay large minutes while simultaneously trying to develop younger promising players like Murray, White, Lonnie Walker, Lyles, and Poeltl. This has yielded mixed results this season because of a lack of spacing and inconsistent defense. Meanwhile, DeMar is on the wrong side of 30 and has a possible contract extension looming ($150M, 4 years, if I'm not mistaken). Some say he'll leave, some say a potential cap-drop resulting from COVID-19 could convince him to opt-in. Either way, this season is a turning point for the team and for DeMar.

- **#12: The Memphis Grizzlies' Funky Big Trio**

Three of Memphis's four best players might be bigs, with **Jonas Valančiūnas** (28 y/o), **Jaren Jackson Jr.** (20 y/o), and **Brandon Clarke** (23 y/o) hoping to continue the Grizzlies' tradition of producing elite bigs like ZBo and Marc Gasol. What makes these 3 so fun is in how different they all are, and yet so effective in their roles. Valančiūnas (15/11/2 on +6.7 rTS%) is an old-school low-post monster, slow and methodical with his back to the basket, an elite rebounder, and brutally effective against teams with undersized bigs. To loosely quote Zach Lowe, I really enjoy watching Grizzlies unleash JV every 2 or 3 games to mash teams with below average rim protection. He is solid in his defensive role in the Grizzlies drop coverage and can move his feet decently, but is vulnerable against strong pick-and-pop and pick-and-roll teams (e.g. Blazers, Wolves, Mavs). [Jaren Jackson Jr](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/1/15/21065775/jaren-jackson-jr-highlights-memphis-grizzlies-stats-video-unicorn) (17/5/1.5 on +2.6 rTS%), meanwhile, is easily the 2nd most important offensive piece on the team, mainly due to his elite floor-spacing - he's frighteningly adept at his role, hitting 40% of his 6 to 7 3 point attempts per game, making these off-the-dribble, pick-and-pop, as stepbacks, traditional catch-and-shoot, inverted PnR, or even the odd hail mary yeet the moment he crosses half-court, the whole package. He also remains adept at the rim, scoring 70 FG% from 0-3 feet. He has yet to fulfil his defensive potential, however, held back by fouling concerns. Brandon Clarke (12/6/1.5 on +10.6 rTS%) is perhaps the best value-for-money pick in the draft, selected as no. 21 but all but guaranteed to make an All-Rookie team. His skillset has transferred shockingly well to the NBA, as a crazy-efficient scorer, athletic rebounder, and being able to defend just about every position on the court. [Clarke](https://stats.nba.com/player/1629634/shooting/) is money at the rim (74.4 FG% in the restricted area) with dunks, alley-oops, finger-rolls, and tip-ins; he has a gorgeous floater which he unleashes further away in the paint (elite 56.8 FG% in the non-restricted area of the paint); and he's capable of knocking down the odd open above-the-break 3 (43.3 FG%) on very low volume (30 3PA). Both he and Jaren have highly varied and scale-able skillsets that mesh with a variety of teammates and lineup types. The Grizzlies' future is bright.

- **#13: Marcus Smart vs Terry Rozier, as 3 point shooters**

These two players, former teammates during their fairytale run to the conference finals in 2018, are now very different players on very different teams - Scary Terry has had himself a decent season at Charlotte as a primary scorer/secondary playmaker (18/4/4 on 55 TS%), while Smart is a defensively-elite [""stretch-6""](https://clutchpoints.com/celtics-news-marcus-smart-calls-his-position-a-stretch-6/) in Boston as a key contributor on both ends and part-time PG. However, what I'm interested in today is the ways these two players contrast in terms of 3-point shooting. 

This season, Rozier has hit an elite 41% of his 6.7 3PA while Smart has connected on a decent 35% of his 6.9 3PA. To be more precise, Terry Rozier is one of the league's best **catch-and-shoot** players, hitting an incredible [**45.7%**](https://stats.nba.com/player/1626179/shots-dash/) of his catch-and-shoot 3s, with a more pedestrian 34% on his pullup 3s. 

On the other hand, Marcus Smart is one of the league's best **pull-up** shooters, hitting an elite [**40.4%**](https://stats.nba.com/player/203935/shots-dash/) of his pull-up 3s, but a horrendous 31.4% on catch-and-shoot 3s. A fun contrast!",nbadiscussion

1646,651,Chris Paul Stays In New York To Discuss NBA Changes With Union,"From Forbes Sports Money https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissheridan/2020/01/08/chris--paul-stays-in-new-york-to-discuss-nba-changes-with-union/?utm_source=TWITTER&utm_medium=social&utm_content=3027994675&utm_campaign=sprinklrSportsMoneyTwitter#5811f1c91e7b

Chris Paul did not fly back to Oklahoma City with his teammates Tuesday night after he practically defeated the Brooklyn Nets all by himself. Instead, he stayed in town for a meeting with NBA Players Association officials to discuss proposed changes to the playoff landscape.

If approved, the 82-game schedule could be a thing of the past.

And you know that time-tested thing where NBA teams play 82 games to determine who goes to the playoffs? That could be a thing of the past, too, if what NBA commissioner Adam Silver is proposing is accepted by the players.

In an exclusive interview, Paul — the president of the players’ union — was very much the diplomat.

“That’s the thing about our league: We’re at least brainstorming and trying to find a way to make it entertaining.

“But at the end of the day, it’s still entertainment,” Paul said.

For an old-school faction of the NBA’s audience, changing something that isn’t broken makes little practical sense.

Under Silver’s proposal, there would be two major adjustments: A play-in tournament for the seventh and eighth seeds, and an in-season tournament that would be held in November or December and would keep some players and teams from playing an 82-game schedule.

Most NBA records are based upon an 82-game schedule, and there are some who feel the record book would be compromised by changing that number to 78 or 79.

“But they haven’t always played 82 games, either, and everything is a conversation. Nothing has been finalized,” Paul said. “Luckily there are a lot of people who have been in the business, and hopefully the right decisions are made.”

ESPN Reported earlier in the day that the NBA is seriously reconsidering the idea of reseeding the four conference finalists. A proposal that was floated called for reseeding, which could have brought an end to the top team in the East playing the top team from the West.

The NBA’s coastal teams have been largely against this reseeding idea, the report said, and research has shown that the proposal of reseeding teams based on regular season records could lead to travel increases of 60% and could result in one in one out of every four series being played across three time zones.

The NBA’s Board of Governors is expected to vote on the changes in April, but the players’ okay is needed in order to make such significant changes to the $8 billion per year business.

Paul takes the temperature of different players every time he travels with the Oklahoma City Thunder, and Wednesday’s meeting at union headquarters in Manhattan should bring some clarity to the union’s position.

For now, Paul is non-committal as to where he and the union stand.

“Nothing is set in stone, and we’ll figure it out,” Paul said. “Personally, this isn’t my company. We’re a league and a union, and we’re going to figure it out.”",nbadiscussion
1647,652,How much value can high rebounding guards possess?,"I’m a huge spurs fan, and naturally one of my favorite players is Dejounte Murray, a point guard who is arguably one of the best rebounders at his position. 

Guys like Murray, Westbrook, Jrue, and to a lesser extent Lowry are all guys who definitely play the 1 position and tend to inhale a lot of rebounds. 

What is the value that these rebounds can have on the court? 

Surely there must be some spacing/positional trade offs that have to take place for guards to get these rebounds, If so, what are they?",nbadiscussion

1650,655,OKC-MIN-ORL Westbrook trade?,"Am I crazy? Please let me know, I'm certainly not as knowledgeable about cap minutia and trade scenarios as many of you guys.

**Trade Details**

MIN sends: Jeff Teague, Andrew Wiggins, Gorgui Dieng, Josh Okogie, 2020 1st, 2022 1st (Top 4 protected), 2020 2nd 

MIN receives: Russell Westbrook, DJ Augustin, Andre Roberson

&#x200B;

OKC sends: Russell Westbrook, Andre Roberson, Terrance Ferguson, 2020 2nd

OKC receives: Andrew Wiggins, Gorgui Dieng, Markelle Fultz, Josh Okogie, 2020 1st from MIN, 2022 1st from MIN

&#x200B;

ORL sends: Markelle Fultz, DJ Augustin

ORL receives: Jeff Teague, Terrance Ferguson, 2020 2nd from MIN, 2020 2nd from OKC

&#x200B;

**Why MIN does it**

They essentially trade bad salary (Wiggins, Dieng) for other bad salary (Westbrook) but get a significant talent upgrade, especially for a team that has few other ways to get a player of WB's caliber. Deadly PnR with Russ/Towns, especially when Towns pops and teams have to decide between a Towns 3 and a WB drive. WB has plenty of issues but he is a spectacular passer, and if he has Towns at the 5 instead of Adams, it could be dynamite on offense. Augustin is a better fit beside WB or 6th man as a reliable spot up shooter and mistake-free floor general. Roberson will also get plenty of run and will guard the star guards MIN will face. The price they pay for this talent upgrade is two of their own 1sts, which I would project as landing in the 10-20 range.

**Why OKC does it**

Presti loves guys with physical talent and potential, and he gets 3 of them here. OKC will be a great home for the Wiggins reclamation project, and at worst he will be a fantastic tank commander that will help OKC's own picks gain value. Fultz is a project, but all hope is not lost, while Okogie has the makings of a solid contributor with some upside. Mostly, this helps quicken OKC's rebuild and they add to their war chest of picks with MIN's 2 first rounders, of which 2022 does have some upside of being in 5-10 range with the potential of WB declining to nothing/Towns getting traded or both.

**Why ORL does it**

Teague can be a moderate upgrade at PG with his offensive creation ability and if things don't work out, they can explore deals for him at the deadline (only 1 year left on his deal, should be moveable). Ferguson shores up some minutes that Fultz might have played. They fill in the gaps in this trade, and get 1 pick for making the math work and the juicy OKC 2nd for Fultz, whose value has plummeted.",nbadiscussion
1651,656,Why is the mainstream sports media treating the Lakers success as a foregone conclusion?,"I feel like the media has completely stopped doing real analysis when it comes to the Lakers.  

When most teams add a big piece, they’ll talk about the fit, the play style, schemes, etc. and how it will work.
 
For example, Chris Paul to Houston. The media did nothing but criticize the ball-dominance of them both and talked about the fit non-stop. 

Another example is Jimmy Butler to the Sixers. They ranted about the fit and play styles all day long. 

Kevin Love going to Cleveland is another one. The list goes on and on. 

But I haven’t seen that been analyzed once on the main programs with LeBron and AD. Nobody has thought about the fact that LeBron and big men in the past haven’t meshed exceptionally well. Chris Bosh was basically turned into a 3 point shooter and same with Kevin Love. If they didn’t have a perimeter shot, they’d have been almost useless with LeBron. 

Now, I know AD is a scorer and can develop an improving outside shot, but his MO is dominating the inside with his athleticism on both ends. If he turns into Chris Bosh 2.0 he won’t be producing at the MVP level that they expect. When you combine that with LeBron entering his 17th season in the NBA.... why is it not even reasonable to mention it *might* not be the best team in the world. 

Now, I know the responses are going to explain why the Lakers will be a good fit and how it will work out, and that’s entirely possible. But that’s the point, I want to see the media actually analyze how they are going to work together instead of just saying “LeBron and AD, duh”.

That being said, why are teams not offering older players frontloaded contracts, which would reflect their progressive value more accurately? I understand it's quite inhumane to refer to older players as depreciating assets and it's certainly terse to communicate to players that they are worth less by the end of their contract than more, but in the NBA market that is what they are. I feel as though teams would prefer older players to be on depreciating deals and that would make the player more flexible to be moved be it at the behest of the team or the player's request.

A lot of people claimed that this was due to changes in defensive rules and statflation so offenses like the 2003-04 Mavericks who beat the league average by a wider variation under tougher defensive rules that allowed both zone and hand checking were ""better offenses.""

On the other hand I and others argued that advances in analytics resulted in better offenses in general, that today's better offenses might beat the average of past eras by an even bigger margin if sent back in time, and that those exact historic offenses would not be as good relative to average in this era if run exactly the same today because they were midrange-heavy. 

If you assume those past offenses change completely today (i.e. that 2003-04 Nash and Dirk would take a higher volume of threes due to laxer perimeter defense), or that the current Mavs would be forced by stricter defense rules to change their offense in a different era, you start diving into speculation.

Since we can never know whether league rule changes vs. advances in offensive design contributed more to the result, I'd rather hold up the better result in an era where the average is much higher as the ""best"" and qualify that.

**How far does this ""relative to average matters more"" logic go?**

In 1982-83, the league average 3 point percentage was 23.8%. That year Mike Dunleavy led the league in 3PAs (194) and 3P% (34.5%), so +10.7 over league average. Meanwhile in 2015-16, when Steph Curry won unanimous MVP, his 3P% (45.4%) was ""only"" +10 over league average (35.4%). Would anyone claim, using the ""relative to average"" argument, that 1982-83 Mike Dunleavy the ""better three point shooter"" simply because he outperformed his era's terrible average by a larger margin? Even though his ""best"" was below the average of the entire 2015-16 league?

The central problem with the relative to average argument is that priorities are constantly shifting. At first three point shooting was seen as a gimmick and ""not true basketball"", then as something only good shooters should even attempt or you'd get benched. Now it's something teams like Dallas and Houston are building the vast majority of their offense around from top to bottom.

We take more threes and less midrange shots and post ups than ever because analytics became a thing. As a result, players expectations of becoming an at least decent three point shooter at nearly every position might affect league averages. When you have centers and bad shooters across the league taking more three pointers, the league average 3P% falling is a natural expectation. On the other hand, everybody is practicing and prioritizing it so averages overall may rise or fall depending on the distribution of shooting vs. quality of shooter.. 

**Conclusion**

While fluctuations in league average and changes in league rules are relevant to results, trying to use relativity to league average as the basis for what counts as the ""best x ever"" is a hugely flawed approach. If you drop Steph or Seth Curry or prime Kyle Korver into 1982-83 with current skill and knowledge intact, he's going to blow away Mike Dunleavy's league-leading percentage, even if he has a somewhat down year due to hand checking rules. Transport Dunleavy to this era with his previous skill and knowledge intact and he might shoot better with laxer defense, but unlikely to approach the great shooters of today.

**TL; DR:** Why would we reward outliers in low average years over the better actual result when crowning something the best ""x"" ever?",nbadiscussion

1658,663,How can reporters know who the frontrunners for players are and where a player is likely to sign if negotiations can only begin in June 30th?,"The report from Shams just came out saying the Hornets and Kemba are having ""sizable gaps"", and multiple teams are competing for him (Mavs, Knicks and Celtics). I can see where that came from. If I'm not crazy, I think the players can negotiate with their current teams before free-agency comes, so it makes sense that Walker was unhappy with the offer and his camp released this news to attract market.

Now, Woj reported later that the Celtics are frontrunners to sign him. How can he say that? I don't think Kemba's camp would release that without having a meeting with Ainge first, and also that wouldn't be beneficial for him since other teams might not engage in the run for him knowing another team has an advantage before the negotiation period even start. And if Kemba and Boston did meet, doesn't that break the rules? Also, they apparently are doing so in a very open way, since the most famous reporter is releasing the news.

Does someone here knows how that works? I would love to actually understand what is going on for the next days before free-agency opens.",nbadiscussion

1662,667,If the Lakers strike out on AD this summer I think they will target Bradley Beal,"The Lakers might lose the battle for AD to Boston and then the question becomes what's next and where do they go from there. I think rumors hinted at their backup plan earlier this season. They will go after Bradley Beal and make a push for another FA. The Lakers have a time sensitive goal of keeping cap space for a max slot which is detailed in this thestepien article and more precisely points 6 7 and 8. https://www.thestepien.com/2019/02/04/nba-notes-key-factors-consider-anthony-davis-trade/

6) That’s right, the Lakers are actually the team under the gun, and not the Pelicans. And if New Orleans actually look at the cards in the Lakers’ hand and figure out their endgame, they will see it clearly Those cards amount to this: 

Lebron James + the wish to add two more legit max players to play beside him. Period. End of story. 

All of these young players the Lakers want you to believe they are so fond of, they want to do nothing more than to jettison them. The reason being that their contracts take up too much damn cap space. Lonzo at 8 or 9 million next summer. Ingram at 7. Kuzma, Hart, Wagner at 2 million. 

It adds up when you consider that the salary cap is estimated to be $109 million, the Lakers will owe Lebron James between 37 and 38 million and they have five million in dead money from stretching Luol Deng. Just counting Lebron and Deng, we’re at 66 million in available cap space for the 2019 off-season, and that’s not yet counting the minimum cap holds for empty roster spots which subtracts another six off the top. 

So 60 million to add two max free agents. Here’s the problem: the first year for a max free agent contract is on schedule to be 32.7 million dollars. The math is easy. Sixty minus thirty-two point seven is less than thirty-two point seven. Thus, the Lakers will not have enough available cap space to sign two more max free agents next summer or the year after. Which makes the next point obvious: 

In order to place two more legitimate max level players next to Lebron, the Lakers NEED to trade for one who is currently earning less than somewhere around 27 or 28 million. Cue Anthony Davis, who will earn almost exactly 27 million in the last year of his contract.

​

7) Essentially, to enact their master plan, the Lakers NEED to trade for Anthony Davis. And, since there are hardly any worthy unrestricted free agents in 2020 besides Davis and Draymond, they need to do it by start of free agency next summer. 

That is, the Lakers are under far more time pressure than New Orleans. They can’t merely wait out the Pelicans, and it’s not just because some team may offer Zion or that Boston’s best seven offers are all better than anything the Lakers can dream of offering, or even that a team like Philadelphia does in the end decide to become involved.  It’s because signing Davis in free agency for a max will preclude the Lakers from adding two legitimate max free agents to place around Lebron.

​

8) What’s more, not acquiring Davis before the start of 2019 free agency will preclude the Lakers from participating in 2019 free agency, since signing any player to a max will inevitably take up the cap space they are intending to save for Davis in 2020. Of course, they could trade that player after a year, but then the Lakers are still left with problems besides seeming disloyal, since those kinds of trades never return fair value on the dollar and building around two superstars, even those as good as Lebron and Davis, is more difficult than building around three (if Kyrie does indeed want to team up with Lebron again).

​ Beal's contract is 27M next year as well. Even though the Pels might hate the Lakers and their assets Idt the Wizards feel the same way and the Porter trade signals rebuild to me. The cost of Beal will be less so maybe the Lakers can somehow keep some pieces to surround Bron and Beal and SuperstarX. Do they have a good shot at getting him? Is this a good plan for them? What does the trade look like?

1666,671,The Top 500 Players in the NBA (Episode 1),"Counting down every player in the NBA is no easy task, but it’s been a joy for me to study the game seriously in the last 3-4 years, and I hope this list is better than the years before.

A little about me: I’m 27, and just completed a job of writing for an NBA youtube channel for the last ten months. Before that, I wrote freelance on Reddit for 2-3 years, and I am returning to do more now. My professional career is kind of in limbo right now, but I trust the universe to pull me in the right direction.

In past years’ I analyzed box scores, but after working a professional job at making NBA content, the biggest lesson I learned about this list is the importance of advanced statistics. I will be using CleaningTheGlass.com to piece together the story on many players.

All 511 players will be thoroughly analyzed, and this will be a 50-part series with 1 article released a day for the next 50 days.

Let the fun begin.

***527. Matt Mooney (Cleveland Cavaliers)***

*6’3, 23.6 years old.*

Many of these 1st few players are clear fringe NBA players but don’t count them out either. One example is during the 2018 season, I had Royce O’Neale last for two months, and he is now a solid NBA player who recently signed an extension.

Mooney’s path is unlikely. He had just two scholarship offers and committed to Air Force. He averaged only 6.9 points-per-game and then played for South Dakota. Mooney did better there and grad-transferred to Texas Tech (Mooney lived in a party house, and the coaches would visit him there) for his final college season. This turned out to be the best possible decision for his professional career, as Texas Tech made the national championship. Mooney scored 22 points in a win against Michigan State in the final 4.

His play in a significant conference prepared Mooney for the big leagues enough as he made the 2nd team All-Big 12 and played four games for the Cleveland Cavaliers on a two-way contract. He played 42 G-League games and averaged 13.1 PPG and 4.7 APG with decent shooting splits. He still turned himself from a fringe college basketball player to play in 4 NBA games, very impressive.

***526. Joe Chealey (Charlotte Hornets)***

*6’3, 24.8 years old.*

Chealey has overcome some obstacles: he tore his Achilles before what was supposed to be his junior season in 2016. Joe came back the next season to make the 1st team all-conference squad twice and had 32 points for the College of Charleston in the CAA championship to make the NCAA tournament in 2018.

Joe has been a fringe NBA player since last season (he was the last place on my 2019 list) and regressed in the G-League this year compared to 2019. Still, to make the NBA after suffering a torn Achilles is cool.

***525. JP Macura (Cleveland Cavaliers)***

*6’5, 25.2 years old*

Macura was a supervillain for Xavier in college. As college teammate Trevon Bluiett told the Athletic about JP though says a different story:

*“If you’re on the outside looking in, I feel like most people just hate him, his overall attitude and demeanor that he brings on the court,” Xavier senior Trevon Bluiett says. “What you don’t know is that he’s one of the nicest guys ever. The way he acts on the court is a total 180 from the way he acts off the court.”*

Macura is a fringe NBA player similar to Chealey, but in his 2nd big-league season, improvement with a 64.6 2 pt%, 2.2 steals per game, and a 17.9 PER.

***524. Jarrod Uthoff (Washington Wizards)***

*6’9, 27.2 years old*

Uthoff concluded the season with a solid 8-point-performance against the Celtics, and honestly, he could probably be higher than this. He made a couple of nice moves on Grant Williams, and in 3 games in the bubble, Uthoff averaged 5 PPG on over 54% shooting. These were all meaningless games. The best-case scenario is a Davis Bertans type role.

***523. Jordan Bone (Detroit Pistons)***

*6’2, 22.8 years old*

Bone was ranked as just the 171st best senior in the 2016 class by 247sports and is best known for the wild celebration he had after drafting a few picks before going undrafted—a very well-respected college player at Tennessee.

Although he hardly saw any NBA action, Bone did show promise in the G-League this season. His averages (17 PPG good efficiency) were stable, and my verdict is he will finish higher next year and has a spot in the league.

***522. Jonah Bolden (Phoenix Suns)***

*6’10, 24.6 years old*

Bolden was a sleeper prospect for “The Process” 76ers, but his potential has not come to fruition, and he finishes outside of the top 500 this year. He only received action after Phoenix had four big men injured. Looking at some highlights from the G-League, he still has some excellent inside-outside potential, but nothing extraordinary screams out about his game.

***521. Daryl Macon (Miami Heat)***

*6’3, 24.7 years old*

Macon has been a fringe NBA player for the last two years but has averaged 18 PPG in the G-League since 2018, and even appears in a few NBA games after starting his college basketball career at Holmes Community College in Mississippi is a significant accomplishment.

Daryl recently signed in Turkey, and he will continue his professional career overseas it looks like for 2021.

***520. Josh Gray (New Orleans Pelicans)***

*6’1, 27.0 years old*

After just averaging 5.4 points-per-game and shooting 21.6% from long range his last year in college in 2016 (as a teammate to Ben Simmons on LSU), Gray worked his way up in the G-League and looking at his highlights now, and he is a fearless point guard when driving to the basket. He averaged over 22 PPG in the G-League with a 17.9 PER in 2020. I could see him in a steady 2nd string PG spot if everything goes right, although that might be a big if.

***519. Ignas Brazdeikas (New York Knicks)***

*6’7, 21.6 years old*

Brazdeikis averaged over 20 PPG in the G-League this year and shot just over 34% from 3, and watching him play, and I get the feeling of “his athleticism will hold him back” in the NBA. Still, who knows what is happening with the Knicks and I have been wrong about players before.

***518. Brian Bowen (Indiana Pacers)***

*6’7, 21.8 years old*

Bowen has superior scoring ability but lacks NBA strength and playmaking ability. Still, his scoring ability is real, and he is young enough to where he could be a staple NBA player by 23 or 24 years old if he develops in the right direction.

***517. Marques Bolden (Cleveland Cavaliers)***

*6’11, 22.4 years old*

He’s a project, but the potential with Bolden could also be worth it. He can score inside, block shots, and although he shot only 18.4% from 3, his form looks nice, and he could be a staple NBA player by the time he turns 25 if he can get that 3 point average to about 35%.

***516. Chasson Randle (Golden State Warriors)***

*6’2, 27.6 years old*

Did you know Chasson Randle has a burger named after him? You can find “The Chasson” at local restaurant Pee Wee’s in Rock Island, Illinois. Randle played 49 games for the Wizards last year and had some excellent performances but only appeared in 3 games for the Warriors in 2020. Still, Randle is a fighter who started his career in the Czech Republic and as he told The Athletic a year ago:

*“I’m just here to do my job and play the cards that are dealt to me and go from there.”*

***515. Devontae Cacok (LA Lakers)***

*6’7, 23.8 years old*

Cacok was an offensive lineman as a kid and did not play basketball until the 8th grade. Cacok shot over 65% from the field in the g-league in 2020, mostly around the basket. He appeared in just one game for the Lakers, but in that one game scored 6 points. Devontae is a player who would have fit a lot better in the NBA 10 years ago, but depending on the situation, he could have a spot as a reserve somewhere.

***514. Jared Harper (Phoenix Suns)***

*5’11, 22.9 years old*

Harper 1st started playing basketball on a nerf hoop in his room, and after a junior season for Auburn in 2019, he averaged over 15 points-per-game and made the All-SEC 2nd Team, Harper entered the draft and did not get selected. Although he played just 3 NBA games, Jared showed some pro potential in the G-League. He has Curry range, is efficient (20.2 PPG, 36% from 3), he still needs to find his identity a little bit, but I can see him being a solid NBA player (potentially with the Knicks who he just signed with) in 2-3 years.

***513. Tyler Zeller (San Antonio Spurs)***

*7’0, 30.6 years old*

The number 17 pick in 2012, Zeller was a solid rotation big man for the duration of his rookie contract, but he’s only played in 8 NBA games since 2018. He didn’t show anything significant, but he’s a seven-footer with some skills, and teams keep signing him.

***512. Tariq Owens (Phoenix Suns)***

*6’10, 25.2 years old*

The 2nd player from Texas Tech to crack the list, Owens, has overcome a lot. His mother passed away in 2010, and he embraced the game of basketball. Like his father, Renard, says:

*“Basketball saved my son’s life,” Renard said. “I really believe that. Basketball was the one constant thing for him. … It was the one thing he could go to express himself. He was able to connect with that, and it gave him a safe place to be in.”*

As for his actual game, Owens has incredibly friendly length, and he is a decent scorer, good rebounder and shot-blocker, while also having a developing 3 point shot (28.6% in g-league). At 25, we’ll see how much more he develops, but he is a fun player to watch.

***511. Jalen Lecque (Phoenix Suns)***

*6’4, 20.2 years old*

Lecque was a unique case of going from high school to the NBA in the one-and-done era. As Lecque told the athletic after going undrafted but signing with the Phoenix Suns:

*“It’s kind of crazy,” Lecque said. “I was just taking my finals a couple of months ago and now I’m in the NBA.”*

His first year was a work in progress though, he only appeared in 3 NBA games, and although he was able to make some hype plays, he shot just over 21% from long range. Still, he’s not even 21; I’d give it another year before making a conclusive verdict.

***510. William Howard (Houston Rockets)***

*6’8, 26.8 years old*

Howard was prepared to play basketball at the University of Washington, because of a low English score was denied entry to D1 by the NCAA in 2012. So he went back to his home country of France and played there for seven years.

The Utah Jazz bought out his contract in France to sign him in the summer of 2019, and he eventually ended up on a two-way contract with the Houston Rockets. He showed potential as a 3&D guy in the G-League (1.6 SPG, over 36% from 3) but ultimately ended up in France where he signed with ASVEL.

***509. Quinndary Weatherspoon (San Antonio Spurs)***

*6’4, 24.0 years old*

Weatherspoon was on cloud nine after being drafted by San Antonio. Scouts respected his game, as two of them told The Athletic:

*“He’s not a scrub,” an Eastern Conference scout said. “He’s strong and athletic and can make shots.”*

*“Good player on both sides of the ball,” a Western Conference scout added. “Plus, he has good character.”*

*In the G-League, Weatherspoon averaged 14.8 PPG, 4.8 APG, 4.0 RPG, and 1.2 SPG. His 3 point shooting efficiency could use some work (just 33.6%).*

His jump shot is very fluid and I could see him, and he cracked the Spurs rotation in the bubble. I could see him getting more minutes next year.

***509. Ryan Anderson (Houston Rockets)***

*6’10, 32.3 years old*

Anderson was once one of the more dangerous scoring threats in the league (42% from 3 2015-2017), but he fell off very quickly as he has only played in 25 NBA games since 2018. He was cut just a month after the regular season started, and there is a good chance that Anderson has played his final NBA game.

***508. Kostas Antetokounmpo (LA Lakers)***

*6’10, 22.7 years old*

Kostas Antetokounmpo told The Athletic 2 years ago:

*“Some people call me the Greek Freak 2.0,” the younger Antetokounmpo tells his interviewer. “But I don’t really have a nickname yet. Just call me Kostas.”*

A few years later, he does not have a bonafide nickname, but after going undrafted in 2018 with an up-and-down rookie season, Kostas did improve in his 2nd professional season. In the G-League, his PPG jumped from 10.6 to 14.1, he shot nearly 69% on 2-point-shots, and his PER jumped from 14.7 to 17.9.

Still not 23 years old, Kostas probably needs to put on 15 more pounds, but I would say his ceiling could be an excellent rotation player even as soon as a year.

1667,672,Who are the best coaches in the NBA?,"This topic always seems to come up every couple of months, but I haven't really seen any serious activity on it since before this season. So, with another season under our belts, it may be time to re-evaluate. Who are the best coaches in the NBA? (Not in the CoTY sense)

Of course, there are many different ways to approach this question: best coach this season (Coach of the Year), best coach in terms of career achievement, best player managing coach, best rotations, etc. However, I am most curious to see what criteria people prioritize in terms of ranking just the best coaches in the NBA right now. Again for clarity, not the best season or career, but the best coaches in the NBA right now.

I'd be interested to see people's ranking of the coaches in the NBA, whether that's the top 5, 10, or all 26 current head coaches. It is obviously very difficult to estimate a coach's value, so perhaps sorting them into tiers is a more appropriate approach.

1. Nick Nurse
2. Erik Spoelstra
3. Gregg Popovich
4. Brad Stevens
5. Rick Carlisle
6. Steve Kerr
7. Quin Snyder
8. Mike Budenholzer

1668,673,Who are the best in the business at writing deep dives into NBA players,"Want to see the different kinds of approaches some people take to deep dives. You don’t really see them too often on more publicised sites, so I’d love to know about any guys hustling for Fansided or SI or some other medium, who aren’t really appreciated more.

Or if there are more publicised NBA writers who’ve done player deep dives in the past.

I’m planning to write my own deep dive on a certain maligned(at least in certain circles of the fanbase) Hornets guard, but at the moment that piece is basically just a whole bunch of film. 

I want to find a way to appeal to the more “casual” fans because it’s ultimately those guys that constantly talk shit about this certain player.

1669,674,[OC] Not all threes are created equal: Separating three point attempts allowed by quality of the shooter,"Follow-up to [last season's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ayuaub/oc_the_bucks_have_the_most_unique_3pt_defensive/) about the Milwaukee Bucks' three point defense, updated for this season.

The three pointer is the king of the NBA. Not only is the shot itself more efficient than one a couple steps in, but the spacing provided by the threat of an open shot is the grease to a modern NBA offense's firepower. Defenses are forced to respect the deep ball, requiring wing defenders to cover an insane amount of ground and leaving the paint vulnerable to attack. Bigs have perhaps been affected most in the new era, with shooting skill valued at a premium and new defensive responsibilities resulting in the death of the traditional slow-footed center and an increase in rangy, undersized fives. The recent shift in offensive philosophy to a trigger-happy approach has resulted in an explosion of offensive efficiency, both from the three-point line and at the rim.

However, lost in the three-point craze is the fact that not everyone is a knockdown shooter. Sometimes, it may be more effective for a defense to concede a decent look from deep if it means that they can focus on locking down the paint or putting pressure on the ballhandler. In other words, an open three isn't necessarily a desirable offensive outcome if the shooter is below average.

So from the defense's perspective, if they can somehow get poor shooters to let it fly, they can consider that a successful possession. With that idea in mind, I wanted to look into which teams allowed the most threes from below average shooters, and whether this strategy could be incorporated into a successful defensive approach. The Milwaukee Bucks of last season under Coach Budenholzer executed this strategy with great success, as [Ben Falk had noted](https://cleaningtheglass.com/bucking-the-trend-follow-up/) and my research had suggested. The Bucks return this season with mostly the same roster and the same style. However, a big change in personnel stemming from the loss of Malcolm Brogdon could make this defensive approach less feasible.

# Method

I categorized each player according to their three point volume and accuracy so far this season. Then I went into box score data and, for each team, averaged their total three pointers allowed per game grouped by category. Finally I plotted this data, separating below average shooters from above average shooters. I also threw in the same data separated by position.

# Here are the results:

* [By Accuracy](https://i.imgur.com/oZcHhTk.png)
* [By Volume](https://i.imgur.com/tsrEsb6.png)
* [By Position](https://i.imgur.com/FKmbwrb.png) (Big vs. Guard/Wing)

# Some thoughts:

* It's interesting to see the contrasting styles of good defensive teams. Milwaukee and Toronto both give up a ton of threes overall but rank 1st and 2nd respectively in defensive efficiency. The Sixers, on the other hand, limit threes better than any other team in the league, and rank 4th.
* Conceding three point attempts to low volume or low accuracy shooters could be a good indicator of an effective defense. The Orlando Magic appear to have executed this strategy of selective threes to the best effect thus far, leading the league in allowing three point attempts to low volume shooters and 2nd in preventing high volume shooter attempts. Their defense is ranked 12th.
* As for the Bucks, their strategy (and/or execution) has changed a bit - they remain at the top of the league in opponent three pointers attempted, but have given up a higher proportion of threes to better shooters. This could be the result of a personnel shift leading them to double down on rim protection. Although their style may have shifted, their results have not - they rank 1st in the league in defensive efficiency.

1670,675,Are there too many uniforms now? NBA and franchises are slowly losing brand recognition. Thoughts,"SVP said something yesterday during SportsCenter, he said, ""There are so many uniforms now I dont know who is playing anymore.""  I have always felt this to be true since Nike has taken over.

No longer can I watch a highlight at a glance and know who is playing, who is the home team, who is the road team.  That matters because with all the player movement now, fans are most allegiant to their franchise, which is represented by a piece of laundry.  It sounds small but over time that erodes brand recognition.

I find myself watching NBA highlights and taking longer than in the past to recognize the teams AND the players because of Nikes drive to sell more jerseys.  Sure, we can look at the score graphic, but in youtube highlight videos, alternate angles, or replays those indicators wont be there.

Also, when the road team is white (not always, but mostly), that is also problematic for recognition purposes.  If the home team was white, the court serves as an initial indicator.  Road teams wearing white removes their identity (which I guess is the purpose but hurts recognizability).   In addition, having home teams wear their dark jerseys at home make for terrible contrast on tv as their uniforms often are the exact same color shade as the key.  The old schemes of white at home, dark on the road popped the best.",nbadiscussion
1671,676,Is Lebron the ultimate Small forward?,"
Mike was the greatest SG who ever played. So we idolized the standard he set for us. He raised the bar for the game of basketball and many players wanted to mimic his play style. Even the great Kobe Bryant couldn’t fill his shoes. He was damn near perfect. 


Personally I believe Lebron is the best SF to play the game. There’s not much room for improvement either, as Lebron had few weaknesses in his game.  He was damn near perfect..
I’m curious what the future holds for this position now that Lebron has set the new standard..

But does that mean Lebron is the ideal depiction of the ultimate SF?

1673,678,[OC] Mocking the 2019 Free Agency - How much money is out there?,"What's up guys, [this is actually a repost](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/c5j39e/oc_mocking_the_2019_free_agency_how_much_money_is/), I wanted to start some discussion on how much money is out there in the free agency, and the possible bargains it may generate. 

Another great addition was made by /u/thedarkwingthatducks , there are 290 rostered spots right now, with the probable addition of about 45 players by draft + come over from europe (Like Nando de Colo and Vincent Poirier) + 2 way players that actually sign deals (Like Caruso), there just might be about 115 to 110 roster spots available, even though there are at least 140 players in the Free Agency that are true NBA players. So many might come short in terms of roster spots, what might just means some going to China, some signing a prove yourself 2 way deal (4 year or younger veterans though) like Rodney McGruder.

There are about 200 players entering the 2019 Free Agency, and only 13 to 15 teams will actually have cap space:



Teams | Projected Space
-----|---------------
Atlanta | $13.0 MM
Boston | $34.1 MM
Brooklyn | $68.7 MM
Chicago | $21.0 MM
Dallas | $29.9 MM
Indiana | $34.1 MM
Clippers | $51.8 MM
Lakers | $27.8 MM
Bucks | $19.5 MM
NOLA | $30.3 MM
New York | $70.5 MM
Phoenix | $14.1 MM
Kings | $62.6 MM

Projected cap space done by Keith Smith. Some things are addepted: The Nets and the Nuggets cap space.

Some assumptions here: Nuggets opt in with Paul Millsap and Nets rennounce (in some point) D'Angelo Russell.

#Total Cap space: 477.4 Million dollars.

And that's with 70 million from the Knicks, who are still in the beggining of their rebuild. A good part of the most coveted free agents are actually **old veterans** and will be something very interesting.

You can already guess that this means a lot of players will be without a chair when the music stops, and a lot of bargains will happen. But to help understading how bad it is, I will mock the max FA and see how much money is left after that. I'm not being partial here, I don't really care where this guys go, I just want to know how much money will the 2nd tier get.

#Mocking the max FA situations:

I will use a lot of tables in this post so it's easier to see.

 

Player | Team he signs
------|-------------
Kevin Durant | Brooklyn Nets
Kawhi Leonard | Toronto Raptors
Kyrie Irving | Brooklyn Nets
Klay Thompson | GSW
Kemba Walker | Boston Celtics
Jimmy Butler | Phillly 76ers
Tobias Harris | Indiana Pacers
Khris Middleton | Milwaukee Bucks

That's a simulation with only 4/9 players actually changing teams, the more the players change from a team that will  be capped out even if they lose him to a team that had cap space, the lesser money will be around for 2nd tier guys. The new projected space would look like:

Teams | Projected Space
-----|---------------
Atlanta | $13.0 MM
Chicago | $21.0 MM
Dallas | $29.9 MM
Clippers | $51.8 MM
Lakers | $27.8 MM
Bucks | $19.5 MM
NOLA | $30.3 MM
New York | $70.5 MM
Phoenix | $14.1 MM
Kings | $62.6 MM
New Total | **$340.5 MM**

PS: Charlotte, 76ers, Warriors still wouldn't have projected cap space.

340.5 Million dollars isn't a lot. That can give you 20 x 17 million dollar salaries. Now let's see a list of players you'd expect to get more than the MLE but less than the max, using an descending money expected to be earn order:

#The 20 miliion plus group

No. | Player
---|------
1 | Al Horford
2 | Nikola Vucevic
3 | Harrison Barnes
4 | D'Angelo Russell
5 | Malcom Brogdon

These players I'd expect to have a 20+ million market. A lot of teams are considering overpaying for Brogdon, Russell will have a market, and there are reports that Barnes opted out of his contract expecting to receive an about 20/yera one.

Al Horford contract reportedly has a 114 million dollar offer, considering the team will probably front load it, that's a hair under 31 million dollars in his first year. 

Let's mock it:



Player | Money on first year |Team he signs
---|-------------------|----
Al Horford | $31,000,000 | Dallas
D'Angelo Russell | $25,000,000 | NY Knicks
Malcom Brogdon | $21,000,000 | Chicago Bulls
Harrison Barnes | $21,000,000 | Kings
Nikola Vucevic | Re-signs | Orlando Magic

That gives you $95 million less in money, with the Bucks regaining 3 million dollars in cap space without Brogdon's cap hold.

#Total Cap Space: 245.5 million

Now we have the 3rd tier group, with players there are rumors of 14-20 million dollars (Windhorst recently said he expects Patrick Beverley to get 14-15 million).

&nbsp;

#The 3rd tier

No. | Player
---|------
6 | Bojan Bogdanovic
7 | Brook Lopez
8 | Danny Green
9 | Pat Beverley
10 | Nikola Mirotic

These players have good age and would fit well a lot of teams. They're all highly coveted and will have a lot of pursuers. 

Bucks expect to bring Brook Lopez back. On our mock they have 22.5 million to do that and that will be enough, but I'd expect for them to be out of bigger than MLE Cap Space after, basically dropping out of our list.

The Clippers ($51.8MM), Kings ($41.6 MM) and the Knicks ($45.5 MM) still have a lot of cap space here. 



Player | Money on 1st yr | Team he signs
---|---|----
Bojan Bogdanovic | $19,000,000 | LA Clippers
Brook Lopez | $17,000,000 | Bucks
Danny Green |$15,000,000 | LA Lakers
Pat Beverley | $14,000,000| Clippers
Nikola Mirotic | $14,000,000 | Kings

Let's take a look how is our projected cap space right now.

Teams | Projected Space
-----|---------------
Atlanta | $13.0 MM
Clippers | $18.8 MM
Lakers | $12.8 MM
NOLA | $30.3 MM
New York | $45.5 MM
Phoenix | $14.1 MM
Kings | $27.6 MM
New Total | **$162.1 MM**

The new outlook here isn't counting the Bucks because they'd have only 5 million, what's pretty much the Room MLE. 

162 million to pretty much 150 players in this league isn't looking good. Of course we still have the MLE but we're walking towards the moneypocalypse. 

#The next under 15 million group of guys:

No. | Player
---|------
11 | Jeremy Lamb
12 | Terrence Ross
13 | Dewayne Dedmon
14 | Terry Rozier
15 | DeMarcus Cousins
16 | Thaddeus Young  
17 | Tomas Satoransky 
18 | Marcus Morris 
19 | Trevor Ariza 
20 | George Hill

 
Let's go straight to the mock:

Player | Money on 1st yr | Team he signed
---|---|----
Jeremy Lamb | $13,000,000 | Atlanta
Terrence Ross | $12,000,000 | NOLA
Dewayne Dedmon |$15,000,000 | NOLA
Terry Rozier | $14,000,000| Phoenix Suns
Cousins | $20,000,000 (1yr) | Knicks
Thaddeus Young | I'm not sure | 
Tomas Satoransky| $13,000,000 | NY Knicks
Marcus Morris |$18,000,000 | LA Clippers
Trevor Ariza| $10,000,000 (1yr) | Sacramento Kings
Hill | $12,500,000 | Lakers

Without much options, the Knicks decide to risk for Cousins, but on a small term contract. The Suns got their new point guard, Atlanta got a good player for cheap that fits them. Clippers got Marcus Morris on the Avery Bradley/Derrick Favors deal, with an unguaranteed 2nd year with a late date. NOLA is reportedly looking for a new center, and they found one of the most wanted free agents. Thaddeus Young simply ran out of money + fit, and that's where it''s intersting:

Teams | Projected Space
-----|---------------
New York | $10.5 MM
Kings | $17.6 MM
New Total | **$28.1 MM**

Basically, we ran out of money. With 19 players. 

&nbsp;

#The next crop of wanted players

No. | Player
---|------
21 | Rudy Gay
22 | Jonas Valenciunas
23 | Julius Randle
24 | Rodney Hood 
25 | Derrick Rose
26 | Seth Curry
27 | Al Farouq Aminu  
28 | Darren Collinson 
29 | Ricky Rubio
30 | Wesley Matthews 
31 | Cory Joseph
32 | JaMychal Green
33 | Mike Scott
33 | Garrett Temple
34 | Iman Shumpert 
35 | Nerlens Noel
36 | Enes Kanter
37 | Jabari Parker
38 | Ed Davis
39 | Austin Rivers
40 | Taj Gibson
41 | Elfrid Payton
42 | Reggie Bullock

I'm already excluding some restricted free agents that I think are pretty likely to re-sign and not impact the overall free agency money (Like Bobby Portis and Kelly Oubre Jr). But that's 20 players that I thouhgt were going to get some money, but right now I'm just not sure. The teams' money is pretty much over and right now they would only have the MLE. 

Exceptions: Valenciunas, Derrick Rose, Jabari Parker (will probably re-sign with it's original team).

Julius Randle seem to have made a meh decision, as he's not even that guaranteed to get the full non-MLE. Oh, and what teams actually have a full non taxpayer MLE?



Team | How likely to use it?
----|---------------------
Detroit | 20%
Nuggets | 20%
Charlotte | 10%
GS Warriors | 100% (keeping one of Klay and KD)
Houston | 70%
Memphis | 50%
Minnesota | 90%
Orlando | 80%
Philly | 100%
Portland | 30%
San Antonio | 100%
Utah | 90%
Washington | 10%

I think it's a pretty likely universe **where only 7 MLE will be available to players**, and that's if teams don't decide to just give part of it to 2nd round players. That would mean that player from the level of Darren Collinson will be available in the Free Agency for less than the MLE, actually for the Taxpayer MLE or the room expection.

That also shows a **very scary world for center**, because names like: Robin Lopez, JeVale McGee, Jordan Bell, DeAndre Jordan, Faried, Zubac, Looney, Noah, Holmes are probably not even getting any kind of money, just going for the minimum salary. 

**Other players that felt to the minimum salary level:** DeMarre Carroll, Alec Burks, Wilson Chandler, KCP, Justin Holiday, Jeremy Lin, James Ennis, Wayne Ellington, TJ McConnell, Ish Smith, Jeff Green, Rajon Rondo, Danuel House, Rondae Hollis Jefferson, Gerald Green, Kyle O'Quinn, MCW, Luc Moute. 

If their original teams don't bail them out, these players may very much be available for the minimum

#Conclusion

Patient teams that wait out the market will find a lot of bargains in this free agency. That puts teams like the Lakers, top heavy teams that will have to fill their roster with short money, in prime situation, particularly because these guys will want a 1+1, or a just 1 year prove yourself minimum and the Lakers can give them minutes to excel at. 

PS: I know that the timing of the signings matter, and some players that are very much down my line of best available will be signed for more than they would go in this mock, but my intention here was really to try to understand how much money ist out there, some guys in my minimum level might get full MLEs, and it only takes 1 team to give out a lot of money to my 30-40 tier and that's part of randomness of multiple teams taking different decisions at different timings. I hope you guys like it.

1678,683,Five out offense = bad transition defense?,"Dallas and Houston are both heavily running 5-out offenses. Houston takes more three point attempts than any other team in history, and Dallas's attempts are only outpaced by Houston's past three years. With Clint Capela traded for Robert Covington and Dallas's traditional big Dwight Powell lost to an Achilles injury and replaced with Seth Curry in the starting lineup, both teams are going all in on 5-out.

[Dallas is 3rd in 2nd chance points](https://stats.nba.com/teams/misc/?sort=PTS_2ND_CHANCE&dir=-1). However, it is well known that prioritizing offensive rebounding can lead to poor transition defense.

The 5-out naturally leading to the guys in the corners being as far as possible from the opposing basket and unable to sprint back on defense until they see which way the offensive miss ricochets seems to compound the problem. Dallas has the added problem of not being elite athletically, so they get killed on the fast break.

Is this a perpetual problem of the 5-out offense or is this merely a situational problem that can be solved with better transition defenders? Does transition defense automatically get stalled because of the higher likelihood of an offensive board due to the random nature of long misses and the lack of a big parked down in the paint?

EDIT: Added links to stats. Previously called Houston an above average offensive rebounding team because I was looking at OREBS/game instead of per possession. They are actually slightly below average when you convert to per possession. Not sure if this punches holes in my thesis or if Houston is merely ceding the offensive boards for better transition defense more than Dallas is...",nbadiscussion

This past week, 24 fans participated in POSITION GOATS in which fans were asked a wide array of questions about which players were the greatest of all time at all of the different positions, among other miscellaneous questions.

We also make a magazine (free) that is released every week to go along with the survey: [https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:42c0b6ad-3a3e-4c65-aa42-61cc690532fb](https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:42c0b6ad-3a3e-4c65-aa42-61cc690532fb)

I really liked the #5 team, I think it's probably better than this team, but this is my favorite team in the tournament. Some of my all-time favorite players (Dirk, STAT, Oak, Matrix) are on this team and there's so much wing/big depth and versatility that I think this is a sleeper candidate to win or at least make a run. The starting lineup is a lot of fun with the amount of offensive firepower and options. A McGrady/Dirk or McGrady/STAT pick and roll would be devastating, I can't imagine many teams having the pieces to check that combination. Dirk and STAT are such a perfect pairing on offense (although the defense leaves a lot to be desired) with STAT rolling to the rim and Dirk spacing the floor. Marion is the ultimate glue guy who can pick up the opposing team's best wing and hit some open corner 3s (awful shot non-withstanding). Prime T-Mac and Kemba are a really dynamic backcourt, both players can go nuclear so fast. This team will be able to keep up offensively with any other team in this field

A few thoughts when constructing the roster

****


* I had Iggy as a starter with Amar'e on the bench and switched back and forth several times. Ultimately Amar'e's peak was too good to ignore, but Iggy's defensive versatility paired with that of T-Mac and Marion is a really intriguing possibility. A lineup of Kemba, Dirk or Amar'e and those 3 wings is terrifying. They would be able to switch on everything and attack defenses in a variety of ways. And that isn't even bringing up Hayward or DeRozan into the mix. The wing depth on this team is exceptional, but there is one flaw. There isn't a knockdown 3 pt shooter among them, Hayward and T-Mac are both good shooters, but they aren't really creating the same type of gravity that other wings do in this tournament. Honestly that's not really that much of a concern to me when you can have 5 different wings who can all score and defend at the level that they do, there isn't another team thus far that can lay claim to this.

* If there is a team that can contain the #1 squad's bigs a bit it would be this team. Oakley, Noah, and Drummond are 3 big bodies that you can throw at Shaq, Duncan, Robinson etc that can at least make them work for their points/boards. The real key to this team is Dirk, he fit with any other big perfectly. Dirk with Oakley or Noah would really allow him to focus on offense and Drummond would be able to clean up the boards for Dirk. This team will succeed based on Dirk's play, which will make them a really tough out.

* Guard play is really lacking here outside of Kemba and some of the wings. The next best guard who could make some 3s was DJ Augustin, which isn't great. He's been a really erratic player, but actually had a pretty good year with Orlando last year. He is a serviceable backup PG to Kemba, but I think you could get away with lineups with T-Mac as the primary ball handler and do just fine.







********
 
I love this team, they can play small, they can play big, they can defend, and they can get buckets. Dirk and T-Mac are a deadly offensive pairing and the collection of talented wings and tough bigs makes this team a true contender IMO.

Selection #10 team posted tomorrow, let me know what changes you would make in the comments. Thanks!",nbadiscussion

At the end of the series I'll start a tournament where we can decide which team is the best.

Sean Elliot | F | 1989 - 2001 | 14.2 | 4.3 | 2.6 | .8 | .4 | 55.7

****



As expected this team has a ton of accolades, cumulatively this team has:


* **55 All Star Selections**

* **33 All-NBA Selections**

* **5 All-Defense Selections**

* **2 ROY winners**

* **1 6MOY** 

* **1 MVP**

* **3 HOFer**


This team is going to be a lot of fun and is going to score a ton of points. There's so many different lineup permutations possible with this team you can go jumbo with Penny, Hill, Melo, Pau, Embiid or go small with Billups, Harden, Beal, Penny, (pick a big). This team has lots of shooting, lots of ball handlers, and 3 bigs who are more than capable of passing and shooting, actually everyone on this roster can pass and shot and score. This may be the most complete team yet.





A couple thoughts on my thinking when constructing the roster:



* I went with Penny and Grant in the starting lineup over Billups and Melo, but I keep going back and forth over it. Penny had a much higher peak than Billups, but was a worse shooter and not as stout on defense. Penny's peak was just so high for me not to start him, and a backcourt of Harden and Penny would be really fascinating to watch.

  * Grant Hill over Melo was a bit easier for me. Obviously Melo is on another level as a scorer (although before injuries Grant Hill was much closer to Melo than it may seem), the difference in defense and shot creation for others convinced me that he would be a better fit next to Harden. Melo could also be in at the 4, which would create a pretty dynamic lineup, but prime Pau is such a talented player that I'm not too worried about slightly worse spacing.



* Not a ton of bigs on this team (and not a ton of great options to choose from Laettner, Favors, LaFrentz, Kanter, Okafor, etc..), but Embiid, Pau, and Horford are all so talented that I'm not too concerned about any lack of depth. 



* The bench is a bit guard heavy, but they're all pretty tremendous guards. I'm not sure how well Billups and D-Will could play together at the same time, but Davis and Beal can both thrive off ball. 

* Sean Elliot is a bit overshadowed on this team, but he's such a great uber role player. I would love to see him and Grant Hill play off of each other, it would be pretty awesome. 



********

Let me know if you think I'm an idiot, if you don't give a shit, or if you've read any of this.

1686,691,Interested in radical hypothetical changes to pro basketball? I've got a bunch.,"I've been keeping this document going for a minute. It's an outlandishly-macro restructuring of pro bball, overhauling everything from the court dimensions and association structure to player contracts and league finances.

If you've got some extra time during this agonizing season of no-NBA/no-basketball, please give it a read. I'm curious what a new kind of basketball might look like, and what radically different ideas others have conceived of for high-level basketball!

(The goal of this type of reconstruction is to highlight basketball's unique aesthetic forms at high-level play, and to build an entertainment machine that better benefits both the craftsmen of the game and the communities in which teams are based.)

The NABA

North American Basketball Association: a Proposal for the Evolution of Professional Basketball Structures Away from the current NBA

&#x200B;

Contents

1. Association Structure and Leagues
2. The Regular Season and Special Events
3. The Playoffs
4. Changes to the Game (Rules changes and new Court Dimensions)
5. Association Parity, Team Ownership, and Financial Structure
6. End of Season Awards and Arena Pomp

&#x200B;

1. Association Structure

The current NBA’s league and conferences would be dissolved and replaced by 5 interconnected Leagues, interacting both in regular season play, mid-season tournament play, and through end-of-season promotion/relegation. These leagues will all fall under the NABA (North American Basketball Association) organizational umbrella.

The Association will be expanded by 15 teams to a total of 45 teams. The recommended cities are listed below. Preference has been given to cities based on a number of factors, including but not limited to, and in no particular order: size of population, city wealth, geographic parity, representation of North American national diversity, cities with large arenas. These are suggested as follows: 1. Kansas City, 2. Seattle, 3. Mexico City, 4. Los Angeles, 5. Chicago, 6. Newark, 7. San Diego, 8. San Juan (Puerto Rico), 9. Pittsburgh, 10. Las Vegas, 11. Nashville, 12. Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic), 13. Oakland, 14. Vancouver (British Columbia), 15. St. Louis.

Each of the 5 Leagues will consist of 9 teams.

League composition is solely determined by play, not by geography. The formation of the NABA will occur five years after the adoption of this proposal, and Leagues 1, 2, and 3 will be formed from the current 30 NBA teams based on the regular and post-season performance over these 5 seasons (overall combined total wins) leading up to the adoption of the NABA structure. Thus, the nine teams with the most wins over those five seasons will compose League 1, the next best nine will form League 2, and so forth. The three teams with the fewest overall wins over these five seasons will form League 4 along with the first six of the above listed expansion teams. League 5 will be composed entirely of expansion teams, those listed above numbers 7-15.

In all following seasons, leagues’ team composition will be adjusted according to a promotion/relegation system. That is, teams will be promoted/relegated up or down to adjacent leagues at the end of the regular season based on regular season win totals (which includes World Games and Winter Invitational wins, see below).

For teams in Leagues 2, 3, and 4 this means that the team within each league with the highest win total will be promoted up to League 1, 2, or 3 (respectively) and the team with the lowest win total will be relegated to League 3, 4, or 5 (respectively). League 1 relegates the team in the league with the lowest win total down to League 2, but has no promotion (as they are the highest League). League 5 promotes the team with highest win total to League 4, but has no relegation (as they are the lowest League).

\[The hope with these changes is to make available to more cities that ever-elusive hometown energy and excitement, currently unavailable to many small- and mid-market NBA teams b/c of the association's lack of segmented hierarchy—bad teams get stuck in decade long losing battles.\]

2. The Regular Season and Special Events

In place of the current preseason, World Games will be held in 15 major metropolitan areas outside of North America. Each of these cities will host a group of three NABA teams (teams grouped with others from their same League, but chosen by Association on the basis of quality of entertainment). These groups will play a round-robin (3 games total, 2 for each team) in that city over the course of a week and the Association will host accompanying events for fans and amateurs. Note: unlike the present pre-season games in the NBA, wins from these games do count towards the season win-total for purposes of determining playoff seeding and promotion/relegation.

Following the World Games, the regular season commences. The regular season consists of 76 games. Each team will play each of the other eight teams in their League five times (for a total of 40 games) and each of the 36 teams outside of their league one time (for a total of 36 games). These games will be spread out from mid-October to mid-April, with two one-week breaks after 25 and 50 games played per team. These breaks will be filled by the Winter Classic Invitational (after 25 games) and the All-Star Week Exhibition (after 50 games).

The Winter Mecca Invitational Tournament, held after the 25th game of the regular season, is hosted at Madison Square Garden in New York City from Christmas Day to New Years Eve. 16 teams are invited based entirely on win-total up to this point, without preference given to strength of schedule or League. (Note that this includes World Games wins, so it is possible for a team to have up to 27 wins at this point.) In the case of ties, preference is given by League (1>2…>5), and then to total regular season points-scored. The tournament itself is a four-round, single-elimination bracket, seeded using the same criteria as selection/invitation. Wins in the tournament add to season win-total. The winner of the tournament is given the NABA Winter Classic trophy to host in their home arena until the next year. A tournament MVP is selected by a panel of 45 media members.

The All-Star Week Exhibition, held after the 50th game of the regular season, is hosted in Las Vegas in mid-February. Midnight on Saturday of that week marks the season Trade Deadline. 20 All-Stars are selected to participate in the All-Star Game. These players are selected across leagues. Selection is made using a weighted single-transferable-vote of 25% each to the following groups: a panel of 45 media members, all 45 head coaches, the 45 active NABA players with the highest career total minutes played, and online fan polling. No restrictions in voting are placed based on player-position or League. The All-Star Game Captains are two players among the 20 selected with the most total fan votes. The Captains make live draft selections at the televised mid-season-award banquet held the Friday night before the All-Star Game (held on Saturday). The week leading up to the All-Star Game features five nights of events: Monday, the Rookie Showcase Game; Tuesday, the Celebrity Game and Half-Court Contest (a head-to-head style, first-to-make-a-shot event held using a bracket of 8 players); Wednesday, the Dunk Contest (featuring an 8-player group scored on a 1-100 scale) and Skills Challenge (featuring an 8-player bracket of head-to-head matchups); Thursday, the 3-Point Contest (featuring an 8-player bracket of head-to-head matchups, seeded by season total 3-pointers-made) and the Playmaker Showcase (a new rating-based contest similar to the Dunk Contest, but more theatrical, in which a player has 20 seconds to showcase their handles/footwork/artistry against a defender—selected by the playmaker—and then finish with a shot; this showcase is expected to be accompanied by a music selection and light-show; scoring is 1-100 with 50 points awarded for style/artistry, 30 for difficulty of shot and strength of defense—making the event a kind of competitive dance/duet performance—and 20 all-or-nothing points for whether the shot was made or missed); and Friday, the Mid-Season Awards Banquet (featuring the All-Star Game draft and a series of awards not included in the end-of-season awards; these might include awards such as Playmaker-of-the-Year, Assistant Coach of the Year, Best Dunk of the Season, etc.) and All-Star Game draft; and finally on Saturday, the All-Star Game itself. The Association works in close cooperation with the gambling institutions of Las Vegas to make the whole week a desirable gambling experience for tourists and basketball enthusiasts.

\[The hope with these changes is mostly just to inject more fun and excitement—for both fans and players—into the season schedule. Also, fun nod to historical regular season totals records: a team that plays in the Winter Invitational final will have played 82 games by the end of the regular season.\]

&#x200B;

3. The Playoffs

The Playoffs begin on the weekend after the last game of the regular season (minimum of a 3-day break). The eight teams in League 1 with the highest win-total for the overall season (including World Games and Winter Invitational) play in the playoffs (so all but one L1 team). These teams are seeded in a bracket by win-total with ties broken by the regular season head-to-head series record (so, best of 5). The 1-seed receives a bye in Round 1. The 7- and 8-seeds play an extra best-of-3 play-in series (round 0 or Wild Card Series). Each round after the 7/8 play-in consists of best-of-7 (first to 4 wins) series. The home/away distribution of games, favoring higher seeded teams, are as follow: 2-2-1-1-1. The winner of the 7/8 play-in plays against the 2-seed in Round 1. Thus the equation for the NABA Champion is as follows: \[((1) v (4 v 5)) v ((2 v (7 v 8)) v (3 v 6))\].

\[This is fairly straightforward pro/reg stuff. To make the top of League 1 desirable throughout the regular season, I've added the bye. I played around with a truly tiered playoff, but it felt anticlimactic and maybe too much rest time for the high seeds. It would look like this: (((((((7 v 8) v 6) v 5) v 4) v 3) v 2) v 1).\]

&#x200B;

4. Changes to the Game (Court Dimensions and Rules Changes)

The court dimensions are all altered to metric. The basket is now 3 meters above the court surface (a decrease of a little less than 2 inches). The court is 28 meters long (2 feet shorter) and 16 meters wide (2 and half feet wider). The 3-point line is drawn as an 8 meter arc from the center of the hoop (2 and a half feet further), flat at 1 meter from the sideline (i.e. 7 meters at the corner 3 (close to 3 feet further than the current corner 3)). The new lane’s shape mirrors the three point line’s: an arc 4 meters from the enter of the hoop and 3 meters from the hoop at the sides (slightly shorter at the arc), significantly wider at the sides. The distance from the baseline to the backboard is 1.5 meters (about a foot deeper). The restricted circle is drawn 1.5 meters from the center of the hoop, ending on either side 1.5 meters from the baseline (i.e. flush with the backboard). The game ball is 27 centimeters in diameter (0.05 inches smaller). The hoop is 46 cm wide (0.1 inches wider). There is no half court line, but centered on the court is the 4 meter wide jump circle. All court lines are drawn 5 cm wide. All other non-conflicting court dimensions are rounded to the nearest cm of the current NBA court dimension configuration.

The most drastic change to the current rules is the elimination of the game clock. NABA games will be played first-to-100 and win-by-5.

The shot clock is shortened to 20 seconds with a 10 second reset.

All free throws are worth the full point value of the foul: so 2 or 3 on a missed shot or 1 on a made shot. Therefor a player never takes more than 1 free throw at a time. Free throws are taken from the top of the arc of the lane.

All jump balls are taken at center court.

Quarters and Halftime are determined by the leading teams score. That is, when the leading team reaches 25, 50, and 75 then the first, second, and third quarters, respectively, end. If no team has managed to achieve a 5 point lead when the leading team’s score reaches 100, then an overtime goes into affect. In overtime, the shot clock is reduced to 18 seconds with a 7-second reset, and a hard elam ending is set at 24 points more than the leading team's total. There is a short break before overtime, and each team is given an extra timeout.

Lane violations only apply to offense (allowed 1 foot in indefinitely, 2 feet for up to 3 seconds; remember here that the lane in the NABA is significantly wider than in the present NBA dimensions).

Each team has 1 Designated Big (indicated by a differently-colored jersey) for whom the offensive lane violation does not apply. When this player is on the bench, the team does not have a Designated Big (i.e. the designation is non-transferable and submitted by each team at the start of regulation: the two DBs face off in the opening jump-ball).

There is no half court violation as there is no half-court line.

Post-foul resets are played from the center court circle (instead of the sideline). On resets, defenders cannot enter the center circle until the ball is passed out (cannot be dribbled out of circle by reset player).

Any made shot in the mid-range (the area between the lane and the three point line) is make-one, take-one. That is, if a player makes a mid-range shot, their team immediately gets the ball back at mid-court.

All other non-conflicting rules are the same as in the present NBA.

\[Though folks may find these changes drastic and strange, I've considered each carefully with the intention of refocusing the strategy of pro basketball around the sport's natural aesthetic strengths—attempting to eliminate painful Harden-esque elements of current gameplay (esp. foul-drawing, clock-management, and strict shot selection) that feel more like algorithmic functions on a court than artful basketball performance. No offense to James Harden, who would still be very good in this system—and probably a hell of a lot more fun to watch.\]

5. Association Parity, Team Ownership, and Financial Structure

There is no soft or hard salary cap. The only restriction on team-spending is the NABA luxury tax line set by the NABA each off-season based on projected revenue of all teams. For every dollar over the tax line a team spends on player salaries, they must pay the NABA 2 dollars. There is no special repeater tax for teams over the line multiple consecutive seasons, just the 2 dollars on the dollar.

Off-season signings begin 1 week after the NBA Finals.

The minimum player contract is 1% of the tax line (set by the NABA each year). The maximum player contract is 45% of the tax line (available to players who have played in the association for 5 or more years).

Players receive veteran bonuses as their careers progress. The NABA itself pays veteran bonuses directly to players. Veteran bonuses are equal to 1% of the tax line value per year played (so the only players who receive no veteran bonus are rookies). This income does not count as salary for purposes of determining team tax.

Similarly, players receive loyalty bonuses from the NABA of 2% of the tax line value for every year they have spent on a team for which they have played for at least 5 seasons (calculated for total seasons played for the team; so, a player entering their fifth season with a team would not receive a loyalty bonus, but a player entering their sixth year with a team would receive a 10% loyalty bonus, increasing by 2% every year following). Again, this income does not count as salary for purposes of determining team tax.

The cost for veteran and loyalty bonuses is spread among all teams weighted according to teams’ estimated market share of NABA.

Short-term minimum contract length is 10-days pro-rated. All other contracts must be a minimum of 1 year. All contracts must be honored through injury.

The maximum contract length is 10 years. Salaries must be written as percentages of the tax line. All extensions must not make a total contract exceed ten years. Otherwise there are no restrictions on extensions, which (unlike free agency signings) are available to teams/players one year before the end of a current contract.

Player and team options may make up to one half of the total length of a contract, rounded down (for instance, a max-length contract could be a 5+1+3+1 or a 7+3 or a 5+2+1+1+1, etc.), and may be mixed (for instance, in the first of the above examples, the +1 year-six could be a player option, followed by a +3 year team option, followed by another +1 year player option).

Contract salaries may be flat, descending, or ascending year to year but must always be built around a tax-line percentage, not a specific value; so salaries shift according to the association's value.

Player/owner revenue split is set at a minimum 55% to players and maximum 45% to owners. If total team spending on players (including expected bonuses) following off-season signings does not meet the 55% mark then the difference is paid by the teams, split weighted according to team percentage of market share, to the players. This player payout is weighted among players according to total-minutes-played over the course of the past 5 seasons.

Revenue sharing between teams/owners is set at 30% (in addition to any luxury tax paid), determined after veteran and loyalty bonuses are awarded by the league.

There is no draft. Instead, rookies (minimum age of 18 as of the first day of summer signing) may sign contracts with any team they like, beginning one day before all other free agents. However, rookie contract salary maximums are scaled based on a team’s league position following promotion/relegation. These rates are as follows: League 5 20%, L4 15%, L3 10%, L2 5%, L1 1%. Furthermore, rookies minimum contract length for maximum rookie salaries is set at 3 years, maximum length at 5 years. A player may not sign for more than the respective signing team’s league’s rookie max until that player has played at least 5 years in the NABA.

Teams may trade player contracts (only with a player's consent) along with unrestricted cash-considerations. Players on rookie (or under-5th-year-in-league) contracts may only be traded to teams within their own league or lower leagues.

Public player trade demands nullify a player’s end-of-season loyalty bonus.

Teams may only be moved from a city if the greater metropolitan area agrees by 60% majority in a popular vote to allow an owner (or ownership group) to move the team.

\[There's a lot going on here, and much of it would take considerable squirming to make financially feasible; but ultimately the hope with these changes is to balance casual fans' and owners' desire for more in-organization player-personnel consistency w/ ethical valuation of players' craftsmanship/showmanship/market-draw.\]

6. End of Season Awards and Arena Pomp

The season MVP, Rookie of the Year, Coach of the Year, Most Improved Player, and 6th Man of the Year: these are all voted on using a weighted single-transferable-vote (ranked-choice) by media (a 100-member panel), players (all who played in at least 20 games), and coaches (all 45 head coaches at the end of the season);  35%/35%/30%, respectively, weighted to these three groups. A new award, Captain of the Year, goes to a player who showed great on-court leadership and is voted upon using this same method.

The Scoring Champion is selected by points-per-game, but must have played in at least 70 games (combined World, Winter, and Regular Season games) to qualify.

The General Manager of the Year is selected by a 50/50 weighted STV vote of 100 media members and all 45 team GMs at season’s end.

The First, Second, and Third All-NABA teams, and the All-Rookie and All-Defense teams (there is only one of each), are chosen by the media without regard to any positional requirements.

All other awards are same as-is. Across the board, no voting is allowed for players/coaches/GMs within their own organization (for traded players, this applies to all teams they played at least 10 games for this season).

Teams may hang banners for the following: NBA Finals Championships, Regular Season League Championships, Winter Classic Championships, and retired player jerseys.

\[Hope is to make these a little fairer and more representative of the current team structures. No biggie.\]

1687,692,Past players who would thrive in the modern NBA,"The NBA has changed quite a bit over the last 10 years. The emphasis on 3-point shooting, frequent switching on defense, and use of analytics to quantify/judge players all impact how teams play and how fans watch the game.

What players do you think would have been significantly more valued in today's modern game than they were when they played?

[**Brent Barry**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/barrybr01.html) is the player who made me think of this post. Barry was a good enough ballhander to play the point, and also had the size to guard 1-3. He also shot over 40 percent from long range, primarily as a SG. Barry shot above 80 percent from the free throw line as well, making him a very efficient offensive player overall.

[**Trent Tucker**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/tucketr01.html) and [**Allan Houston**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/houstal01.html) are players similar to Barry, but neither shot 3-pointers at the same rate that Barry did. Houston also had a hard time moving defensively after his knee injuries. At 6'3"" [**Terry Porter**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/portete01.html) primarily played PG, but also shot nearly 40 percent for his career from downtown and got to the line frequently.

Looking at some forwards, you could say that [**Sam Perkins**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/perkisa01.html) extended his career by developing a 3-point shot at age 32. While Sam was never really a focal point of his team's offense, this early ""stretch four"" forced opponents to extend defensive coverage. This created opportunities in the paint for teammates in Seattle (Gary Payton, Shawn Kemp, Detlef Schrempf) and Indiana (Rik Smits, Dale Davis, Antonio Davis).

[**Danny Ferry**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/f/ferryda01.html) also had multiple seasons where he shot nearly 40 percent from beyond the arc with over 200 attempts. Stretching the defense created opportunities for other excellent three-point shooters on those mid-90's Cleveland teams, like Mark Price, Chris Mills, Bobby Phills, etc.

It's a little tougher to gauge statistically how effective so-called defensive specialists would be in the modern game, but it's safe to say players like [**Sidney Moncrief**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/moncrsi01.html)**,** [**Joe Dumars,**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/dumarjo01.html) [**Michael Cooper**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/coopemi01.html)**,** and [**Dennis Johnson**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/johnsde01.html) could be even more valued today (even if they're a little on the shorter side). With a serviceable 3-point shot, any of those players could have had even more successful careers than they did, though all are obviously quite accomplished.

1688,693,Danny Green's advanced stats are really good,"Danny averaged 10.3/4.0/1.3/0.9/0.7 last season, aka, very decent role player raw numbers (albeit on awesome efficiency - 47/46/84 splits, 63TS%, +7 rTS%), and his box-score based advanced metrics,  similarly, weren't too flashy but very solid- 0.128 WS/48, 2.9 BPM, 2.7 VORP.

His **plus minus-based advanced stats**, however, were off the charts, keeping in mind that he was very much a role-player (albeit an important one) for the Raptors last season:

RPM- 4.73, **13th**

PIPM- 3.9, **17th**

(Wins added, based on PIPM - 11.6, **15th**)

RAPM- **2nd**

**How did this happen? Did he really have star-level impact as a role player? Was it really just because he played in a winning environment? Was his defense and shooting (and everything else that Danny Green does on the court) simply that valuable?**

Note: this wasn't necessarily just a one-off thing, he's had other years with good-to-incredible advanced stats despite only having decent raw production on great efficiency. He's benefited from always playing in winning environments, but this year-after-year excellence has followed him throughout most of his career.

E.g. 2014-15 season, possibly his best individual season, he averaged 12/4/2/1.2/1.1 on 60TS% (+6 rTS%), great numbers but not what we generally consider superstar production.

His advanced numbers that season though, were incredible (both box-score based *and* plus-minus based ones, this time): 0.163 WS/48, 5.0 BPM (**11th**), 4.1 VORP (**15th**), 5.4 RPM (**12th**), 4.77 RAPM (**16th**), 3.53 Luck-adjusted RAPM (**30th**). These are all-star numbers!",nbadiscussion
1689,694,"[Lowe] Predicting who wins a tight, tense NBA Finals","http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26836181/predicting-wins-tight-tense-nba-finals

Good article on dissecting the match ups in the series. Please read the whole thing. It's a good primer.

Generally I believe the match ups are fairly even but what can swing the series is what is mentioned below:

> The Raptors have a lot of answers. They have home court. Maybe in getting this far, they shed the mental yips that pockmarked their play at times before the Milwaukee series -- the bouts of hot-potato timidity from Lowry and Gasol.


> But the pressure of the Finals is new, more intense. Golden State has lived it many times over. The Warriors are ready. Part of them is excited to start on the road. After all these years, they crave new challenges.

I would go as far to say that if they shoot like they did on open shots games 1-3 of the ECF they will have trouble. 

Here are my two points of emphasis from the article.

**1**

> To beat even the non-Durant Warriors, you have to be able to switch the Curry-Green pick-and-roll. That is just a fundamental truth now.

The hard part about this one is the Cavs won in 2016 not doing this. They doubled Curry, chose the 3 that weren't HB on the 4 on 3 and prayed HB would miss. Generally I believe switching everything (including off ball) similar to the Rockets the past two years and OKC in 2016 is the best way to defend this version of the Warriors however the teams are still entranced by the doubles when Durant isn't playing - see Rockets at the end of Game 5 and Game 6 this year. If Curry starts tearing the centers up like he did to TT in 2015, 2017 and 2018 and Adams in 2016 then he may force the Raptors into 'letting the other guys beat you' via the Draymond 4 on 3. That will take a lot of the Raptors defense skill out of the equation and lead to more chaos which GSW thrives on.



**2**

> Toronto's role players will need to hit open 3s, though they might not get as many naked looks this time around.

This is really where that game or 2 swing comes into play. If the Raptors shoot like Game 1 through 3 of that Bucks series this will be over fast. If they get 2 of Gasol, FVV, Ibaka or Green hitting close to their season averages it will be a series.",nbadiscussion

1691,696,[OC] How these Nets came to be: an in-depth analysis of the Billy King and Sean Marks Eras,"Longtime lurker and lifetime Nets fan here. I posted this in /r/nba to give outsiders an in-depth overview of the organization's recent history, but sadly it got buried. So, at the suggestion of some in the /r/GoNets sub, I decided to bring it here. I hope this overview of Billy King and Sean Marks’ tenures as Nets GM helps to explain the larger shape of the franchise's moves over the past decade and what is just now becoming a success story for the league.

**The Billy King Era and the Fall of the Monarchy**

King’s tenure as GM was littered with poor trades. Ever prior to the infamous Celtics trade, the Nets set themselves down a path toward ‘contention’ that would require compounding suspect moves with even more suspect moves to keep improving the roster in what often turned out to be marginal ways at high costs. One could argue this was in large part the result of new owner, Russian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov, who after taking over the team in 2011, 1) demanded instant contention, 2) was willing to spend unprecedented amounts in luxury tax to get there, and 3) had little understanding of the overall NBA landscape.

**Deron Williams**

In some ways, it all begins with the Deron Williams trade. Upon missing out on Carmelo Anthony at the 2010-2011 trade deadline, the Nets surprised the basketball world, trading Devin Harris, Derrick Favors, and two (unprotected) first round draft picks (NJ 2011, GS 2012) for all-star Deron Williams. While lauded at the time, this deal would create organizational pressure to both re-sign Williams as a FA and build a contender around him, leading to multiple haphazard moves (see below). Worst of all, ankle injuries sapped Williams of his effectiveness on the court (not to mention questionable effort and leadership). Whether the Nets realized it or not, their front office was going all in on a sunk cost.

**Gerald Wallace**

In terms of the logic at the time, the ensuing 2012 trade for Gerald Wallace might have been EVEN WORSE than the Celtics trade. Already in a lost season, the Nets acquired Gerald “Crash” Wallace prior to the 2011-12 trade deadline from the Trail Blazers for Mehmet Okur, Shawne Williams and their own (top-3 protected) 2012 first-round pick. The goal was to convince impending FA Deron Williams that the Nets were committed to building a winner moving forward. Of course, Gerald Wallace himself was an impending FA and the Nets ended up massively overpaying him in the offseason (4/40) to ensure he stuck around. Not only was Wallace terrible for almost his entire tenure as a Net, but that pick would become #6 overall selection Damian Lillard (we should of course not assume the Nets would have picked him). In short, why the hell would you trade a 1st round pick for an impending free agent in a lost season, only to then pay him more than anyone else would in FA anyway?

**Joe Johnson**

This Joe Johnson trade was not in and of itself that problematic. The Nets in essence absorbed Joe Johnson, still a very good player, as a salary dump from the Hawks. While no doubt overpaid with the largest contract in the NBA (6/123.7), Johnson was a strong contributor for the Nets, helping them make 3 playoff appearances and earning the nickname Joe Jesus as a result of his consistent clutch shooting. There were, however, two long-term ramifications to this trade: 1) the Nets cap-strapped themselves so that all future major additions would need to be by trade (setting up the Celtic trade); and 2) the Nets, at the last second, agreed to the Hawks added request for a 1st round pick swap, which would lead to swapping the 15th overall pick for the 30th in the 2015 draft.

**Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce**

The most infamous trade, of course, was the 2014 Celtics trade. The Celtics sent Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, Jason Terry and D.J. White to the Nets in exchange for five players plus the Nets’ (unprotected!) first-round picks in 2014, 2016 and 2018 AND the rights to swap first-round picks in 2017. After one second-round playoff run, Williams, Johnson, Garnett, and Pierce rapidly declined and the Nets had almost no choice but to get out of the luxury tax and begin a rebuild. In turn, these picks became a gold mine for the Celtics and the foundation of their rebuild, producing picks #17 (2014), #3 (2016), #1 (2017), and #8 (2018).

**Summary/TLDR**: Even prior to the Celtics trade, which deprived them of all meaningful post-2013 assets, the Nets had traded away most of their prior draft picks and young players in order to pursue contention in trades for Deron Williams, Gerald Wallace, and Joe Johnson. The Celtics trade was thus the culmination of a desire to win at ALL costs and a set of compounding bad trades/signings to (try to) do so. Unlike say Hinkie then, Marks would begin his tenure with very few tradable assets, virtually no draft picks, no young players to build around AND huge contracts that put them in the luxury tax. It is not an exaggeration to say this might have been the worst situation in pro sports history for a GM to come into.

**The Sean Marks Era and the rise of Marksism**

**Early TLDR**; In taking over as GM, Marks sought to institute a number of major strategies: 1) recognizing the past trades as sunk costs that would not affect present deals; 2) using players not part of the long-term future and the cap space that would open up to acquire all possible draft picks; 3) hiring a young-ish modern offense coach that the franchise could build around and emphasizing player development as THE key coaching goal; 4) increasing organizational scouting and drafting high upside players with question marks at later points in the draft as well as finding under appreciated players in the G League/on waivers; and 5) creating a high character, players-first culture that would (at least theoretically) create appeal around the league.

**Coaching:**

In one of his first moves as GM, Marks hired Kenny Atkinson in 2016 as head coach. Based on his experience as an assistant coach with the Hawks, Atkinson was thought of as a modern offense-oriented coach who would stress high volume high percentage shots in the paint and from beyond the arc (which has turned out to be true, e.g. 6th in 3p FGA and 5th in 3p FGM). Atkinson came under some fire his first two years for not adapting his system to his players (e.g. having a dearth of 3pt shooting). But the goal was always to institute the system first and then build the roster to fit it.

Atkinson also had a strong reputation for player development, which has become a notable strongpoint for the Nets (e.g. the emergence Dinwiddie, Harris, Allen, and Russell), not to mention he has helped revive the careers of Carroll, Dudley and other veterans. Importantly, Marks made it clear that there was no immediate pressure to win. The goal was to create a sustainable system, build a high character/high effort culture, and develop unheralded or undervalued young players for contention well down the line.

**Trading and More:**

It is a common misconception that the Nets have had NO first round draft picks during the post-Celtics trade era when in fact they have had a first round pick (albeit non-lottery) every year. With that said, it would be useful to go through some of the ‘major’ transaction since the Nets hired Marks in April, 2016.

After finally getting rid of their pre-Marks albatross contracts, the Nets made it a priority to use their cap space to absorb bad contracts for draft picks and high upside young players as well as to trade players who were not in their long term plans (e.g. Brooklyn Lopez, Thaddeus Young, Bojan Bogdanovic) for assets. Acknowledging the sunk cost of the Celtics trade, Marks did this without regard for how bad it would make the team in the present nor how good it would make the Celtics’ draft picks. Notable signings/trades include:

December, 2016: Signed [Spencer Dinwiddie](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/dinwisp01.html) to a multi-year contract.

February, 2017: Traded [Bojan Bogdanovic](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bogdabo02.html) and [Chris McCullough](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mcculch01.html) to the [Washington Wizards](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/WAS/2017.html) for [Andrew Nicholson](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/n/nichoan01.html), [Marcus Thornton](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/thornma01.html) and a 2017 1st round draft pick ([Jarrett Allen](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/allenja01.html) was later selected).

June, 2017: Traded [Kyle Kuzma](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/k/kuzmaky01.html) and [Brook Lopez](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/lopezbr01.html) to the [Los Angeles Lakers](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/2017.html) for [Timofey Mozgov](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mozgoti01.html) and [D'Angelo Russell](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/russeda01.html).

July, 2017: Traded [Justin Hamilton](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hamilju01.html) to the [Toronto Raptors](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/TOR/2018.html) for [DeMarre Carroll](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/carrode01.html), a 2018 1st round draft pick ([Dzanan Musa](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/musadz01.html) was later selected) and a 2018 2nd round draft pick ([Rodions Kurucs](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/k/kurucro01.html) was later selected).

July, 2017: Traded [Andrew Nicholson](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/n/nichoan01.html) to the [Portland Trail Blazers](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/POR/2018.html) for [Allen Crabbe](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/crabbal01.html).

Their moves have not all been home runs. The offer sheets to restricted free agents like Allen Crabbe and Otto Porter were somewhat ridiculous at the time, though they did in the end effectively hamper the matching teams’ cap situations and innovated just how poisonous a pill could be. The subsequent trade for Crabbe was also problematic in that he has dealt with injuries, produced below expectations, and his $18.5 million player option for 2019-20 is sure to hamper the Nets in FA or cost them assets to get rid of.

**Drafting:**

Importantly, these trades were complemented by a massive expansion of the Nets’ scouting infrastructure, especially in Europe. If the Nets were going pick outside the lottery, the goal would be to try to hit home runs by drafting high upside athletic players with questions surrounding health or skillset. They would then trust their player development and medical teams to get the most out of those high risk, high reward players. This was made easier by the fact that, unlike many teams picking in the back half of the 1st round, there was no pressure to simply get low-risk complementary role players for an already-good roster.

Without going through every pick, it’s worth highlighting how this philosophy manifested in a few cases.

1. Acquired through the Thaddeus Young trade with the Pacers, the Nets used the 2016 #20 pick on Caris Levert. There were many questions about Levert’s ability to stay healthy and whether he would ever reach his potential after dealing with multiple season-ending foot injuries at Michigan. The Nets, however, believed that Levert was a high-lottery level talent and were more than willing to take the risk at #20. Since then, while Levert has dealt with some injuries, he has begun to show flashes of star-potential and was on the fast track to Most Improved Player before dislocating his ankle.
2. Acquired in the Bojan Bogdanovic trade with the Wizards, the Nets selected Jarett Allen with the #22 pick in the 2017 draft. While there were questions about Allen’s effort and skillset, the Nets believed that he had Gobert-esque potential and claimed to have had him rated much higher than 22 on their board. Lo and behold, Allen has become one of the most promising young centers in the league, blocking seemingly countless superstars around the league at the rim and showing an excellent knack for rolling to the rim on offense.
3. With the #40 pick in the 2018 draft - acquired from the Raptors in the DeMarre Carrol trade - the Nets selected relative unknown Latvian, Rodions Kurucs. While Kurucs had spent two years languishing on the bench for Barcelona's B team after refusing to commit to the franchise long-term, the Nets had been scouting him for YEARS in Europe and believed he had the potential to be a truly diverse, impactful NBA talent. While most teams probably did not even have him on their draft board, the Nets had him rated above his selection spot (#40) and he is already proving to be a solid NBA player at 20 years old with the ability to drive, defend, and shoot. His versatility has been a big part of the Nets’ recent run.

**Player Development:**

In addition to the draft, the Nets also acquired under appreciated and undervalued assets such as D’Angelo Russell, Spencer Dinwiddie, and Joe Harris. The Nets believed that teams were giving up on these players too early and their development staffs were failing to maximize their potential. While Russell is finally making a/the leap and making a last minute all-star bid, Dinwiddie has become one of if not the best 6th men in the NBA and Harris has become one of its best 3pt shooters (47.5% on 5.1 attempts per game). While luck always plays a factor and not every such move has worked out, few teams have been as committed to or as good at finding and developing unheralded players as the Nets.

**Culture:**

Besides talking up a strong team culture based on high-end training facilities, frequent team events, and player-friendly coaching, the Nets have also made a strong effort to acquire high-character and high effort veterans like Carroll, Davis, Dudley, and Napier (just to name a few), who can mentor the young players and set the tone in the locker room. I am not sure that any team in the league has less off court drama and plays harder on a nightly basis than the Nets. It remains to be seen whether this cultural component will have any real appeal to players around the league.

**Future Outlook:**

In many ways the Nets success is relative to their prior bleak circumstances. Their current record is 26-23 playing in the Eastern Conference and it is worth acknowledging that they have THE hardest schedule in the NBA down the stretch with 12/13 games against teams currently over .500 (including 9 of them on the road) to close out the season. Furthermore, there are questions about whether the current foundation in place is one that is/will be able to compete for a championship down the line. Will any of the young core become a true superstar (e.g. Russell, Levert) and/or will the Nets be able to add one (or two) stars in free agency?

The Nets core is extremely young, but the cap situation will not remain open forever. Given the need to pay Russell this offseason (most reporters speculate they will), the albatross that is Crabbe’s contract ($18.5 million), and the need to re-sign Harris and Levert in the not-too-distant future, I would say the window is not as long as one might suspect. A LOT hinges on the Nets ability to attract a marquee free agent this offseason and/or next when it comes to the path towards legitimate championship contention. But even if the Nets cannot sign a tier-1 FA like Durant, Leonard, or Irving, reports suggest they will have strong interest in Tobias Harris (who would be a GREAT fit at the 4 in Atkinson’s system). Furthermore, if they are able to trade an asset to unload Crabbe into another team’s cap space (oh how the turns have tabled!), they could have close to $45-50 million to spend (even accounting for a $20 million AAV Russell extension).

While missing out on superstar FAs may put the Nets in a bit of NBA ‘purgatory’, I think most Nets fans would still be grateful to have a team that consistently makes the playoffs and continues to bet on smart drafting and player development to take them to the next level. When you have survived what we have, 45-50 wins would be an incredible feeling. I mean just look how we are reacting to being above .500!

1692,697,The 76ers 11-point loss to the Bucks tonight actually felt more confidence-inspiring than the previous three games.,"I don't know why, but this game gave me more confidence in the Sixers than the previous three did. Embiid is going to come back to form. Even with his sluggishness, his shooting is not that bad. He makes about 50% more of his shots than he did tonight without his hand being wrapped. Burks and Robinson are going to get so many open looks from three and will drastically improve the horrid offense, even if it's just by making their shots. JRich is set to come back. He always plays with the Mamba mentality and is so good at the PnR with Ben. His outside shooting and especially his great defense will be a MAJOR upgrade heading forward. With all of their problems tonight, including the fact that Philly shot 22% from midrange, that 11-point loss (smallest of the losing streak) seems like a better place to be for this team than the previous three games. Finally, they have the easiest schedule for the remainder of the season. Will it be enough to move up to the 2 or 3 seed? Probably not. But moving up a seed or two can definitely help this team build confidence and chemistry down the stretch. Sorry for the tangent.

1693,698,"The best and most simple fix for ""The NBA regular season is boring"" discussion...","It looks like Silver is serious about fixing the NBA regular season.  It also looks like his ideas are pretty meh.

Here's the proper fix.

16 teams make the playoffs.  Top 7 teams get to draft which opponent (8-16) they want to play in the first round.  1 seed has first pick, 2nd seed gets second pick and so on and so forth.

The NBA can make an hourlong special out of this.  It would give fans and all the talking heads something interesting to talk about before the playoffs begin.

Round 2, same thing happens.  Teams ranked 1-3 get to choose who they want to play in the second round.

This makes being a fan of those second and third tier teams much more interesting with teams fighting for that 7th seed.  It also puts pressure on players like Kawhi Leonard not to rest too many games as seeding now matters.

Who doesn't like this 10x better than the goofy mid season tournaments they're planning?",nbadiscussion
1694,699,What do we think of the roster Kevin Pritchard has built in Indy?,"Homer Post Incoming, but I was looking at the Pacers roster (and salivating) and I noticed that as far as construction and cap space is concerned, the Pacers might have the best position in the league.

PG: Malcolm Brogdon - 26, signed@ 85mil thru '23

SG: Victor Oladipo - 27, signed@ 85mil thru '21

SF: T.J. Warren - 26, signed@ 47mil thru '22

PF: Domantas Sabonis - 23 signed@ 74.9mil thru '24

C: Myles Turner - 23, signed@ 80mil thru '23

A full starting 5 signed until 2021 with the oldest player at 27. Additionally, the bench is signed to a series of excellent value-to-contribution contracts. 

[Here's a multi-year look at the 'Cers cap sheet.](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/indiana-pacers/yearly/cap/)

For better or for worse, these are the Pacers until about 2022

What do we think of the roster Kevin Pritchard has constructed? Pacers fans have certainly come to appreciate the mix of intelligence and athleticism Brogdon/McConnell have brought to the PG position, and we're paying a combined 36m/yr for Domas and Myles which *miiight* be the best bang-for-your-buck-baFrontcourt in the NBA right now. 

Is there a better roster in the NBA that combines current effectiveness with upside, all while retaining a good value down the line? 

Perhaps more importantly: Indy will never be able to sign a marquee free agent, so is this roster good enough to eventually win a chip? If not, what moves do the Pacers need to make to take that next step?


**EDIT**: The Pacers have only drafted in the top 10 once in the past 20 years, and that was PG. Brogdon is *the* biggest FA signing in team history. With MVP caliber players and top-5 guys out of the question - how would a small market team like the Pacers actually build a real contender?",nbadiscussion
1695,700,Do you think the Eastern Conference will be worse than the Western Conference in perpetuity?,"It's no secret that the Western Conference is stronger than the Eastern Conference. Why do you think this is? Personally, I think it's simply that NBA players want to live in CA so, if they are the elite of the elite, they often sign in CA. Kawhi, LeBron, Durant, Anthony Davis (forced a trade), Paul George (forced a trade) all made their way to California. There's a reason why all time great players such as Kobe, Shaq, Steph Curry, Kareem, Wilt, Magic etc. all played either part of their career or all of their career in California. NBA players are generally more liberal than NFL athletes plus I feel like NBA players hate cold weather more than other athletes. 

Do you think the Eastern Conference will always be worse than the Western Conference due to the California factor as well as the weather advantages that the West has?",nbadiscussion
1696,701,Will we look back on this era as the three point era?,"

https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dygi48/players_arent_just_a_3_number_slash_line_and/

The discussion in this post got me thinking - wow some of these teams are just beautifully constructed for superstars. 5 out and 4 out 1 in offences are very prevalent and with the spacing they provide they make for very efficient offensive production with NBA defence at it's current state. Imagine 09 Lebron's or 00 Shaq's numbers on the 18-19 Milwaukee in place of Giannis. But as we move in to the next era it seems doubtful that the 3 point shot will go away - instead there will probably be an evolution in how offences are run to produce 3's. Basically I'm claiming the rest of NBA time could be the 3 point era with out rule changes, to call this the 3 point era is probably not specific enough, it's simply because we are in the era we do not know what to name it. I believe these next few seasons will bring much experimentation since there are so many contenders and near contenders as well. This could bring a clear step forward in the game and help us clarify what this time has been.",nbadiscussion
1697,702,"The wise words of Pascal Siakam ""taking what the defense gives me.""","His first comment in the video ""taking what the defense gives me.""  Initially it sounds simple enough but puts a cap on his claim for most improved player in the NBA this past year.  Taking what the defense gives you is an old saying that goes back generations.  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXjMuexQ7s8

A few things are needed for his strategy to work and it goes back to an older saying:  good players take what the defense gives them and are able to do something with it; great players take what they want.  This is not a knock on Pascal but a compliment as a player.  Every player has to get past step one (taking what is given them) to become great.  

To me 'taking what the defense gives you' means the defense is going to deny your greatest strength - whether that's driving to the right or left, whatever.  And being able to recognize what the defense is giving up (maybe the d is giving up a mid range, pull up jumper or just a straight pull up).  Normally it means the d is denying a drive one way or the other; and the d gives up the jump shot (hands down, man down) over the top.  It can mean the d is funneling all drives toward help and giving up anything that direction.  Yet, whatever is being given up by the d is able to be recognized by Siakam and he's developed his game to the point where he can still be effective.  For instance, the d may be giving up a straight shot but is denying the drive.  Pascal is able to recognize this and simply take the shot and be effective. 

It will be interesting to watch Siakam the rest of the playoffs and see what Golden State is giving up.  That may change over the course of the finals.  Perhaps GS decides to start giving up the drive in order to hope for a trap.  Pascal will have to show the ability to take these drives and be productive at being able to pass out of them or simply continue trying to score (drives and pull ups or straight pull ups).  

Either way, the ability to have a viable mid range game is key to all this.  Being able to be a triple threat offensively - especially having a quick and accurate mid range jumper or pull up shot- allows Pascal to take what the defense gives him and do something with it. We'll see Game 2 what adjustments are made by the two sides.",nbadiscussion

1699,704,How to fix the NBA rules interpretation/manipulation which is ruining basketball,"Watched the Raptors and Sixers game last night, and again the refereeing was forced under the spotlight. The refs looked genuinely overwhelmed and stressed out and I​ for one actually​ don't blame the​m (I do however blame Tony Brothers) The interpretation of the rules seem to keep changing and the pace of the modern game rarely allows them to get clean looks. 

As a basketball fan and player for over 30 years,  I no longer have a clear idea of what constitutes a foul as it is so wildly inconsistent.​​ Is the hand apart of the ball, what is the rule for kicking out feet on a jump shot vs. safe landing, what constitutes verticality and a foul, over the back, overzealous dribble handoff screens vs fighting through screens? As frustrated as I am as a fan, I can't imagine how the players feel.​

Draymond Green's comments post Game 1 against the Rockets about refereeing being an inexact science is 100% accurate but puts 100% of the onus on the refs which is a third of the issue as players are also interpreting and manipulating the rules to gain an advantage and the league is not supporting and enforcing definitive criteria and understanding of the rule calling to either sides. 

In short the NBA has a ​HUGE​ problem. ​Missed calls are understandable, blown calls due to individual interpretation and refuting calls based on bias and misunderstanding of rules are not. ​

I did not feel the same frustration watching NCAA tournament games.  My explanation is the unspoken respect allowed to college refs that has disappeared in the NBA. This manifests in the back and forth between players and referees, pressure for special star treatment and constant calls for rule changes game to game. 

The continuous in game dialogs and post game rants in the NBA ​​cannot​ be allowed to​ continue. Both sides need to take responsibility and collaborate. The league needs to intervene and institute pre game, in game and post game improvement mechanism​s​ devoid of any individual pressure or influence. 

​

My suggested solution:   


\- Take all rules in the play book and run an annual NBA Rules training camp in the offseason. Require all NBA referees/refs in training AND two members of each NBA team to participate. The training camp will clearly identify and demonstrate what the practical criteria for what constitutes a foul in different situations and give a clear set of expectations for each side as a foundation to understanding how games will be called.  The goal is a mutually created and simplified rule calling criteria and allow all stakeholders including fans to understand how games will be called

\- The goal is to diffuse the us vs. them mentality pervading the league. No more Star rules, regular season vs playoff rules, no more 4th quarter rules, no more make up calls.  Just THE rules. This is the ""fair chance"" Harden was pleading for whether rightly or wrongly and what all involved need to strive for.

\- The two team ""Rules Ambassadors"" will be responsible for disseminating the rules and training their respective teams.

\- During the pre-season schedule this effort will be supported as each team will have a lead NBA referee be required to work directly with a randomly selected NBA team and to review the preseason games and reinforce the rule calling criteria via actual game play examples. 

\- The goal is to allow engagement and dialog between the refs and the players outside of a critical win-lose environment. 

\- Each teams' Rules Ambassadors will be their team's only point of contact to refute calls post game. No more belittling the refs about it. NO more reporters baiting players and coaches.  This isn't to say players cannot voice respectful displeasure or refute a call in the moment but, no chatting and pulling refs aside for pow wows and no screaming, bumping or harassment. No more subjectiveness by the refs on behaviour levels before a technical is called or senseless ejection issued. Keep chirping and you are gone.

\- As an evolution of the L2M reporting, the NBA will continuously monitor and allow for teams' Rules Ambassadors to submit reviews of their games and get clear empirical feedback to support the establishment of mutually beneficial ""standard"" calls. The goal is to have the Team Ambassadors is not only to champion a team but, also act as a support in refuting their own players claims of injustice based on the detailed criteria and provide further rules training as required. The flipside will be league tracking of invalid players ""flopping"" and invalid arguing of calls with regular offenders subject to penalty and/or suspension and mandatory additional rules training.  All findings will be shared and accessible by all stakeholders. 

\- Likewise the league monitoring will identify needed support and training to the referee crews as to improve consistency of game calling and persistent repeat offenders will be subject to suspension.  
\- Any NBA mandated ruling changes in or post season will require involvement and approval by a clear majority of the NBA board of team owners or the collective of the teams' Rules Ambassadors. Sufficient time for the requisite additional training of refs and players will be mandatory.

\- The ingame change I would make is to allow for one challenge per a half from the coaches. If the challenge is validated then they get to use it again that half. Any challenge that is not valid results in the loss of the challenge. The challenge system, will be supported by real time active VAR (Virtual Assistant Referee) staff out of NYC HQ to limit the amount of time reviewing a challenge takes. 

&#x200B;

As lover of the game, the only way to win is to improve the game together with the refs, league and teams.

1701,706,My solution to tanking: Proxy Draft,"The NBA has tried to solve the league-wide trend of tanking or intentionally creating terrible rosters to get the best chance in the lottery. Teams have actually tanked decades before but was only popularized during the ""Process"" era in Philly. You may have your opinions about tanking but the bottom line is more losses=better pick. Adams Silvers solution was equalizing the chances of the bottom tier teams, but in reality, the ideology of tanking still exists since teams will naturally still try to tank to the bottom 5. As NBA fans we may understand the ""bigger picture"" but for casual sports fans, they'd probably consider the NBA as a 2-3 team league with shitty franchises that doesn't prioritize winning. What makes a better product is a league where ALL teams compete year after year while still being able to develop a core and foundation for winning.


My solution is the Proxy draft. The general idea is that the worst team in the league gets the first chance to pick another team to represent them in the lottery, then the 2nd worst gets to pick etc etc. So lets say the Hawks end up with the worst record, Schlenk now gets to decide what team has the best chances of getting a terrible record by the end of the season. Now the Hawks select the Knicks as their proxy, so by the end of the year, the Knicks now end up with the worst record in the league and their lottery chances now transfer to the Hawks.


What we have here is system that no longer incentivizes tanking since the burden of losing to get a better pick for Team A is now given to Team B. At the same time Team B will obviously have no interest in giving Team A a good pick when in fact it forces them to try and win even more games. Now teams will no longer intentionally try and build GLeague lineups like the Process 76ers during the offseason since it would no longer benefit them but Team B.



The biggest question then is when does the proxy draft take place? It cant be during the start of the season cause it would be too volatile and there'd be too many unknown factors in terms of injuries,trades,development etc to make an educated pick. It cant be before the trade deadline since again, what if the Knicks successfully trade for Kawhi Leonard after they were selected as a proxy, therefore ruining the Hawks chances? This is up for debate but imo it is best held somewhere between the end of the trade deadline and the end of February so teams now have a knowledgeable outlook of where opposing teams are in the standings while also lowering the chances of sudden surprises (like Miami Heats 2nd half of the 2017 season). This is also the period when teams go ""full tank mode"" since they would no longer have any chances of making the playoffs.


The Proxy Draft can also bring unprecedented storylines, rivalries, excitement, any hype all across the league. It could be a National TV event that could even rival the real NBA Draft since we would see 1st hand reactions of GM's or representatives being selected as proxy for team rivals. Who else would want to see Steph shake his head when the Warriors are selected as the proxy for the Knicks?



Thanks for taking the time, and I'd like to hear your thoughts cause I truly think this has the potential to change the out course of the NBA.",nbadiscussion
1702,707,What should be the Pelicans' starting line up next season?,"In a very exciting year for this franchise, a lot of prospects will be fighting for minutes in the league but they seem like an awkward fit.

Player by player, the starting 5 seems to be Lonzo-Jrue-Zion-Ingram-Favors, but that lineup lacks spacing and would fill the lane a lot (but would be amazing defensively). An alternative is playing Reddick at the 2 and move Jrue to the PG, relegating Lonzo to the bench, but Lonzo is the kind of player that improves a lot if he has talented scorers around him. Another option is starting Melli at the PF position and have Ingram be a scoring option in the bench, where he would be surrounded by good shooters and have the ball in his hands a lot, but Melli is not NBA proven yet and most probably not ready to be a starter.

What are your prefered lineups for Pelicans' next season?",nbadiscussion
1703,708,[Discussion] Jalen Green going to the G-league versus College,"Wanted to see what people view as the pros and cons of a** top tier** prospect eschewing college for the G-league.

Edit: there are no cons to this? Everyone is just arguing against my points...

It seems that a lot of people have been saying the NCAA is screwed and the G-league offer is competitive... Aside from the NBA going back to a HS-graduate eligible draft in a few years, I wanted a play a little devil's advocate to the cons of skipping college for g-league (keep in mind this is only applicable to a top tier prospect):

- **Miss out on the college experience, and work immediately with pros** - It's pretty well known that there are plenty of journeymen that use the G-league to get back into the league. They might harbor some sort of resentment to have a younger stud taking their playing time and this could lead to poor development and chemistry issues. In college, the new recruit likely comes in as top dog and his teammates automatically respect that (and some even signed on because of said top prospect). Look back at when the NBA had high schoolers in their drafts, the great ones were truly transcendental (Kobe, KG, Tmac) but other likes Darius Miles, Jonathan Bender, etc., didn't exactly pan out. 

- **College campus versus fly over cities** - No disrespect to the G-league cities, but they're generally smaller and secondary to the larger markets they are tied to. While college campuses reside on mostly smaller cities, they are at least the main source of attraction there and they would be filled with individuals of similar age.

- **A legacy in college is better than one in the G-league** - Look at Carmelo's legacy at 'Cuse. He brought them to the chip in his one year and he will forever be revered on campus. If you take a G-league team to the championship, that's probably not going on your HoF resume (assuming the coach isn't cutting your minutes because they're saving you for the main league). Look at MLB for example, very few people talk about minor league championships.

- **Probably gets paid in college plus scholarship is available down the road** - First, the prospect probably get similar pay from college boosters. Second, it seems that you can always go back to your alma mater once your playing career ends, e.g. Shaq graduating from LSU in 2000. Also, while the G-league is giving out college scholarships, the prospect might not be able to choose where he goes for school. Let's say the prospect flames out of the league, he is a millionaire but that's probably not enough money to ""donate"" and enroll in any school they wanted. The top prospect could be missing out on a great education from Duke, Virginia or Michigan or any of the top tier scholastic/athletic schools.",nbadiscussion

1705,710,Wilt Chamberlains 50ppg season adjusted for pace (with actual pace adjustment),"There was a recent post on this sub claiming to adjust Wilt's '62 season for pace, but it accomplished this using Wilt's portion of team stats which is only loosely related to pace. The post had other errors such as claiming Wilt grabbed 24% of available rebounds (when the actual number was around 18%) and ignoring FTs. This motivated me to make a more accurate pace adjustment.

**Wilt's '62 season adjusted to '19 pace and available rebounds**

BRef does not list pace prior to '74 on their [league averages page](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats.html), but they do list pace on the [individual yearly summary page](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1962.html). The Philadelphia Warriors in '62 had a pace of 131.1 possessions per 48 minutes, compared to this season's league average of 99.5. To adjust Wilt's stats to a modern pace we simply multiply by the ratio of the pace between the seasons, which is 99.5/131.1 = 0.759

To also adjust for available rebounds we use rebounds per possession. '62 had an average of 71.4 rebs per 126.4 possessions, or 0.565 rebs per poss. '19 has 44.9 rebs per 99.5 poss, or 0.451 rebs per poss. This gives us an available reb per poss ratio of 0.799.

Putting this all together gives us the following table:

||Points/g|Rebounds/g|Assists/g|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Wilt '62|50.4|25.7|2.4|
|Adjusted to '19 pace|38.3|15.6|1.8|

**Wilt's '62 season adjusted to '19 pace, available rebounds, and MPG**

No player in the league today is capable of averaging 48.5 MPG as Wilt did in '62. However many have claimed that while the pace was higher in '62, the actual distance ran per minute was significantly less. This is quite noticeable in the following footage of Wilt in the '67 ECF:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yffDCHu4X0

Notice how Wilt rarely moves at all in the half court on offense or defense and rarely moves faster than a jog in transition. Many modern players could average 48.5 MPG at this rate of movement. 

If we adjust his minutes per game to 37.5, which would lead the league this season (Harden currently leads MPG at 37.4), this gives us a minutes ratio of 37.5/48.5 = 0.773. Applying this yields the following result:

||Points/g|Rebounds/g|Assists/g|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Wilt '62|50.4|25.7|2.4|
|Adjusted to '19 pace|38.3|15.6|1.8|
|Adj '19 pace and MPG|29.6|12.1|1.4

1706,711,"Is this a realistic trade possibility to cover the needs of the 76ers, Cavs, and Blazers before the deadline?","Though I think some kinks can be worked out and Al Horford can provide more positive value for Philly, if they were to go the trade route with him could they also deal with ither teams looking for help such as the Cavs and Blazers? Kevin Love made it clear last night he is not happy in Cleveland. His potential fit with the Blazers has been said time and time again. Adding Horford to the deal would allow the Blazers a great under the basket defender and smart veteran. The Cavs would receive good young talent in Hassan Whiteside, while also receiving developing players in Jonah Bolden and Zhaire Smith. They also receive draft compensation. Philly would receive that coveted perimeter shooter with playmaking abilities in CJ McCollum. Also, if the Blazers are all-in on Anfernee Simons, as is indicated, this would allow him to be slotted next to Dame and provide one of the most lethal backcourts in a few years.

* **Sixers receive:** CJ McCollum

* **Cavs receive:** Hassan Whiteside, Zhaire Smith, Jonah Bolden, Portland 2020 1st Round Pick, Philly 2020 1st Round Pick (via OKC; likely will become a 2nd round pick)

1707,712,Can we talk about how bad the Westbrook/Chris Paul trade has been for Houston so far? A synopsis:,"The Rockets gave up Chris Paul, 2024 and 2026 firsts and pick swaps in 2021 and 2025 for Russell Westbrook.

So far Chris Paul is have a really strong year putting up 15/4/6/2 with 45/38/87 (59..5 TS%). To go along with Paul’s efficient offense he has been incredible defensively especially considering his age. His IQ and motor on defense has really impressed. 

Westbrook has struggled mightily on the other hand. Statistically so far his numbers are 22/8/7/2 with 40/22/74 (47.7!!! TS%). Westbrook is playing with one of the best offensive players in the NBA and the most spacing he has (ever?) had and is still playing awful on offense even while Harden is getting so much attention. Teams are ignoring him and sending 2 guys at Harden consistently. His defense has been at best below average this year and when you play next to Harden you need to really bring it on that end because Harden is not going to put in the effort.

On top of the Rockets giving up 2 firsts + 2 pick swaps they took on an additional year of salary with Westbrook’s contract (47 million in his final year).

In sum the rockets gave up 2 firsts, 2 pick swaps and Chris Paul for Westbrook and his extra year under contract where he’ll make 47 million.

I understand it is early but I feel that if the rockets could have kept Paul and used those picks in another way they would look like very strong title contenders along with LAx2, MIL, ect. ect.",nbadiscussion

Accolades w/Team: 7 Finals Appearances, 6x NBA Champion, 1x NBA MVP, 13x All-Star, 2x All-Star Game MVP, 10x All-NBA 1st Team, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 18.5 PPG, 5.2 RPG, 7.6 APG

Bob Cousy was the greatest point guard during the early days of the NBA, and he played with the Celtics during his entire 13-year career, excluding a short seven-game stint with the Cincinnati Royals during the 1969-70 season. While Cousy was solid in his first year, averaging 15.6 PPG, 6.9 RPG, and 4.9 APG and making the All-Star team, he was a lot better in his second season as he averaged 21.7 PPG, 6.4 RPG, and 6.7 APG which helped him make the All-NBA 1st Team. Cousy solidified himself as the best point guard of the 1950s during the next eight seasons as he averaged 19.6 PPG, 5.6 RPG, and 8.1 APG which helped Cousy make the All-NBA 1st Team in each of those seasons, the Celtics make the Finals four times in that span, winning three times, and Cousy lead the league in assists per game in all eight of those seasons. During his last three seasons as a Celtic, Cousy dropped off a bit, but he was still an All-Star in those three seasons as he averaged 15.7 PPG, 3.5 RPG, 7.4 APG, and helped the Celtics to an NBA championship in each of those three years. After winning the 1963 NBA Finals, Cousy retired as one of the greatest Celtics of all-time as he leads the franchise in total assists.

&#x200B;

**PG2: Jo Jo White (1969-79)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 2x NBA Champion, 1x Finals MVP, 7x All-Star, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 18.4 PPG, 4.3 RPG, 5.1 APG, 1.3 SPG, 0.2 BPG

While Bob Cousy was a point guard most known for his playmaking abilities, Jo Jo White the playmaker wasn’t very enamoring, but he was a high-scoring point guard for the Celtics in the 1970s. After averaging 12.2 PPG as a rookie, White had the best two seasons of his career during his next two seasons as he averaged 22.2 PPG, 5.3 RPG, and 5 APG while making the All-Star team in both of those seasons. Jo Jo White continued to be an All-Star during each of his next five seasons in the NBA as he averaged 18.9 PPG, 4.3 RPG, and 5.7 APG during those five years. During that span, White also won two championships with the team in 1974 and 1976, winning the Finals MVP in the latter one as he averaged 21.7 PPG, 4.3 RPG, and 5.8 APG in six NBA Finals games against the Phoenix Suns. He spent another year-and-a-half in Boston after that, and he was traded to the Golden State Warriors during the 1978-79 season.

&#x200B;

**PG3: Dennis Johnson (1983-90)**

Accolades w/Team: 4 Finals Appearances, 2x NBA Champion, 1x All-Star, 1x All-Defensive 1st Team, 3x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 12.6 PPG, 3.2 RPG, 6.4 APG, 1.2 SPG, 0.4 BPG

The starting point guard of the dominant Celtics teams during the 1980s, Dennis Johnson was a really good playmaker and defender during his seven-year stint in the NBA’s titletown. When the Celtics acquired him during the 1983 offseason, he changed his role as he was now the fourth option on a loaded team. He averaged just 12.6 PPG as a Celtic during the regular season, but he was a lot better in the postseason in a Celtics uniform as he averaged 16.5 PPG, 3.9 RPG, and 6.8 APG in seven postseason appearances and 109 playoff games with the team. During those seven years, Johnson helped Boston reach the NBA Finals four times while helping them win two championships out of those four Finals runs.

&#x200B;

**SG1: John Havlicek (1962-78)**

Accolades w/Team: 8 Finals Appearances, 8x NBA Champion, 1x Finals MVP, 13x All-Star, 4x All-NBA 1st Team, 7x All-NBA 2nd Team, 5x All-Defensive 1st Team, 3x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 20.8 PPG, 6.3 RPG, 4.8 APG, 1.2 SPG, 0.3 BPG

One of the greatest Boston Celtics players of all-time, John “Hondo” Havlicek spent his entire 16-year playing career with the franchise. During the first four seasons of his career, Havlicek was a key role player on a championship squad as he averaged 17.8 PPG and 5.7 RPG during that span. However, Havlicek improved over the next three seasons as he averaged 21.2 PPG and 6.7 RPG to help them win two championships in that span as well as All-Star selections for Hondo in each of those three years. An elite scorer and defender, Havlicek averaged 26.1 PPG, 8 RPG, and 7.1 APG in the four years after Bill Russell retired as he made an All-NBA team and All-Defensive team in each of those seasons. While he didn’t win any titles during those four years, Havlicek helped the Celtics win another NBA Championship in 1974 as he won Finals MVP by averaging 26.4 PPG, 7.7 RPG, and 4.7 APG in seven games against the Milwaukee Bucks. Although it was clear Havlicek’s stats were worse in his last four years, he still averaged 17.5 PPG, made the All-Star team, and helped the Celtics win another NBA title in 1976. Havlicek retired in 1978 from playing, but he is still the all-time leading scorer for the Celtics forty years later.

&#x200B;

**SG2: Sam Jones (1957-69)**

Accolades w/Team: 11 Finals Appearances, 10x NBA Champion, 5x All-Star, 3x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 17.7 PPG, 4.9 RPG, 2.5 APG

Sam Jones was a clutch performer and scorer on many of the Celtics’ championship squads of the 1960s as he spent his entire 12-year playing career in Beantown. After averaging 4.6 PPG as a rookie, Jones was a solid role player during the next three seasons as he averaged 12.6 PPG and 5.5 APG during that span. Jones’s role increased on the Celtics over the next three seasons as he averaged 19.2 PPG, 5.2 RPG, and 2.9 APG during a span in which he made the All-Star team twice and helped the Celtics win the championship three more times in addition to the three he won in his first four seasons. During the next four seasons, Jones had an even bigger role as he emerged as one of the better scorers in the NBA as he averaged 23.3 PPG, 5 RPG, and 3 APG while making the All-Star team three times and helping the Celtics win another three championships. Averaging 16.3 PPG and helping the Celtics to another championship in 1969, Jones rode off into the sunset, with fellow Celtics great Bill Russell, as one of only two players to win at least 10 NBA Championships.

&#x200B;

**SG3: Bill Sharman (1951-61)**

Accolades w/Team: 5 Finals Appearances, 4x NBA Champion, 8x All-Star, 1955 All-Star Game MVP, 4x All-NBA 1st Team, 3x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 18.1 PPG, 3.9 RPG, 3 APG

One of the best sharpshooters of the early days of the NBA, Bill Sharman played for the Boston Celtics for ten years. After averaging 10.7 PPG in his first season in Beantown, Sharman was a really good scorer for the next four seasons, averaging 17.6 PPG which helped make the All-Star team in each of those four seasons, and he even led the NBA in free-throw percentage in all four of those years. However, Sharman’s best seasons with the Celtics happened over the next four seasons, three of which resulted in championships, as he averaged 20.7 PPG which helped him make the All-Star team in all of those four seasons. After Sharman averaged 16 PPG in his final season and helped the Celtics win another championship, he retired from playing and went into coaching, although not for the Celtics.

&#x200B;

**SF1: Larry Bird (1979-92)**

Accolades w/Team: 5 Finals Appearances, 3x NBA Champion, 2x Finals MVP, 3x NBA MVP, 12x All-Star, 1982 All-Star Game MVP, 1979-80 Rookie of the Year, 9x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 3x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 24.3 PPG, 10 RPG, 6.3 APG, 1.7 SPG, 0.8 BPG

While Larry Bird was drafted by the Celtics sixth overall in the 1978 NBA Draft, he would not play for the team until 1979 where he’d play for his entire 13-year playing career in the NBA. Larry Legend had a really good rookie season as he averaged 21.3 PPG, 10.4 RPG, and 4.5 APG en route to an All-Star selection and the Rookie of the Year award. Bird continued to make the All-Star team in each of his next four seasons as he averaged 23 PPG, 10.7 PPG, and 5.9 APG during that span in which he helped the team win two championships. Bird won Finals MVP in the 1984 NBA Finals as he averaged 27.4 PPG, 14 RPG, and 3.6 APG in seven games against the Lakers. In the next four seasons, Bird played even better as he averaged 28.1 PPG, 9.7 RPG, and 6.8 APG, won an MVP in 1986 and even helped the Celtics win an NBA championship that year as he averaged 24 PPG, 9.7 RPG, and 9.5 APG in six games against the Rockets. However, Bird only played in six games during the 1988-89 season due to injury, and he was never the same after that due to back problems. Bird still averaged 21.6 PPG, 9.2 RPG, and 7.2 APG in his final three seasons, but with his back problems, it was clear he was not the same player he once was. Bird retired in 1992, but he was simply a legend as he is arguably a Top 5 player in NBA history and was an exceptional all-around small forward.

&#x200B;

**SF2: Paul Pierce (1998-13)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 1x NBA Champion, 1x Finals MVP, 10x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 3x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 21.8 PPG, 6 RPG, 3.9 APG, 1.4 SPG, 0.6 BPG

Spending 15 very productive seasons with the Boston Celtics, it’s simply “The Truth” that Paul Pierce is one of the greatest Boston Celtics of all-time. Pierce averaged 18.3 PPG and 5.8 RPG during his first two seasons, but he broke out in his third season while averaging 25.3 PPG and 6.4 RPG in all 82 games despite being stabbed 11 times around a month before the start of that season. Pierce was a really good scorer during the next six seasons as he averaged 24.7 PPG, 6.7 RPG, and 4.3 APG during that span in which he made the All-Star team five times. After the 2006-07 season where they missed the playoffs, the Celtics decided to trade for fellow All-Stars Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett to help Pierce. His stats decreased in the 2007-08 season, averaging 19.6 PPG, but he was still an All-Star and helped the Celtics win their 17th NBA Championship as a franchise that year as Pierce averaged 21.8 PPG, 4.5 RPG, and 6.3 APG while winning the Finals MVP. Pierce continued to be an All-Star in the next four seasons as he averaged 19.3 PPG on an Eastern Conference contender during that span. While he averaged 18.6 PPG in the 2012-13 season, he and the team were aging, and he was traded with KG to the Nets during the 2013 offseason in one of the worst trades in NBA history.

&#x200B;

**PF1: Kevin McHale (1980-93)**

Accolades w/Team:5 Finals Appearances, 3x NBA Champion, 7x All-Star, 2x Sixth Man of the Year, 1x All-NBA 1st Team, 3x All-Defensive 1st Team, 3x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 17.9 PPG, 7.3 RPG, 1.7 APG, 0.4 SPG, 1.7 BPG

Another Celtic lifer, Kevin McHale had a very productive 13-year tenure with the franchise. McHale came off the bench for the majority of the time in his first five seasons as he averaged 15.2 PPG and 6.9 RPG during that span while also helping the Celtics win two championships. After averaging 19.1 PPG and 8.2 RPG during the last two seasons of that five-year duration, McHale became a regular starter for the 1985-86 season, a role he’d maintain for four seasons. During those four years, McHale was one of the best power forwards and second-options in the NBA as he averaged 23.2 PPG and 8.7 RPG during that span as he made the All-Star team in each of those seasons while also helping the Celtics win a championship in 1986 and leading the NBA in field-goal percentage twice. McHale returned to his bench role after the 1988-89 season, but he still averaged 19.8 PPG and 7.7 RPG during the next two years while making the All-Star team both times. After averaging just 10.7 PPG in his final season with the team, McHale retired as he was now 35 years old at that time.

&#x200B;

**PF2: Kevin Garnett (2007-13)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 1x NBA Champion, 5x All-Star, 2007-08 Defensive Player of the Year, 1x All-NBA 1st Team, 3x All-Defensive 1st Team, 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 15.7 PPG, 8.3 RPG, 2.7 APG, 1.2 SPG, 1 BPG

The Boston Celtics acquired Kevin Garnett during the 2007 offseason to help form a “Big Three” with him, Paul Pierce, and Ray Allen. Garnett sacrificed his accolades for the team’s success and averaged 18.8 PPG and 9.2 RPG while winning the Defensive Player of the Year and helping the Celtics win an NBA championship. Garnett’s stats did decrease even more in the next five seasons after that 2008 championship run as he averaged 15.1 PPG and 8.1 RPG during that span. While KG’s stats decreased and injuries hampered him to a small extent, his defense was still really good as he still made the All-Star team an additional four times. While Garnett made the All-Star team in 2013, he was approaching 37 years old, and he was traded with Pierce in the 2013 offseason to the Brooklyn Nets in one of the NBA’s worst trades of all-time.

&#x200B;

**PF3: Tom Heinsohn (1956-65)**

Accolades w/Team: 9 Finals Appearances, 8x NBA Champion, 6x All-Star, 1956-57 Rookie of the Year, 4x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 18.6 PPG, 8.8 RPG, 2 APG

Drafted with a territorial selection in the 1956 NBA Draft, Tom Heinsohn spent his entire nine-year playing career with the Boston Celtics. Heinsohn was really good in his rookie year as he averaged 16.2 PPG and 9.8 RPG which helped him make the All-Star team, win Rookie of the Year, and the Celtics to win their first NBA championship. Heinsohn was a very good scorer in the post as well as a really good rebounder in the next five seasons as he averaged 20.4 PPG and 10 RPG during that span in which he made the All-Star team twice and helped the Celtics win another four seasons. After the 1961-62 season, his averages slightly dipped in his final three seasons, but he still averaged 16.5 PPG and 6.5 RPG in that span while making the All-Star team and winning the championship in all of those three seasons. Heinsohn retired after the 1964-65 season, but he’s still with the franchise to this day as he helps announce home games for the Celtics right now.

&#x200B;

**C1: Bill Russell (1956-69)**

Accolades w/Team: 12 Finals Appearances, 11x NBA Champion, 5x NBA MVP, 12x All-Star, 1963 All-Star Game MVP, 3x All-NBA 1st Team, 8x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-Defensive 1st Team

Stats: 15.1 PPG, 22.5 RPG, 4.3 APG

Bill Russell wasn’t too much of a scorer, but he was an exceptional rebounder, defender, and probably the greatest winner of all-time. Russell was really good in his rookie season as he averaged 14.7 PPG and 19.6 RPG while leading the Celtics to their first NBA championship. As one of the greatest rebounders of all-time, Russell averaged more than 20 RPG in each of the ten seasons after his rookie year. During the ten years after his rookie year, Russell averaged 15.9 PPG and 23.3 RPG while making the All-Star team all ten of those times, and leading the Celtics to eight championships in those ten years from 1957-67. Bill Russell was so dominant during the postseason as he averaged 16.2 PPG and 24.9 RPG in 165 postseason games that the NBA named the Finals MVP award after him. While Russell never won the Finals MVP award that was established in his final season, Russell probably would have had 10 Finals MVP had the award existed back in his prime. As arguably the greatest center of all-time, Russell was the only player to have more championships than fingers despite playing in a relatively weak era. However, he dominated over probably the greatest scorer of his era in Wilt Chamberlain as he only won the championship twice (one after Russell retired) compared to **11** for Russell.

**C2: Dave Cowens (1970-80)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 2x NBA Champion, 1x NBA MVP, 8x All-Star, 1973 All-Star Game MVP, 1970-71 Rookie of the Year, 3x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-Defensive 1st Team, 2x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Drafted fourth overall by the Boston Celtics in the 1970 NBA Draft, Dave Cowens was the next great center to play for the franchise after Bill Russell’s retirement. Cowens had a dominant rookie season as he averaged 17 PPG and 15 RPG to help him win Rookie of the Year, and an even better sophomore season as he upped those averages to 18.8 PPG and 15.2 RPG en route to an All-Star selection. Cowens was even better in his third season than he was in his sophomore season as he averaged 20.5 PPG and 16.2 RPG to help him win the 1973 NBA MVP award despite only making the All-NBA 2nd Team. Cowens continued to be a force in his next five seasons as he averaged 18.8 PPG and 15 RPG while making the All-Star team in each of those five seasons and helping the Celtics win two championships during the 1970s. However, injuries involving his ankles and feet forced Cowens into retirement at the age of 31 despite making the All-Star team in his final season while averaging 14.2 PPG and 8.1 RPG.

&#x200B;

**C3: Robert Parish (1980-94)**

Accolades w/Team: 5 Finals Appearances, 3x NBA Champion, 9x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 16.5 PPG, 10 RPG, 1.5 APG, 0.8 SPG, 1.5 BPG

After four solid seasons with the Golden State Warriors, Robert Parish was traded to the Boston Celtics where he dominated at center for fourteen seasons with the franchise. Despite being the third option on the contending Celtics teams of the 1980s, he was a really good scorer and rebounder for the team. Parish had 11 years from 1980-91 with the franchise where he was really productive as he averaged 17.5 PPG and 10.4 RPG while making the All-Star team eight times and helping the Celtics win three championships. Parish’s stats weren’t the most impressive, but he was still critical to the Celtics of the 1980s as he formed a trio with fellow All-Star Kevin McHale and superstar Larry Bird. The Chief’s stats declined in his final three years in Beantown, averaging 12.8 PPG and 8.6 RPG, and he signed with the Hornets in the 1994 offseason.

&#x200B;

**C4: Ed Macauley (1950-56)**

Accolades w/Team: 6x All-Star, 1951 All-Star Game MVP, 3x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 18.9 PPG, 8.1 RPG, 3.7 APG

Ed Macauley was never a champion nor an outstanding rebounder during his six seasons with the Celtics, but he was one of the most efficient centers of the early days of the NBA. Macauley was really good in his first five seasons with the team as he averaged 19.3 PPG and 8.5 RPG while shooting 45.3% from the field, which was really high for his period as he led the NBA in field-goal percentage twice during that span. Macauley was still very good in his sixth season with the team, averaging 17.5 PPG and 5.9 RPG and making the All-Star team despite the decline in stats. However, the Celtics never got over the hump with Macauley, and he was shipped to St. Louis after the 1955-56 season in a deal that sent the draft rights of Bill Russell to Boston.

**TL;DR All-Time Celtics Roster**

||Starters|Reserves|
|:-|:-|:-|
|PG|**Bob Cousy**|Jo Jo White, Dennis Johnson|
|SG|**John Havlicek**|Sam Jones, Bill Sharman|
|SF|**Larry Bird**|Paul Pierce|
|PF|**Kevin McHale**|Kevin Garnett, Tom Heinsohn|
|C|**Bill Russell**|Dave Cowens, Robert Parish, Ed Macauley|
||*Head Coach*|*Assistant Coaches*|
|Coaching Staff|Red Auerbach|Tom Heinsohn, K.C. Jones|

**Analysis**

* The identity of this team is 1000% winning. Most, if not all, of these players, were winners as 14 out of the 15 players on this won at least one championship with the Celtics. Not only that but all 15 players on the roster made/will make the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame as players.
* I like the starting lineup all-around. Cousy is an excellent playmaker who can pass to Havlicek, Bird, or McHale for easy buckets. Not only that but Cousy was also an excellent scorer and Bird was an excellent playmaker. Bill Russell wasn't ultra-productive offensively, but he more than made up for that with his exceptional defense and rebounding. There are no weak links when it comes to rebounding and defense in the starting five as all of Cousy, Havlicek, Bird, McHale, and Parish were really good when it came to the boards and defense.
* The bench is one of the best out of all the All-Time teams as well. There are lots of very good scorers in the second unit like White, Jones, Pierce, and Cowens. Although White wasn't that impressive as a playmaker, he was still pretty good at it and he'll pass the ball to teammates when they're open. It's also not going to be that easy scoring on that second unit's frontcourt as Garnett and Cowens were both really good defenders.

1709,714,[Meta] Would this sub consider game threads?,"I'm a lurker and I really enjoy the contributions on this sub. I see great discussion and I've learned so much about the game from the posts here. 

One thing I do enjoy are live game posts/commentary and I was wondering whether you guys could somehow make these work in this sub? I know other more popular subs have game threads but given how much better the content on here is for general posts I'm hoping the game threads would also be of a much higher standard.

I also realise game threads are much harder to moderate, so maybe there could be a slight relaxing of standards just for the game threads. Maybe we could do a trial for one game and see how it goes?

EDIT: Thanks guys, appreciate the discussion! I think after reading all the comments I'd agree that this probably won't work here. I guess part of the reason I like game threads is instantaneous feedback and reactions, which is not what this sub is about. Probably the balance in my head is an r/nba game thread but with ~500k subscribers. 

I'm excited about some of the potential changes the mods have mentioned for next season and I also really like the idea of some of the strategy analysis people have suggested.",nbadiscussion

1712,717,Zach Lowe on Curry's Playoff Resume,"As the hyperbolic nature of the annual ""Is Steph bad in the Playoffs"" conversation after his annual terrible shooting game is dying down, I though that Zach Lowe's brief interlude on his last pod was the most nuanced take I've heard yet on the subject(unsurprisingly).

[Clip here](https://www.listennotes.com/clips/bontemps-andrews-t3zRIbXxDjA/). 

I wish I could find a transcript, but the gist of it was that while Steph is more likely to have poor shooting nights in the playoffs than his superstar peers, he's still a great playoff player overall, and a lot of the value he creates will never show up in the box score(even though his box score numbers are really strong). He also mentioned that he thinks that Steph might be a player whose playoff game is 90% of his regular season game against certain opponents, while someone like Kawhi seems to play at 110% of his regular season level in the playoffs.",nbadiscussion

1714,719,[OC] RINGS ERNEH: A Holiday Guide/Analysis of the 2019-2020 title contenders Part 1,"This is an attempt at analyzing and predicting the likelihood that the league's various contenders win the title. I'm going to sort them into tiers. The order within the separate tiers is random. This week, let's do tier 1...

TIER 1: **One of the Greatest Teams Ever?**

*The Milwaukee Bucks*

**Reasons for Optimism:**

1. They're soooo good.

Let's start with this:

[https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/tiny.fcgi?id=jGgYx](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/tiny.fcgi?id=jGgYx)

Only 3 teams have posted a higher srs at this point in the season:

The 1969 Knicks, The 15-16 warriors, and the 16-17 Warriors. Of the teams in the top ten here, ***8 won the title.*** 1 lost in a close game 7 after their best defender and second best player kicked the arguable GOAT in the balls. That team, before going 3-1 up on cleveland, beat an okc team(that played 65 win basketball when healthy) with their best player coming off an mcl sprain. Before that, they were headed to a 2-2 tie in the second round with draymond running the show. Before that they won 73 games playing at a GOATish 70 win pace when healthy. The other team, led the by the player who draymond kicked in the balls, lost a razor thin conference final to a red hot 59 win magic team. Teams this good, ***usually win.*** And off course, they haven't been very healthy.

2.  They've gotten a lot better

Another way to look at this. The bucks very nearly won the title last year posting a top 20 all time srs during the rs and dominating all but 5 games of the playoffs. They got better. A lot better, Let's break it down:

Giannis has gotten a lot better. For an overall look, his PIPM has exploded from +5.5 to +8.6. His RPM has gone from +5 to +7.5. He scores more on comparable effiency, his assist rate has gone up, has orb and drb rate have gone up. His Dpipm, Drpm, to the point where they see him moving past 2 x dpoy gobert as the most impactful defender in the league. He's unlocked lopez as an interioir threat with improved interioir passing, he's improved as a shooter to the extent he can add marginal value to broken possesions, he makes faster cross court reads in transition, and he's added midrange counters like a step back, 2 and a turn around jumper. He is, by any measure, having one of the greatest regular seasons ever, and  the cast around him's gotten better. I mentioned his improved defensive impact earlier, but it's hard to say whether he's gotten better there, or he's just been given more freedom by the emergence of brook lopez as one of the league's elite rim protectors. Sterling Brown, Devincinzo have all progressed and to ice the cake, they have a ""insert really good midrange scorer"" stopper in wesley matthews. If the Bucks meet the clippers in the finals, expect ""should they have let brogdon go?"" threads to run into ""is wesley matthews their second best player?""(no, it's brook lopez.)

3.  They're the most balanced team in the league.

Balance is good. Really good. Especially for the playoffs. It helps you survive bad matchups and exploit good ones. Bucks are the most balanced team in the league, and because of that, they arguably should be favored against their worst possible matchup(who happen to be in their conference but more on that later). Disagree? Let's look at the competition:

Lakers, Really good inside, meh outside

Clippers, Really good outside, meh inside

Philly, Really good everywhere defensively, not so good offensively anywhere

Mavs, What is defense.

Rockets, What is defense.

Celtics, What are bigs?

Raptors, Is Gasol still good? Siakim plz score.

The bucks are good everywhere. The perimiter, the paint, they can do it all. And if you're worried about them leaving three point shots open, don't be, that's an rs thing(more on that later). Their lineup is tied for the best net rating in the league, they're one of the league's deepest teams, and they are the only team in the nba who could potentially be an atg playoff defense while also being one of the league's best offenses. This is the kinda thing that wins titles.

4. Home Court Helps

They're going to have home court throughout the playoffs. Role players tend to get energized by home crowds, and you can always get a few points here and there from free throw wobbles. It doesn't hurt.

**Reasons for Pessimism:**

1. Putting your eggs in one basket

In 2009, there was this guy. He had, some argue, the greatest season ever. His team, the cavs, were the worst team in the league without him. But with him, they posted the 7th best srs in nba history, won 66 games and were going to smash kobe's lakers in the final. Then came the magic. An elite ecf defense with two bigs who destroyed the cavs inside and which rode hot shooting to a 6 game cf victory. Does this sound familiar?  It shouldn't. The bucks aren't the 09 cavs. The cavs were the worst team in the league without lebron, the bucks are... alright, wthout Giannis. Consequently, the bucks are playing significantly better basketball with giannis. However, there is a big heavy defense that could cause serious problems for giannis offensively. And they're arguably the bucks most likely ecf matchup. The issue for the bucks, isn't so much, what they can do, they can do everything, but ***where*** what they do comes from. They aren't unbeatable, like the 17 warriors, because their offense relies on one guy. Take out Giannis, you've nuetralized the buck's o. Like the pre kd warriors and curry, like the pre 90 bulls and jordan, and the early lebron cavs and lebron, when one player is the heart of everything, attacking that player's weaknesses, or disrupting the link between that player and his teammates renders juggernauts ***mortal***\*\*.\*\* The good news is that, like the pre kd warriors, that mortality is only really evident on the offensive side of the floor. The Bucks CAN lose if their offense goes to shit. They can also still win. Such is the value of two way play.

2. Secondary creation, please

The bucks have improved, not by addressing their weaknesses, but doubling down on their strengths, Their defense has gotten better. Giannis has varied his passing a bit, but it pales in comparison to his improvement as a scorer. This team still runs it's everything through a less than great passer. If you're wondering what could make them invulnerable? Lillard for draft picks would do it. Won't happen, but one can dream...

3. High Volume, Okay Efficiency

Bucks make the second most threes in the league after the rockets. And like the Rockets, their effiency is average. While 3>2 usually keeps their offense running, cold shooting, defenses sagging off bledsoe's 25% catch and shoot, could make for some tense series. The good news is their defense could keep them afloat. The bad news is that bricks make defense harder. Three point offense is variable, and variability isn't good when you're the better team.

&#x200B;

**Worst Matchup:**

Bucks fans, here's some advice: If you're offered the choice of signing brogdon(for free) or forcing philly to swap conferences with one of the LA teams, choose the latter. The lakers can't really do anything about your shooters and the clippers can't really do anything about Giannis but Philly could trouble both. They're specially built for Giannis, by the way. Embid is arguably the best playoff rim protector not named gobert and is potentially the league's best defender come playoff time. Hoford is a top ten playoff defender and one of the league's elite rim protectors. Richardson is an elite perimiter defender and thybuile is possibly the best defensive presence coming off anyone's bench. The 6ers have less than average shooting, but they don't use it nearly as much as the bucks. Their offense isn't as good, but it's less variable, and it opens the door for an upset should Gianni's teammates go cold...

&#x200B;

Lakers, Maybe?

They're not really a good matchup, but if the bucks go cold, AD and Dwight and Lebron as help could cause trouble for giannis. Lebron's also a great passer, and great passing can do wonders vs balanced defenses.

&#x200B;

Raptors?

OG gives them the potential to be better defensively than they were last season(though siakim's defense has lagged with an increased load). They also have plenty of playmaking to get by the tress of Milwaukee. They just lack a hypereffecient scoring threat, and given how close their last run-in was, It'll take a lot for them to survive the drop off from kawhi to siakim. Also, this all hinges on Gasol being Gasol come the playoffs. If Gasol plays like he has during the regular season, this series, and any hopes of a Canadian repeat, becomes an afterthought.

**Best Matchup:**

Rockets. If the bucks and rockets play in the final. Expect destruction. The discount bucks ran their scheme last playoffs and once they figured it out held the rocket's offense to an atrocious orating over the last three games of the series. The reason the defense is effective is because

1. Harden lacks midrange counters.
2. Harden is far more comfortable passing left than he is right.

The bucks have the length to defend the rock's shooters and Capela/Tucker really aren't built to stop giannis, not without sacrificing their perimiter anyway, The addition of westbrook adds a new wrinkle for the rocks, but Wesley matthews is close to perfect for stopping those kinds of players. 

&#x200B;

Clippers. A popular narrative arose from the ecf, Kawhi shut down Giannis, mono, a mono. Here's a more accurate one. The raptors started off giving Giannis space to drive by sagging off. Like the celtics, they got pummeled. In this context, Kawhi just lacks the lateral agility or off ball anticipation to do anything against Giannis so they didn't bother trying. Then in game three, Nurse made a switch. The gameplan went from, let Giannis drive into out wall into, lets leave the paint, send two to three perimeter players on the big G and let's funnel him into Marc Gasol. Kawhi, thanks to having extensive perimiter help, was the perfect perimiter player to funnel him into gasol. As he had help, quickness stopped mattering and he could leverage his strength to make giannis attempt dunks over the raptor's best defender(marc gasol). Kawhi, because of his strength, was the best at this funnelling, but Siakim was nearly as effecient in this role(albeit on lesser volume). The point I'm making is transferring Kawhi does not suddenly make you a good matchup for the bucks. The defense revolved around Gasol, and say what you want about zubac improving(lakers still regretting that trade i think), marc gasol he is not. The clippers do not have the personell to do anything close to what the raptors did against Giannis. And on the other side, Wesley Matthew's is probably the iggy to Kawhi's lebron. The bucks also have the length to contest shooters so really, there's no easy dubs for the clippers here. A great passer could render the bucks defense vulnerbale, but great passers, pg and kawhi are not. Upsets do happen, but you don't shut down transcendent interior scorers by relying on your wings.  If the Bucks run into the clippers in the finals, Buck fans should feel fairly good about their chances.

&#x200B;

Celtics. Everything I said about the clippers applies to the celtics. They're mirror versions of each other really. 

&#x200B;

**Misconceptions:**

Three Point Defense. It is true, ***that in the regular season***, the bucks leave shooters wide open. Last season the bucks were last in the league in switches. As a result, they got burned by the celtics hot shooting in game 1. Then, Bud adjusted. They started closing out on shooters and despite cold-ass shooting, the bucks dominated by forcing bricks from range and destroying the celtics on transition. The bucks can stop you from hitting threes. And when they did it vs the celtics, the series became a formality. A regular season win at the start of this season seems to have made celtics fans forget this. Rest assured, if the bucks meet the Celtics in april, Mike Budinhozer will be happy to reteach the same lesson.

&#x200B;

GIANNI'S JUMPSHOT WILL CHANGE HOW DEFENSES DEFEND HIM. No no it won't. Successful defenses already guard him lik e a three point shooter becasue of the danger of his drives. Unless you're expecting him to become Curry, good defenses(well actually only two defenses(tor+phi) have the personnel to pull this off) will do exactly what they did last season. Blitz him and stop his passing lanes. If you want to seriously change how defenses defend him, he needs to pass better, improve his midrange game or have his teammates shoot better. Preferably all of those happen. If not, expect him to be defended like jordan was, except instead of clogging the paint, they'll clog the driving lanes.",nbadiscussion

This team is going to do one thing and only one thing really well, and that is bombing 3s from deep. They have 2 of probably the top 5 3pt shooters of all time on the same time (Miller and Thompson) and also Redick, Allan Houston. They will easily shoot 50+ 3s a game and it's going to be glorious. 

Miller and Klay were no-brainer starts, but the rest of the starting 5 was a bit trickier. Terrell  Brandon (an underrated point who had a couple of really good seasons) made it over Allan Houston (which as a Knicks fan is really painful) because of his ability to distribute the ball. Miller and Thompson are going to be running off of screens constantly and they need someone who can reliably get them the ball. Turner was the best center available (which no offense to Myles Turner who is a good player, is a real indictment on this team) and his rim protection and ability to make open 3s is pretty valuable. Horry made the cut for the starting 4, which gives this lineup even more spacing. If this team makes a run it's going to be because they just out shoot everyone else. 


A few thoughts when constructing the roster

****
* Fill out the roster wasn't too difficult, mainly because there isn't much to choose from. Andirs Biedrins was probably the toughest omission, which just about says it all. Guys like Will Perdue, Gary Trent, Mickael Pietrus, Jerryd Bayless, Jared Jeffries, Dougy McBuckets and MCW were never really a thought. I really want to include SGA, but one season just isn't enough to justify his place on this team, but I could easily see him making it next year. 

* At first glance bigs look like the Achilles heal of this team, but honestly Turner, Sabonis, Salley, Hill, Horry are fine. There isn't a elite player among them, but they're all solid to good NBA players who can play some ball. Salley is a good defensive big off the bench who can at least be a plus rim protector. Sabonis over Biedrins may be a bit controversial, but Biedrins is such a net negative on offense that including Sabonis was an easy call for me. 

* Houston, Redick, Anderson, and Bonzi Wells are an interesting selection of wings off the bench. Bonzi Wells isn't a good player, but there just aren't any other wings I would have taken over him. Houston, Redick, Anderson are interesting coming off the bench. Houston can roast opposing teams bench units and spacing would still be great. 

* The real problem with this team is the lack of creators. There's a lot of guys who can score, but not a lot of guys who can create for others. This team might really struggle against some of the elite perimeter defenses in this tournament (thinking specifically of the #2 team with Kidd and the Glove). 

****

This team at first glance looks really good. I mean Reggie Miller and Klay Thompson on the same team is an unreal combination of shooting, and that's not even factoring in guys like Allan Houston, Redick, Brandon, Anderson, Horry, Turner who need to be respected from deep. Ultimately though this team might struggle creating shots against opposing defense. Terrell Brandon is a forgotten PG who had a couple of really really good seasons, made a couple of All-Star teams, but he's the only creator on the team. Opposing teams with lock down perimeter D will cause problems. The bigs are good, but unremarkable. Turner and Salley are good rim protectors, but they can get manhandled at times. This team is just going to have to jack up more 3s than anyone thinks is possible to have a chance. 

****

Selection #12 team posted tomorrow, but be warned this team is hot garbage. 

Would love to pick people's brains on how this should play out. I've heard people asking to sim it on 2K, or model it out (probably too busy at work to really do it). I thought it could also just be left up to voting. Let me know what you guys think, thanks!",nbadiscussion
1716,721,All-Star 1v1 Tournament: A Different Approach,"I know there's been a lot of discussion already for how a 1v1 tournament could be included in the All-Star festivities and that people here are pretty tired of talking about it. That said, there's obviously a lot of interest in the idea, and I think most would agree that if the  NBA created the event and made it fair, competitive, and fun for the players, it would become one of the most hyped events of the entire weekend.

The issues people seem to bring up a lot are:

1. How to prevent players from being scrutinized by fans for losing, which would discourage participation
2. How to make it competitive.

I think a pure 1-on-1 tournament format would make issue #1 unavoidable, which is why something similar to the Boston drill would be better.

the pool of players rotate playing 1 on 1 with 5-8 seconds per possession. If the player on offense scores, they get a point and the defender goes off. If they don't score, the defender gets the ball and tries to score on the next player. First to 5 points wins.

This would make fans less likely to draw hard comparisons between players, which seems to be the main problem people have with a 1v1 tourney. You could also have separate competitions for bigs and smalls and maybe add some fun rules, like the defender getting to pick where on the court they start the possession(3 pt line, baseline, top of the key, etc.).


To address the competitiveness, my idea is as follows: 

Replace the dunk contest with the Boston Drill tournament as the marquee Saturday Night event (dunk contest still happens but earlier). Only non-all-stars can enter, and the winning big and small are given an all-star spot. Then there will be less big name players who would get scrutinized the most for losing, and the prize would be good enough to make the event competitive. On top of that, players who feel they got snubbed for the ASG can get a chance to prove they belong there.

I'd love to hear what people think. Would it work? How can it be improved? Would fans watch?

Some further concepts to think about:

* Only players from teams without an all-star can enter
* Players can decide whether they want to compete as a big or a small
* Have a cash buy-in like in previous suggestions
* Fan-vote for tournament entries

Thanks!",nbadiscussion
1717,722,What has been most surprising to you all this season?,"Of course, every NBA season has some surprises that are difficult to foresee in the offseason. It's why when looking at a specific trade, signing, or team combination I typically hold my breath until consistency begins to form; this doesn't exclude individual performances. 

***The first major surprise for me*** was the performance of Luka Doncic. His rookie season was definitely awesome, I had no doubts that he was going to be a great player. However, as we're nearing the All-Star Break, I'm a little unsure of what we're witnessing. So far, he's averaging 28.8 PPG, 8.7 APG, and 9.5 RPG at the age of 20 years old. The Mavs are currently 30-19, good enough for 6th in the west. The Mavs aren't an awful team; however, from watching this team perform, Luka has a wild gravity that propels the time to overachievement. Since I've been watching Luka this season, I'm becoming more and more bewildered about the potential of this young player. 

***Next on my list*** is a rather negative one: Mike Conley. So far, he's averaging 12.9 PPG, 4.1 APG, and 3.0 RPG. For only the second time in his career since 2008 (his rookie year), he's not averaging a steal. His minutes have been reduced as he is no longer starting. With that being said, his shooting splits have not been great. On the season, he's shooting 38.2% from the field and 34.8% from the three. Now, there is still a chance that he picks up his play and finds a fitting role. However, for his massive 32M contract, it's not looking fruitful thus far. Despite this downfall, the Utah Jazz are, surprisingly, 4th in the west with a 32-17 record. They're still doing fine, which is nice to see. 

***I also have to discuss my favorite team, the Sixers.*** So far, I'm conflicted on whether or not to be excited about this team Elton Brand has built. On paper, it still looks like the best team in the league, in my opinion. Over the summer, many fans, including myself, bought into the hype as most major power-ranking websites had Philly as a top-5 team in the league. However, this has been far from the case. When the Sixers are able to score baskets, they're very challenging to beat. But that's the key point: scoring baskets is sometimes difficult. I've watched almost every game this season and countless times I've seen the offense come to a screeching halt. No intelligent ball movement, seemingly no effort, unresolved turnover issues, and just not hitting shots. A lot of Sixers fans still believe that the team still has a major shot at the title. I'm just not sure this is the case if the team continues to be incredibly streaky. It's also difficult to find something or someone to point the finger at as it's just a weird fit all around. They're a playoff team, but the hype was too high. 

***Some other things to note,*** I love the Grizzlies' success thus far. They're still a young team undoubtedly. However, they've set themselves up for success in the future. I mean hell, they're even getting mass-media attention, something that has evaded the small-market Memphis team for a while. With Ja, JJJ, Clarke, Brooks, and JV, they're actually a really fun team to watch. As of recent, watching Lillard have a historical run has been shocking. He's always been excellent, but in the back of my mind I wonder if he's budding into something that no one has predicted: a future MVP candidate (if the Blazers figure it out). 

With all of this being said, what has surprised yall so far this season? Any disagreements with what I've said thus far?",nbadiscussion
1718,723,[OC] Most Efficient Teams by Shot Location,"tl;dr: [Chart](https://imgur.com/xvblgOt)

We may be in the golden era of the three-point shot, but the two best teams in the league are the two teams who are most efficient with their shots at the rim. 

Using data from the NBA, I mapped every shot taken by each team this season and binned them into hexagons, ala Kirk Goldsberry. I then calculated every team's points per shot for those attempts in each hexagon to find out who has been most efficient from each location. 

**[This chart](https://imgur.com/xvblgOt) shows the result.**

Each hexagon represents the team with the highest points per shot from that location. 

For example, the Bucks generate about 1.3 points per shot on either side of the rim, which is tops in the league. Meanwhile, Portland (thanks to CJ and Melo) and San Antonio (thanks to DeMar and LaMarcus) are well represented in the mid-range. 

My favorite things that you can see on the map:

* The Sabonis pick and pop at the elbow 

* Kevin Love’s baseline game 

* Melo still thinking its 2007

* CP3’s jumper at the foul line 

* Brandon Clarke's floater

* Luka setting THJ up for a corner three

* George Hill making every single off-center three point shot 

* Dwight, Javale, and AD finishing at the rim

You'll notice that there are several blank spaces just inside the three point line. That's analytics Erne -- no team has taken 30 attempts from those locations. 

**Note that the points per shot calculation does not include shot attempts that led to free throws. So if you're team is really good at generating fouls from a certain location, then they may be underrepresented on this chart**

1719,724,Why do NBA players not negotiate equity ownership in the teams they help build vs. cash?,"Random (potentially dumb) question that has come to mind at various points - Would love to hear what this group’s thoughts are since I only casually follow the NBA (or understand how the organization and/or teams are managed).

QUESTION: Is there any reasons why top franchise players are not able to negotiate equity vs. cash (or some mix)?

Many companies compensate senior executives with equity (to align interest, reward the folks that are contributing to the growth of the business, etc.), however I never really heard of this being done with players.

The one example that comes to mind often is Steph Curry’s contribution to the Warriors’ franchise. I recall reading when Joe Lacob and Peter Guber bought the Warriors for ~$450mm around the time that Steph joined the team. Although today Steph is well compensated in relation to other high performing players, I can’t help but think about his contribution to the franchise’s current valuation which is well over $3bn today. As a franchise player, why wouldn’t you want equity compensation over the years in lieu of a ~$200mm contract?

Thanks for any insight or thoughts you can share.",nbadiscussion
1720,725,Why does Westbrook continue to jack up low percentage jumpers?,"Russell Westbrook is not a good shooter.   


I am rooting for the blazers in this series and when I saw that Westbrook was torching the Blazers in game 3 from long-range, I was not concerned one bit. That was just an out of the blue performance that could not be consistently replicated throughout the series. By continuing to jack up long range shots, Westbrook is playing in to the hands of the blazers, even when he makes his shots.   


He's just not a good enough shooter for his jump shots to be considered reliable offense. Isolating Paul George on the right-wing would be infinitely better offense than Westbrook coming off a P&R and firing one up.   


Why on earth does he continue to take these shots???",nbadiscussion

1722,727,Using stats to tell us what we already knew about Giannis and the Bucks this season.,"**Disclaimer: I have little to no academic or professional background in statistics or machine learning, just picked it up this past month and thought I'd do this project as a learning experience.  If this post sucks (high likelihood), it's because I do in fact, suck at this.**

It's about halfway into the season so I thought this might be a good time to crunch some numbers.  The purpose of this exercise was to determine which statistical factors on Giannis's game logs were most conducive to Wins.  I'd also like to point out that the data pool is a little small, especially the losses (which have been rare for the Bucks this year) so expect some error.

I used Basketball Reference and NBA.com to create 2 separate pools of data to run some statistical models on.  I ran a Random Forest Classifier to see which statistical elements the computer thought were most important to predicting Wins, and created some scatterplots and a couple of Linear Regression Plots of some of the more interesting stats.

From Basketball Reference, here are the statistical categories used in the Random Forest: 'FG', 'FGA', 'FG%', '3P', '3PA', '3P%', 'FT', 'FTA', 'FT%', 'ORB', 'DRB', 'TRB', 'AST', 'STL', 'BLK', 'TOV', 'PF', 'PTS'

[Here is the Pie Chart for how heavily the computer weighed each category when predicting Wins](https://i.imgur.com/4xHdEuD.png)

3PT% came out at a whopping 37.5%.  After some calculations, it turns out that when the Bucks win Giannis shoots 35.58% from three, and a measley 8.3% during losses.  I don't think this really comes at a surprise that he shoots 35% during wins, he and the Bucks are essentially unstoppable when he's hitting from downtown.  The 8.3% on losses however was mildly interesting.

[Here's a graph showing the relationship between 3PT% and the Win/Loss Margin](https://i.imgur.com/8vT9eqG.png).  Orange dots are wins, and blue dots are losses.

[Here's the relationship between Plus/Minus and Minutes Played](https://i.imgur.com/Dk4QLWQ.png).  No surprise here, when Giannis has a high Plus Minus he tends to get less minutes.  It might also show that when Giannis sits, the Bucks are putting in work to help him stay out of games.

[Here's another unsurprising graph of the relationship between Points and Plus Minus.](https://i.imgur.com/HfB5Jet.png)  That loss near the bottom right was a 48 point effort against Dallas.

I wanted to see if there was a [relationship between Assists, Plus Minus and Wins](https://i.imgur.com/FXe1pCq.png), and there didn't seem to be much correlation here.

Lastly from BBall Reference, here's the relationship between [3PT Attempts and 3P%](https://i.imgur.com/44snBdk.png).  I made the dots transparent to show redundant points.  Dots that are looking gray/black are where both losses and wins coincide.  This data was all over the place, not much here I think.

Now, moving on to NBA.com for some more advanced stats.  I wanted to do something with their hustle stats, but I couldn't find a way to see them game to game, so I went with their advanced scoring metrics.  The statistical categories used here were: '%FGA 2PT', '%FGA 3PT', '%PTS 2PT', '%PTS 2PT MR', '%PTS 3PT','%PTS FBPS', '%PTS FT', '%PTS OFFTO', '%PTS PITP', '2FGM %AST','2FGM %UAST', '3FGM %AST', '3FGM %UAST', 'FGM %AST', 'FGM %UAST'.

Here is the [Pie Graph showing what stats the computer thought were most important when predicting Wins](https://i.imgur.com/VVp29i4.png).  

It's a bit more evenly distributed here, but looks like the winner here is Percentage of Points as 2PTers coming in at 23.4%.  Another 2 pointer related stat comes in second, 2PT FG made that were unassisted (15.6%).  Points in the paint coming in third (10.6%) and interestingly Percentage of Points as 3PTers came in fourth (8.9%).

So, the data from BBall Reference showed that 3PTers were most predictive of wins, but the advanced scoring metrics from NBA.com seemed to disagree.  So I plotted some graphs.

First, here's the [relationship between Minutes Played and % of PTS as 2Pters](https://i.imgur.com/hELpbaQ.png).  Notice those losses at the top right?  The correlation of losses crosses with these 2 categories isn't the strongest, but there is a distinct absence of losses the closer to the lower left you get. 

So, out of curiosity, I plotted [the same plot, but with % of PTS as 3PTers](https://i.imgur.com/zi4bgzz.png).  From this it looks like the more minutes Giannis plays, the higher the percentage of his shots that will be 2PTers.  It's not surprising that the losses are clustered the higher the minutes go because those are the closer games, but it certainly looks like the data from BBall reference is getting a little validation here.

Just for shits I thought I'd check [the linear regression of Minutes and %of 3PTers](https://i.imgur.com/SmfD5q8.png) and it does show a slightly downward slope, although from the shaded blue area there does seem to be some error.  

So I decided to plot that same graph, [but separating the data from Wins and Losses](https://i.imgur.com/gCmXCAI.png).  As you can see from the shaded orange area, the error is reduced for Wins because there was simply more data points to train the computer with.  

Here is that same [graph separated by Wins, but with % of PTs as 2PTers](https://i.imgur.com/zMebhnW.png).  As you can see, it is the inverse relationship from the %of3PTers data.  

**TLDR: When Giannis makes 3s, the Bucks win.  He also plays less minutes.**",nbadiscussion

Lillard drops multiple games with 50+ and Harden is averaging \*34 Points Per Game\* and even Bradley Beal averaged more than 30ppg. Game scores all seem quite high.

&#x200B;

I guess I'm wondering, does anyone else feel unimpressed when they see new scoring records? What are the reasons for this explosion in scoring? It's hard for me to get too excited about great individual scoring efforts when I think about how a guy like Donovan Mitchell scored more in a playoff game than all of the greatest scorers in NBA history, save for 2.",nbadiscussion
1725,730,"Going into next season, what do you think your team’s ceiling is?","Personally, as a Mavs fan, I think a lower playoff seed and second round (or first, depending on matchups) is the best we’ll do next year if everyone stays healthy, but I realize I’m probably expecting too much. Luka seemed like a future all star this year, and we already know what KP can do when he’s healthy. 



What does everyone else think about their team?",nbadiscussion
1726,731,I learned 2 things from the game last night (OKC v. UTAH),"1.) The Thunder are somehow underrated again. They proved last night that this team has far different DNA than last year's squad. They are executing in the clutch cohesively, and with a huge amount of confidence. If Russ can keep shooting at a decent clip and PG maintains this new level. Look. Out. This roster is not only brimming with talent and athleticism, but they play a ferocious brand of defense. This team has finally been able to actualize it's potential, and it's fun to watch. Their ceiling is staggering.

2.) The Jazz are DANGEROUS. I can guarantee there were teams watching the game last night thinking ""Damn...I really don't want to see them in the playoffs...""
The Thunder have good bigs, and the Jazz straight up wrecked them the entire night. Rebounds, put-backs, etc... Defensively, Gobert is a monster and a legit DPOY candidate. Ingles literally doesn't miss if he has an inch of airspace. Rubio is still a great floor general. And we haven't even talked about Donovan Mitchell. This dude is an A1 superstar. He put on a show last night and reminded everyone why he was so hyped up last year. Dude is a leader and not afraid of the big moment, he doesn't flinch in the crunch time. If this team can draft well or attract another star, they will contend for the West. Even now, I wouldn't be suprised if they made a run.",nbadiscussion
1727,732,Jalyen Brown and Boston Celtics contract extension,"As it was reported there are slim chances that they will reach an agreement until October 21. Pretty much biggest issue here is determining his value. On one side for some other team he might be worth giving max contract but maybe for Celtics who payed Kemba this summer, still have two years of Hayward's contract and will have to pay Tatum next year that's too much and doing so will give them no flexibility to improve in the future. 

Jaylen as a player broke out in 17/18 season after Hayward went down but as entire Celtic squad last year he couldn't replicate that form and chemistry issues were showing as I guess they couldn't get the roles on the court settled as bunch of players had similar number of shot attempts per game last season. Even though now with Kemba replacing Kyrie and Morris and Horford gone ball distribution will be more clear still I think that Kemba and Tatum will be first and second options for Celtics. 

Personally I can imagine some team nex summer giving him a max contract (especially teams like the Raptors having all the space in the world to sign players and to be honest I can imagine him and Siakam being a good duo) so the Celtics will have a tough decision. For them maybe it makes no sense to give him max money but it sure doesn't make sense to lose him for nothing. Last year with Smart they played the waiting game and managed to tie him down on a decent contract for both sides but I think that demand for Brown will be much bigger. Maybe it's time for them to consider trade talk with interested teams who will pay him that money nex summer and Celtics can get some pieces to put around their current roster (much needed help in the frontcourt now) 

What would you do in their situation and what do you think will happen?",nbadiscussion
1728,733,Who should the Lakers be targeting in free agency?,"Assuming that Kawhi or Kyrie aren't about to take big pay cuts to play in LA, the Lakers are going to need to fill in their roster without any more of this summer's darling, max contract free agents. The Lakers also only have about 5 players on their team right now, so perhaps that would have been their plan regardless. 

I think **JJ Redick** would be an obvious choice if he wanted to leave Philly, who is about to be paying a lot of money for next year's roster. However, he already has a defined role in Philadelphia and they have championship aspirations next season, perhaps even more than the Lakers. He made 12.5 million last year and will have no shortage of offers given his skill set. Another option is **Patrick Beverly**, a great defender that can compete with the amazing point guards of the West and shoots 3s decently. These are both the kind of guards you want to put around LeBron. 

Anthony Davis prefers to play the 4, and has said as much, opening a need for a true center. I'd be calling either Brook or Robin Lopez, but, Brook has already had a less than stellar stint in purple and gold. DeAndre Jordan or DeMarcus Cousins are both available but I feel they will be looking to be paid more elsewhere. **Nerlens Noel** is a Klutch Sports client and has a player option for this year, and if he wound up the starting 5 in LA I wouldn't be even a bit surprised. 

Similar to Noel, Markieff Morris is a Klutch client and is a UFA. I don't think he fills any need for this team but he could be roster backfill. The team retaining Kentavious Caldwell-Pope or Rajon Rondo is also not out of the question, but, these are at best bench players right now and I would not be excited to see them come back next season. Rondo at least is a good bench playmaker. 

Anyways, if you were the Lakers GM, how would you spend ~24 million dollars of Buss money?",nbadiscussion

1730,735,Who is a better overall player: Hakeem or Shaq?,"In my opinion, Hakeem Olajuwon is clearly a better overall player than Shaquille O' Neal and I would much rather have him on my team.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Let's begin with **defense**, and split it into 3 sections - rim protection, perimeter defense/versatility, and accolades.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1. **Rim Protection**. I believe Hakeem is a better rim protector than Shaq, and it's not even close.  Firstly, Hakeem has over a **thousand** more blocks than Shaq, and he has the most blocks of all time (Shaq is at eighth). Not only that, but he has the highest career blocks average of all time, at 3.1 blocks per game for his career. Shaq is at 2.3 blocks per game for his career. Hakeem is known for locking down NBA superstars such as Patrick Ewing (if you want clips, go to 1994 Finals Game 7), Karl Malone (go to 1994 Western Conference Finals), and ***Shaq himself***(look at 1995 Finals).
2. **Perimeter defense & versatility.** Hakeem comfortably beats Shaq in both; Hakeem averages **nearly two steals** for his career, which is astounding for a center. Shaq is at 0.6 steals per game for his career. Additionally, Hakeem is 9th all time in steals, which is crazy as a center.  Hakeem has over **1,400** more steals than Shaq. Disregarding statistics for a moment, Hakeem had incredible mobility, quick feet, and active hands. Shaq, although an incredible rim protector, was very limited defensively as his versatility was near zero.
3. **Accolades.** Hakeem has 2 more DPOYS, he has 6 more All-Defensive team selections, and lead the league in blocks 3 times(compared to Shaq's zero).
4. **Overall**, Hakeem is **clearly** a better defender than Shaq.

&#x200B;

Now, let's compare their **rebounding.** Let's split this into 3 sections again; offensive rebounding, defensive rebounding, and accolades.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1. **Defensive Rebounding**. Hakeem is comfortably a better defensive rebounder than Shaq; after all, he is a much better defender. For their careers, Hakeem averages about half a defensive rebound more than Shaq. The difference is exposed when you examine their totals; Hakeem has nearly **1,000** more defensive rebounds than Shaq for their careers. Note: Shaq played one more season.
2. **Offensive Rebounding**. Shaq takes an edge in offensive rebounding here; after all, he was a monster on putbacks. He averages 0.2 more offensive rebounds per game for their careers. In terms of totals, the difference is less than 200.
3. **Accolades.** Hakeem lead the league in total rebounds twice, while Shaq did it no times. Hakeem is 13th on all time total rebounds list, Shaq is 15th. Hakeem has over 600 more rebounds total for their careers. 
4. **Overall**, Hakeem is clearly a better rebounder than Shaq.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now, let's look at their **shooting**. This hardly needs elaboration; Shaq is one of the worst shooters of all time. Regardless, let's analyze it in terms of mid range shooting and free throws.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1. **Mid Range Shooting**. Hakeem is a comfortably better mid-range shooter than Shaq. His deft touch in the post and array of fadeaways hardly need statistics. Let's look at the 1996-97 season, in which they are probably the closest. Shaq is halfway into his prime, while Hakeem is slightly receding. Hakeem made 200 more mid range shots and was also 7% more efficient. I, personally, was surprised; Shaq is actually a better mid range shooter than I thought. However, Hakeem is significantly more efficient and makes far more mid range shots. Therefore, Hakeem is unarguably a better mid range shooter than Shaq.
2. **Free Throw Shooting**. Hakeem is by far a better free throw shooter than Shaq. For their careers, Hakeem is nearly **20%** more efficient at the line. For their best and worst seasons, the difference is consistently around 20%, in Hakeem's favor.
3. **Overall**, Hakeem is clearly a better shooter. He is also a better 3 point shooter, although this point is moot as neither shot the 3 often. Hakeem has made 24 more 3s in his career, though. 

&#x200B;

So far, we have established that Hakeem is a better shooter, rebounder, and defender. Shooting and defense by a large margin, while rebounding is close. Now, let's move onto post scoring, which we will split into 2 sections: dominance/efficiency, and post moves.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1. **Dominance/Efficiency**. In the 1996-97, the closest comparable season as Hakeem was slightly declining and Shaq was right about to hit his peak seasons, Shaq was 10% more efficient in the restricted area. In Shaq's absolute peak, he averaged 77% in the restricted area. I can concede that Shaq was significantly more efficient and dominant at the rim.
2. **Post Moves**. I think although Shaq had a nice assortment of moves, Hakeem clearly bests him in this category. Hakeem had perhaps the best post game ever, with an unreal array of fades, spins, and hooks. Comparing Shaq's peak season in 2000-01 and Hakeem's 96-97 season, Hakeem was 13% more efficient in the paint outside the restricted area, which boosts my post moves point. 
3. **Overall**, I can admit that despite Hakeem's more expansive and honed post moves, Shaq is the better post scorer.

&#x200B;

So far, we have established that Hakeem is a better shooter, rebounder, and defender. Shaq is a better post scorer. Now, let's move on to playoff success, split into stats and competition/help.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1. **Playoff Stats**. Hakeem averages 25.9 ppg for his career playoffs, while Shaq averages 24.3 ppg. However, Shaq has **nearly 1,500** more points total for his career playoffs than Hakeem. For rebounds, Shaq edges out Hakeem in rebounds per game, and has nearly 1,000 more rebounds in playoff totals. 
2. **Playoff Competition**. However, you'd be hard pressed to find MVP centers that Shaq played against during his 3 peat. Yes, Dikembe Mutombo in the 2001 finals (he was 34), but who else? Hakeem went back to back with a fringe (at best) all-star. He faced MVP centers in each round of the playoffs. In the 1993-94 playoffs, he went against MVP-caliber Charles Barkley in the Western Conference Semis, MVP-caliber Karl Malone in the WCF, and MVP-caliber Patrick Ewing in the NBA Finals. Regardless, he averaged a cool **29, 11, and 4 blocks per game**. In the 1994-95 playoffs, he faced ***two*** 60 win teams, and an MVP-caliber center in **each round**. In the first round, he faced 60 win Jazz with MVP-caliber Karl Malone. In the second, he faced 59 win Suns with MVP-caliber Charles Barkley. In the third round, he faced the 60 win Spurs and reigning MVP David Robinson. In the Finals, he manhandled **Shaq himself** to win back to back titles.  Despite the even more difficult competition, Hakeem averaged **33, 10, and 3 blocks per game**. 
3. **Help**. Shaq had the second best shooting guard of all time in Kobe Bryant for his 3 peat; even though he was the leader, Kobe was integral to that 3 peat. In 2006, he had the third best shooting guard ever in Dwyane Wade, who led the team to a chip. In both of his champinships, Hakeem had no other All Stars on his team. To be fair, in 1994-95, he had an All Star caliber player in Clyde Drexler, although he wasn't selected. 
4. **Overall**, I believe when you account for competition and help, Hakeem was better in the playoffs than Shaq. He manhandled MVP centers and obliterated 60 win teams to win back to back NBA championships.

&#x200B;

Now, let's look at intangibles and accolades.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1. **Accolades**. Hakeem and Shaq each have one MVP. Hakeem has 2 more DPOYS. Shaq had 3 more All-Star selections (this is effectively pointless). Shaq had 1 more Finals MVP. Shaq had 2 more All-NBA selections. Shaq had 2 more scoring titles. He won Rookie of the Year (to be fair, Hakeem had MJ in his draft class). Shaq also had 2 more championships (although this doesn't matter as much as you may think, if you've read my above post. Hakeem had more defensive team selections, more rebounding titles, and more blocks titles.
2. **Intangibles**. Shaq is notorious for his laziness and relied on Kobe to spend time in the gym for him. Hakeem improved Kobe's game through teaching him the art of the post game. Hakeem is known for teaching other players on how to play in the post. Hakeem is a better leader; he carries inferior teams to championships, while Shaq, although dominant, was not much of a leader despite being far and away the best player on the team during the 3-peat. 

&#x200B;

To conclude, we can see that Hakeem was a better shooter, defender, rebounder, playoff performer, leader, and teacher. Shaq is more dominant, and a better post scorer. **Hakeem is a better overall player than Shaq, and it's not even close**. Not only this, but Shaq has sang Hakeem’s praises countless times. I would also much rather have Hakeem than Shaq. Thank you for reading, and let me know what you think.",nbadiscussion
1731,736,How would you defend/beat the bucks?,"So this will be kind of a low effort post since the point of it actually is to ask the question, which is what the title says: from a tactical standpoint, what would you do to beat the milwaukee bucks, if you are the lakers or the clippers?   
Obviously I would try to play giannis off and be as phisical as possible trying to throw off his center of gravity like kawhi did and hope the refs don't blow the whistle, and just in general defend them in some way that tries to bet on the shooting percentages of guys like brook lopez who is having a terrible shooting season, his brother, bledsoe, pat who can't really shoot, divincenzo etc.   


Also their defense, especially on the inside seems really unstoppable, and the lakers offense is centered around the guy who is maybe the best ever at getting to the rim, lebron james, who now is 35 and has taken a step back in that regard if you check the stats, and AD, who is a monster but isn't really reliable with his midrange as people seem to think he is. Really the only way to dismantle their defense seems to me kawhi going nuclear from the midrange like in last year playoffs, shooting 55-60% in the series for like 5 baskets a game and like 3 3s a game with 40+, I don't really see a team who wants to go inside beating them.  


Maybe you can try to blitz me but again, I can't make up a clear, like, step by step image of something that would work against them if you are not the peak golden state warriors.

So, from a tactical standpoint, what would you do?",nbadiscussion

1734,739,How would you rank the top 5 point guards in NBA history?,"I think number one is still clearly Magic. His longevity is lacking, however his 5 titles, 3 mvps, and 10 all-nba appearances is super impressive. From 2-5 I think it becomes very difficult to rank who goes where. Here are the strongest candidates for these spots:

\- Oscar Robertson

\- Old Isiah Thomas

\- Gary Payton

\- John Stockton

\- Jason Kidd

\- Steve Nash

\- Chris Paul

\- Steph Curry

I think creating this ranking is very tough for a number of reasons. First, you have guys like Nash, Paul, and Stockton who were all incredible players that could elevate their team but were unable to win titles due to facing some great teams (Spurs, Lakers, Bulls).

Second, you have players who benefited from the environment they were in. For example, you have a player like Oscar who put up incredible numbers but played against weaker competition, and had little team success before Kareem came. Another example is the system that Nash was apart of on the Suns. Don't get me wrong Nash was incredible and deserved his MVPs but what if a prime Chris Paul ended up in that same situation, would he also have won those MVPs?

Third, ranking Steph is tough because he still has many years left in his career before he retires. The start of his career is less impressive than probably anyone else on this list except Nash, but from 2014 onwards he's won 3 titles and 2 MVPs. His 2015-16 season is probably one of the 5 greatest individual seasons of all time.

Here's my top 5, would love to hear yours:

1. Magic
2. Steph (assuming he'll be a top 10 nba player for a few more years even without winning more titles)
3. Stockton
4. Thomas
5. CP3 (Debating between him and Nash was super difficult but ultimately went with CP3 because of his defense)",nbadiscussion
1735,740,Which do you think is more important for a championship?,"I haven’t seen this post on here before, so i thought I’d ask, which do you think is more important for a championship, being a 1 seed and facing an incredibly easy team and an easier team before facing real competition, or being a 2/3 seed and potentially facing pretty good competition in every round?
I personally being a 2 seed is pretty ideal, because you face a pretty easy team in the first round, and then face some real competition in the 2nd round to unite your team more and put the players into competitive mode. This has been proven by teams like the Raptors last year, who went through a slog of a Sixers second round series before beating Milwaukee in 6 and effectively sweeping them. It’s also been proven by the 95 Rockets, the 04 Pistons, and the 11 Mavericks. But teams like the 17 Warriors and 01 Lakers have just dominated their way to the top

1736,741,"How much does the president of an NBA really have to do on a team's success? Also, when does blame shift within an organization for the team's failure?","Watching Inside the NBA on TNT with Shaq, Chuck, Kenny, and Ernie is always entertaining to me, and sometimes they seem to have pretty good insight about the NBA as to why something happened a certain way, or two of them will end up having a debate about something.  Just the other day, after the Celtics beat the Hornets 108-87 in Kemba's return to Charlotte, Kenny Smith said something along the lines of ""if the loss is >7, it's on the players. If it's <7, it's on the coach."" Shaq went on to disagree, saying ""coaching doesn't have anything to do with it"".  **This got me thinking, who do you blame for a team's failure during a game? And who do you blame for long term failure?**

As many of you may have seen, after a win against the Dallas Mavericks this past Friday night, the New York Knicks suffered an embarrassing home loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers 108-87 (same score as Celtics-Hornets, coincidence?), making their record fall to 2-8 in what seems like another lost season with barely a sliver of hope going forward, other than another 14% chance at the number 1 draft spot (So much for this team bringing back the ""Old School 90s Knicks Basketball"" mentality and ""protecting the Garden"", especially since that era of NYK basketball was known for their defense, because defense was nonexistent in this game, where they allowed CLEs second-year Sexton to drop 31 in MSG).  As a result of the loss, fans at MSG starting chanting ""Fire Dolan"" in response to the Knicks owner (and seemingly a tyrant as well) James Dolan, and the fan that started that chant was later escorted out of his seat by security.  Soft move by Dolan in my opinion to have a fan thrown out for ""saying fire the owner"" in a blowout loss to another bad team; everyone should be entitled to free speech, especially a paying fan of a team that's sucked for years. 

After the game, the team's President Steve Mills and GM Scott Perry call an impromptu press conference where they address the media by saying they're ""not happy"" and that the team is ""not performing to the level they expected"".   They went on addressing the media, stating the obvious about the team's play and so on.  (Also as I was writing this I got a notification that said Mills is now ""angling to fire David Fizdale"".)  Through these times for the Knicks, it makes me wonder: **when do you blame the team's failures on the players, when is it the coach, the GM, President, or owner?** 

In the Knicks' case, it seems that all signs point to James Dolan not knowing how to be a good owner of an NBA team.  Since their Finals appearance in 1999, they've missed the playoffs 13 (looking like 14) times in 20 years, and the only times they've made the playoffs they can't get out of the first round (except for 2013 when they lost in the second round).  As a result, Dolan seems to be the main reason as to why they've been such a laughing stock for so long.  Many Knicks fans, though, disagree on who's to blame for the poor start to the season.  Some say Fizdale and his inability to coach the young guys with the vets, others say its Mills poor job at being president of the team.  Which leads to my other question: **Does the president of the team really have that much of an impact on a team's performance?  The front office and head coaching position of the Knicks has changed so much in recent years, how can you point a finger at one person?** 

When I look at other teams, I wonder if they're success is coming from ownership, coaching, front office, or just straight balling out from players, and I wonder how the lesser teams in the NBA could achieve that.  Especially with the Lakers, I'm curious to see how they turn out after several sub-par seasons and missing the playoffs, given the amount of talent they have between Lebron and Davis, as well as the amount of drama that took place over the offseason with them, like Magic stepping down, failing to hire Ty Lue as coach, and so on.  I'm looking forward as to what happens to the Lakers this year, with amazing talent on the court and a not-as-functional front office as one would hope to have.  

In my opinion, I think that a team's dysfunction is really dependent on the owner more than anything else, at least in the Knicks case that is.  When I look at the Clippers owner Steve Ballmer, he seems like a guy that players want to play for, and that is a big reason as to why Kawhi and PG13 came to that LA team.   I also believe Doc Rivers played a big role in recruiting those two stars, but Ballmer seems to have his franchise figured out.  This seems to be opposite of the Knicks case, where players have come out and said they like the front office guys and the head coach, but they did not want to play for Dolan's team (I'd mention the whole KD situation but I don't know the exact details).  

What are your opinions? Do you believe that a team's long term success is something that comes from the owner? The front office? A good head coach? From your favorite team, what has been the case for them?",nbadiscussion

1743,748,[OC] Taking a Look at Advanced Stats that Correlate with the Success of Second-Round Draft Picks,"(Crosspost from r/nba)

&#x200B;

As someone who frequents this sub, I wanted to share some work of mine from this past year that may be of interest to some of you. For my senior thesis this past year, inspired by my interest in basketball stats, I set out to try to predict the success second-round picks based on their stats from college. Why only second-round draft picks, you might ask? Because as most NBA fans can relate to, we almost always expect our teams' first-round draft picks to be good. Dare I say even great. However, we're much less invested in second-round picks, who are often fringe roster guys. However, when a second-round draft pick pans out, it provides a huge edge to a team as these are guys who at least initially are on very cheap contracts. If we're just looking at these past NBA finals alone, key guys like Danny Green, Marc Gasol, and of course Draymond Green were all former second-rounders. To make things even more interesting, instead of using traditional statistics, like points, rebounds, assists, etc, I decided to take a dive into the world of advanced metrics, due to the analytics craze going on in sports, to see if any of these stats were useful predictors for the success of second-round picks.

&#x200B;

Without further ado, on to the study. As the actual thesis is very long and contains some dense statistics (link at the bottom if you're interested or just really bored), I have summarized the key points of the study below:

&#x200B;

**Abstract**

The second-round is often an overlooked portion of the NBA draft, and second-round draft picks are often viewed as peripheral assets in trades. However, finding key contributors in the second-round can go a long way towards building a successful team. This thesis aims to identify key statistics from a player’s college career that may be able to help predict a player’s success in the NBA. To do so, various methods of regression will be used with a variety of advanced college basketball statistics as potential predictor variables to produce models for both longevity and productivity in the NBA. In addition, these models will be applied to previous second-round picks to see how well they predict the performance of well-known NBA second rounders. In producing these models, win shares, and more specifically, defensive win shares, were found to be a significant predictor for multiple responses, providing evidence that defensive win shares in college may be a crucial advanced statistic to key in when searching for value in the second-round of the NBA draft. In addition, the success of forwards also seemed to differ from the success of non-forwards. When applied to past second-round picks, these models predicted favorable outcomes for notable NBA second-round picks, such as Hassan Whiteside and Draymond Green.

&#x200B;

**Goals**

The aim of this thesis was to identify statistics that are correlated with second-rounder success. To do so, a variety of advanced basketball statistics were used to compare a player’s performance in college to their performance in the NBA. In the end, the goal was to uncover a set of variables that are common to second-round draft pick success in the NBA.

&#x200B;

**Methods**

While there are many ways to evaluate a player's success in the NBA, for the purposes of this study, success was measured in two ways: longevity and productivity. In order to measure longevity, the number of seasons a player played in the NBA was used. Productivity was evaluated using total win shares to measure productivity across a player’s career as well as win shares per 48 to measure per minute productivity. In the process of analyzing these responses, the position a player plays was also considered as a potentially significant variable, since different positions in basketball are asked to fulfill different roles on a team.

&#x200B;

The following statistics were used as potential predictors:

* Total Games Played
* Games and Minutes Played in Final Year of College
* True Shooting and Effective Field Goal Percentage
* Offensive, Defensive, and Total Rebounding Percentage
* Assist Rate
* Steal Rate
* Block Rate
* Turnover Rate
* Usage Rate
* Points Produced
* Offensive and Defensive Rating
* Offensive, Defensive, and Total Win Shares
* Offensive, Defensive, and Total Box Plus/Minus

&#x200B;

Once models were developed for each of the outcomes above, they were applied to past draft picks in order to see how well they fare in predicting their careers. Rankings of draft picks were created by averaging the player’s ranking among each of the three main response variables based on predictions from the respective models.

&#x200B;

It should be noted that players who did not play in college (ex. international players) were excluded from the study since the basis of the study was the use of college statistics.

&#x200B;

**Results**

|*Response*|*Predictors In Model*|*Significant Predictors*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Years Played|Total Games Played, Defensive Win Shares|Defensive Win Shares|
|Win Shares|Games Played in Final Year of College, Offensive Rating, Defensive Win Shares, Assist Rate, Forward, Forward:Assist Rate|Forward, Forward:Assist Rate|
|Win Shares Per 48|Minutes Played in Final Year of College, Win Shares, Block Rate, Forward:Block Rate|Win Shares, Block Rate, Forward|

&#x200B;

In the table above, the "":"" indicates an interaction term, so for example, Forward:Assist Rate means the assist rate for forwards specifically, as opposed to guards or centers.

&#x200B;

**Conclusions:**

Overall, this analysis provides evidence that win shares in college are a potential predictor of NBA success for second-round picks, as defensive win shares are a significant predictor of years played and total win shares are a significant predictor of win shares per 48. In addition, there is evidence that the success of forwards differs significantly from non-forwards, as forward is a significant predictor in both win shares and win shares per 48. When applying these models to previous second-round picks, they often favored forwards/centers more than guards, especially ones known for their defense. For instance, the models successfully predicted the successes of many players, such as Hassan Whiteside, Draymond Green, and Jae Crowder, but missed on others, such as Khris Middleton and Isaiah Thomas. From a basketball standpoint, the emphasis on defense in second-round picks should not come as too much of a surprise, since second-round players are much more likely to become solid-role players in the NBA rather than bona-fide superstars that a team builds around. Coaches in the NBA are always looking for players who are hard-nosed defenders and are willing to sacrifice their bodies for the team, and players who excel on defense in college seem fit to translate their success into productive NBA careers.

1745,750,(2) Toronto Raptors versus (3) Philadelphia 76ers,"How does everyone see this match-up?  


I think it's very important that the Raptors can play a center who can shoot threes for a full 48 minutes. I also think Embiid's career numbers against Gasol are very underwhelming; being able to draw Embiid out the paint and limit him in scoring is already a bad start for the Sixers. Gasol and Horford are different players but Gasol has a little bit more length and strength.

&#x200B;

Kawhi on Simmons is problematic. Redick has to find somewhere to hide in order to stay on the floor; my guess is that he will be on Danny Green. I don't know how well Green is at creating shots but the Raptors could still potentially try to hunt for that mismatch.

&#x200B;

Harris will need to be very good defensively as Siakim may be a bit much. Butler will have his hands full with Kawhi.

&#x200B;

I overall feel like the Raptors have fewer players on the court to exploit. Lowry may be one potential person but he can hold his own against bigger players.",nbadiscussion

1748,753,Who will be the next head coach of the Brooklyn Nets?,"Kenny Atkinson is out. Jacque Vaughn is the interim. But Durant and Kyrie reportedly want a “big name”. Some of the names we’ve heard are Tom Thibodeau, the Van Gundy Brothers, Ty Lue, and even Gregg Popovich. 

The Nets should have Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving back healthy next season. Caris Levert, Jarrett Allen, and Spencer Dinwiddie have shown some growth and figure to play some sort of role on the team, but could also be used as trade pieces. Joe Harris has been a go-to spot up threat for the Nets, but will be an unrestricted free agent this summer, so it’s unknown if he will be back. DeAndre Jordan was a consolation prize along with Durant and Irving, but has had an up and down year all season long. 

When we do eventually get basketball back, and the Nets bring in a coach, it’s going to probably be a big name. They’re not only chasing championships, but the stars clearly want a big name as well. Question is, who fits the best in your opinion?

1749,754,If the Spurs were to tank...,"I think a lot of us would sell off Lamarcus and Demar and roll with the young guys moving forward were we put in charge of the Spurs. So, I wanted to just run through some potential trades that would do just that.

**Trade 1: Demar to Minnesota**

Minnesota gets: Demar

Spurs get: Wiggins Minnesota 2021 2023 2025 first-rounders (give or take)

Why: Spurs get a load of picks and Minnesota swaps Wiggins for a star player. I typically don't love teaming up franchise bigs with non-shooters but I think the leap from Wiggins to Demar is enough to justify it. Also, the Spurs have probably the best shot of anyone at turning Wiggins's career around.

**Trade 2: Demar to Denver**

Denver gets: Demar

Blazers get: Milsap

Spurs get: Whiteside, Portland 1st, Denver 1st (protected)

Why: Spurs get 2 first-rounders. Portland gets a good PF that can play next to Collins or Nurkic. Denver gets another perimeter guy that can create his own shot. I think Demar should be able to play SF for them and I think Grant should be able to fill most of what Milsap was giving them.

**Trade 3: Lamarcus to Portland**

Blazers get: Lamarcus

Spurs get: Whiteside plus some combination of picks and or young guys.

Why: Same basic idea as last time. Lamarcus is a borderline all-star that is familiar with the system and the guys. I'm not 100% he can play next to Nurkic but I think he can.

**Trade 4: Lamarcus to the Clippers (mid-season trade)**

Clips get: Lamarcus

Spurs get: Mo Harkless, Zubac, Jerome Robinson, and maybe a pick

Why: Lamarcus is much better and more proven than Zubac. I think the Clippers would be hard-pressed to get a better player with their assets and cap space situation. The Spurs get a young center and couple other young lottery tickets.

**Trade 5: Lamarcus to Boston**

Boston gets: Lamarcus and Metu (just to make money work)

Spurs get: Hayward and a pick

Why: Lamarcus should be able to come in and fill like 95% of the Horford vacuum. The Spurs get a guy that it is about 5 years younger albeit more of a question mark. Potentially you could make this a 3 team trade and direct Hayward elsewhere.

1752,757,Most First Overall Picks on One Roster - Quarantine Basketball Reference Findings,"After finding the most former and future MVPs on one team, I became motivated to find the most #1 overall picks on one singular roster. The picks have to have played at least one game together, and only official NBA draft picks are included (no territorial picks).

**The Most #1 Picks on one Team: 1959-1960 Minneapolis Lakers (5 First Overall Picks)**

I assumed a later mentioned Lakers team would take the crown but this team had 5 players all selected with the first pick. Elgin Baylor, Hot Rod Hundley, Chuck Share, Ray Felix, and Frank Selvy. They fell in the Western Division Finals in their only season together. the two seasons after, minus Chuck Share they played with 4 first overalls. All five players were drafted in a 6 year span

**Most Well Known: 1986-1989 Los Angeles Lakers (4 First Overall Picks)**

Easily the most well-known and successful group on this list, for three years they made the finals all three years together, winning two of them. Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy, and Mychal Thompson all being picked first overall, by 3 different teams. From 1982-1991 the team always had at least 3 picks with Thompson joining in the middle of the 87 season. and Kareem retiring after 89.

**Alcindor and Big O: 1970-1971 Milwaukee Bucks (3 First Overall Picks)**

In their only season together, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Oscar Robertson and Bob Boozer brought the Bucks their sole championship. Kareem, then Lew Alcindor took home the League MVP in this being only his second season.

**Twin Towers: 1984-1986 Houston Rockets (3 First Overall Picks)**

With Ralph Sampson and (then named) Akeem Olajuwon being drafted in the consecutive last seasons of non-lottery draft format, John Lucas brought a veteran presence that led to these young centers to the 1986 Finals, falling to the 1986 Celtics, one of the best teams ever.

**McGill Again: 1963-1965 New York Knicks (3 First Overall Picks, 4 Players)**

This is the sole team on this list where they had 3 first overalls, with the third player being different in the seasons. Bob Boozer and Art Heyman and Bill McGill make up the first team with Jim Barnes being drafted the following season and McGill playing on both this team and the next mentioned team in the 1964 season.

**Team Names: 1962-1964 Chicago Zephyrs/Baltimore Bullets (3 First Overall Picks)**

This one is interesting as the Zephyrs moved to Baltimore the following season, becoming the Bullets in what is now the Wizards. Made up of Walt Bellamy, Bill McGill and Si Green, this team was not successful despite Walt Bellamy's stellar performances

**D-Rose and Youngins: 2017-2019 Minnesota Timberwolves (3 First Overall Picks**

Former MVP Derrick Rose was traded mid-2018 season to the Jazz and was waved and signed to to a young wolves team of Andrew Wiggins and Karl Anthony-Towns. Most notably, Rose's career high came in his first start of the 2019 season scoring 50 points. Surprisingly, Anthony Bennett never played a game with two other first picks despite being involved in the bevy of #1 picks involved in Wolves-Cavs transactions in the 2010s.

**AI and DC: 1997-1998 and 2003-2004 Philadelphia 76ers (3 First Overall Picks, 4 Players)**

Allen Iverson, a perennial all star never had big talent around him despite the Sixers housing multiple former #1 overall picks. Derrick Colemen was present on both these teams, spending a 3 season stint on the hornets in between. Joe Smith's first of five career midseason trades sent him to the 1998 Sixers, giving them the two previous years' #1 selections. Glenn Robinson joined the 2004 Sixers as a veteran but both of these teams failed to make the playoffs

**New Showtime Lakers: 2019-2020 Los Angeles Lakers (3 First Overall Picks)**

In the most recent iteration, LeBron James recruited Anthony Davis and Dwight Howard to form a strong core of star power and veteran presence. Unfortunately this season has been halted so it is yet to be seen whether they will add another team with a chip to this list.

**1 Game Together: 2016-2017 Cleveland Cavaliers (3 First Overall Picks)**

Lebron James and Kyrie Irving were joined by Andrew Bogut in a midseason effort to prepare for the Finals. Unfortunately, he was injured in the first minute of his first game on the Cavs, capping his career time on the Cavs at 1 minute.",nbadiscussion
1753,758,Things Giannis can still improve,"Giannis has struggled with his ability to move side-to-side, cut and switch directions, and his overall fluidity in this aspect for quite some time. It hinders his ability to guard players on the perimeter, as well as impeding on his progress as a perimeter scorer. Due to his average lateral quickness, he can't get past defenders using skill and finesse, but rather brute strength and speed. 

And in the playoffs, where teams are playing a physical zone, sometimes pure athleticism won't guarantee you a field goal. But if he were able to move fluidly, and quickly, side-to-side then it would keep the defense active and guessing. Of course, pairing a consistent shot with this would make him virtually unguardable, as he could easily beat his defender off the dribble with his lateral movement, square up, and shoot the shot.

Defensively, it would also unlock a new dimension to his game. Admittedly, he has already noticeably improved in this aspect. But if he had good defensive lateral quickness and not just above average, it would make him arguably the most versatile defender in the league. He's not suitable to guard shiftier players because they're always active and always moving in different directions, and due to his merely above average lateral quickness, he's prone to getting beat off the dribble and just being one step behind. It also prohibits him from guarding the opposing team's best player. 

So, in short, his average lateral movement, quickness, and his overall fluidity in his ability to move side-to-side really impedes on his on-ball and perimeter defense as well as stunting his offensive growth as he trends towards the perimeter. It also hinders his ability to break down a defense using his handle and shiftiness as opposed to raw physicality. 

He could improve this weakness defensively by trusting his length and being more alert and attentive when guarding on the ball, but especially on the perimeter. His screen navigation was also poor but he started to move under the screen and trust his length and straight-line speed to get a good contest and not be screened off. His long strides, defensively, could work to his benefit, as he could beat opponent's to their zone and effectively end the play.

Will he ever be a league-best perimeter and on-ball defender? Of course not. But can he improve, trust his physical tools, and be much more alert and attentive? Absolutely. And obviously long strides aren't great for a perimeter defender, but as I stated in the paragraph above, he can use them to his benefit by beating his assignment to their zone. 

Offensively, I'm a bit confused, as his lateral movement on that end would need to be paired with a shot otherwise he'd simply be beating his man off the dribble and getting an easy dunk at the rim. But as many have stated, this won't work in the playoffs. So this will be virtually exclusive with getting a consistent shot. But who's to say he can't develop both at the same time? As he experiments with different shots, he could work on defenders in isolation situations by using his handle, pulling his dribble back, and shooting the shot. 

It's hard to truly convey into words, but look at other players his size such as Anthony Davis or Kevin Durant and watch their games on film, then compare their film to Giannis, you'll notice they can size up a defense, take opponents off the dribble and knock down a shot, they can cross opponents up, and overall can just play at different paces and get shifty for lack of a better term. Like I stated before, his lateral movement offensively is mutually exclusive with getting a consistent shot. If he, and we all know he does, wants to be a dynamic shot maker, he'll need to improve his ability to take a defense off the dribble, knock down tough shots with consistency, and use his handle to get to his comfortable non-paint zones.

Defensively, it's also about his fundamentals and attention to detail as well playing defense on his toes as opposed to playing flat on his feet or on his heels. Have constantly moving feet, using his long strides to his benefit, and just being more patient. To summarize this to the best of my ability, improving his lateral quickness and movement offensively should be paired with his jump shot development. Defensively, it's much more mental and attention related than it is physically. 

**TL;DR: Improve his lateral movement and quickness offensively and defensively, trusting his physical qualities more on defense, being much more attentive on defense, and using his handle and shiftiness on offense to get a comfortable jumpshot.**",nbadiscussion
1754,759,The Criminally Underrated Career of Kevin Johnson,"Kevin Johnson may just be the best NBA player a casual fan has never heard of, and I just don’t understand why.

Kevin Johnson was drafted with the 7th pick in the 1987 NBA Draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. He played 52 games in Cleveland averaging 7.3 ppg and 3.7 apg, backing up Cavalier great Mark Price. On February 28, 1988 Cleveland traded Kevin Johnson, Mark West, Tyrone Corbin, and a pick for Larry Nance, Mike Sanders, and a pick. Now out of Mark Price’s shadow, it was Kevin Johnson’s time to shine. He finished out his rookie season starting 25 of 28 games for Phoenix and averaging 12.6 ppg, 8.7 apg, and 1.5 spg. Now began the birth of his amazingly underrated career.

Kevin Johnson went on to become the 1988-89 Most Improved Player after his stats jumped to 20.4 ppg, 12.2 apg, and 1.7 spg. With the exception of his atrocious three-point shooting, he was everything you could ever want in a Point Guard. Somehow he didn’t make the All-Star game this season. Even more unbelievable is the fact that he didn’t even place Top-10 in Western Conference Guards voting! As his career progressed his numbers stayed relatively the same for around 9 seasons with his scoring numbers staying around 20 with the exception of two seasons in which he averaged 15.5 ppg and 16.1 ppg. His assist numbers were also near 10 apg yearly. With the help of Tom Chambers and Charles Barkley he was able to help lead Phoenix to the Western Conference Finals multiple times and even caught a date with “His Airness” himself in the Finals. Kevin Johnson finished his career with 1x MIP Award, 3x All-Star, and despite only 3 All-Star Appearances, 5x All-NBA.

One last thing I’d like to point out is that Kevin Johnson’s prime numbers were better than Steve Nash’s MVP numbers. In the 2004-05 Season, Steve Nash won his first MVP averaging 15.5 ppg, 11.5 apg, and 1.8 spg on great shooting numbers while leading Phoenix to a 62-20 record and they eventually lost to Tim Duncan’s Spurs in the Western Conference Finals. The following season he won his second MVP averaging 18.8 ppg, 10.5 apg, and 1.5 spg also on great shooting numbers. This season Phoenix finished 54-28 and lost to Dirk Nowitzki’s Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals. Kevin Johnson in his prime averaged 22.5 ppg, 11.4 apg, and 1.3 spg while leading the Suns to a 54-28 record that led to a loss against the Trail-Blazers in the Western Conference Finals and the next season he followed it up with 22.1 ppg, 10.1 apg, and 2.1 spg while leading Phoenix to a 55-27 record. I’m mot trying to discredit Steve Nash at all because he is one of the best point guards of all-time, but god damn Kevin Johnson was near Steve Nash’s level statwise. I’d argue that if Kevin Johnson was in Steve Nash’s position he’d have both of those MVP’s, but instead he’s fading into irrelevancy if he hasn’t already. Seriously, when was the last time you or you heard someone talking about Kevin Johnson.

Fun Fact: Kevin Johnson was also the 55th mayor of Sacramento from 2008-2016

Edit: Yes, I knew about Kevin Johnson’s sexual predation of underage women, however I find that irrelevant to this argument. I don’t think that really impacted his play. I’m talking about from an in-game perspective. 

Also some of you guys are saying I’m cherry-picking stats. So what? I cherry-picked Steve Nash’s MVP stats as his best seasons and cherry-picked Kevin Johnson’s best seasons. Kevin Johnson played in 735 games averaging 17.9 ppg, 9.1 apg, and 3.3 rpg. Steve Nash played in 1217 games averaging 14.3 ppg, 8.5 apg, and 3.0 rpg. Honestly, Nash was had the longer career and that’s great. When I said Kevin Johnson may be better all-time than Steve Nash, that was kind of just an idea. I don’t truly 100% believe that. However, from a basketball standpoint, in his prime I think Kevin Johnson with Tom Chambers or Charles Barkley was better than Steve Nash with Amare Stoudamire and Shawn Marion🤷‍♂️",nbadiscussion
1755,760,The nature of player development is going to change very soon,"What we think of player development in the NBA is going to change drastically in the next few years . This will positively effect the competitive balance in the NBA and provide an alternative for small market teams . 

Here are some new rules that are coming into play 

1. Draft age is lowering . This allows teams to grab a player straight out of high school and start their development from the get go. 

2. Expansion of the roster size and the addition of two way contracts . This allows teams to protect two additional developmental players . This also allows them to practice with the big squad , play in a few games , and then go back down to the g-league for more refinement . It's a pretty flexible situation for GM's.

3. More and more teams are becoming affiliated with 1 particular G-league team . This means closer control over coaching and management decisions at a lower level . This is vertical integration . 

The point I'm getting at is that the NBA is further developing its ""farm system"" just like you have in MLB . 

I think good management should be able to gain a competitive advantage by investing in player development . It seems each team has so few prospects . Rebuilding in the NBA is hoping you get a top pick a couple of years in a row . Expanding a team's control over young players allows rebuilding teams to take a more shots at getting a player that turns into an NBA level player . 

Furthermore this shift of creating a larger and more organized farm system allows basketball organizations outside of the NBA to react and possibly alter their methodology.

I think this change could spur a lot of exciting development. Especially on the NBA GM side of things ... which I always like to think about

1758,763,[OC] The Chicago Bulls rebuild imploded again this year. How can they pick up the pieces and make it better next time?,"As we continue to wait for real basketball to happen (or not?), it may be a good time to monitor teams that will definitely be missing out on all the playoff bubble hijinks. 

Here's a look at the **CHICAGO BULLS**, with a special shoutout to true Bulls' fans like /u/celsius_two_3_two for helping me review the content.

---

**PART ONE: From Playoff Challenger to *Challenger* space shuttle**

Like any proper degenerate, I like to make a few Las Vegas ""over/under"" bets before the season (note: don't try it at home, it's usually a waste of time and money.) 

Still, a few win totals jumped out at me. Among them: the Chicago Bulls, over/under 33.5 wins. 

Now, the logical move may have been to pound the ""under"" here. After all, this was a team coming off two seasons with 27-55 and 22-60 records. However, I couldn't help but overthink this one. Sure, the Bulls had a very bad 2018-19 season (highlighted by Fred Hoiberg getting fired and Drill Sergeant Jim [Boylen](https://images.app.goo.gl/8LANnxFoysw3Y5jm9) taking over). At the same time, they played better in the second half of the season. Boylen (douche or not) would presumably keep improving their defense. Moreover, Boylen and the front office were on shaky ground in terms of their job security, which usually motivates an organization to push forward and win as much as possible.

The front office clearly had that in mind as well, signing Tomas Satoransky and Thaddeus Young to sizable $10M+ contracts. Neither are *great* players, or perhaps even *good* players, but they're solid and reliable veterans whom the team could immediately plug into a rotation. These Bulls felt deep, balanced, and perhaps ready to strike. After all, star Zach LaVine would be set to enter Year 6 in the league. Otto Porter would be entering Year 7. Some of their other ""young"" pieces weren't that young; for example, Kris Dunn and Denzel Valentine are both 26 right now.

Overall, this felt like a recipe for success. Or at least, semi-success. The Bulls were ready to take a jump. Making the playoffs may have been unrealistic, but 35-38 wins felt doable. ""OVER"" it is!

Flash forward nearly a year later, and I've got so much egg on my face that vegans won't even talk to me anymore. Turns out, these ""new Bulls"" were the ""same ol' Bulls."" They'll end the season with a 22-43 record, which would have put them on pace for 27.8 wins over 82 games, well under the 33.5 set by Vegas.

So what went wrong? How did this potential darkhorse run so far off the rails that it needed to get shot and turned to glue? Let's take a closer look.

---

**PART TWO: Missing Otto Porter III + D**

One of the major reasons the Chicago Bulls disappointed in 2019-20 was injuries. Center Wendell Carter missed time, and Otto Porter III barely played due to lingering hip injuries. He appeared in 14 games, and only drew 9 starts (averaging 23 minutes per game.)

On the surface, Porter shouldn't feel like a huge loss. After all, this is a player who's never averaged as much as 15 PPG in any season in his career and has never sniffed an All-Star team. 

That said, the loss of Porter had a trickle down effect that hurt the team in numerous ways.

Offensively, Porter is a low-usage player who's about as efficient as anyone in the league. For his career, he shoots over 40% from three (40.4%). Better yet, he's only averaged 0.8 turnovers per game (1.1 TO per 36 minutes.) He's what you'd call a role player / *assassin.* He gets in, hits his target, and slips out without being noticed. Porter actually has a little more versatility to his offensive game than the average catch-and-shoot player (he can take you down on the block, for example), but most often, he's used as a spacer and he thrives in that regard. Without Porter's shooting, the Chicago Bulls' offense looked even more sluggish than usual. Their offensive rating ranked 27th out of the 30 teams in the league.

Porter's loss also showed up in other ways. Porter's not a *great* defender -- he's probably ""above average"" -- but that's still an asset to have in your lineup. He's a savvy player who's usually locked in defensively, despite one infamous [*Shaqtin' A Fool*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkwfh_6TG0A) moment. He also has good size and length for his position at 6'8"" with a 7'1"" wingspan.

That size is a key element to this discussion. Porter has ""plus"" size as a small forward. In his absence, the Bulls struggled to fill that void with the same. They ended up shifting Zach LaVine (6'6"", 6'8"" wingspan) over to small forward quite a bit. LaVine played 67% of his minutes at SF this past season according to basketball-reference. You can take those positional play-by-plays with a grain of salt because it's not easy to track and label, but that's still a notable difference in terms of the roster composition. The Bulls were smaller than average at SF, and smaller than average at SG with rookie Coby White (6'4"", 6'5"" wingspan) playing the majority of his minutes there.

The natural follow up to this may be: *so what?* Even with those size limitations, Jim Boylen's Bulls still finished with the 14th best defense (up from 25 last year.) However, the lack of size on the wings helped contribute to the Bulls' problems on the glass. They finished 30th (out of 30 teams) in total defensive rebounds, and 28th in rebounding differential (-3.6 per game). Using rebounding *totals* isn't always the best metric to use because bad teams miss more shots (and thus allow their opponents more rebounds). However, if you dig deeper, the numbers still aren't pretty. The Bulls' grabbed 75.6% of their potential defensive rebounds -- 5th worst in the league. Overall, they grabbed 47.9% of all potential rebounds -- 2nd worst in the league. ""Rebounds"" may be not be an en vogue stat in general, but it's a weakness that still hurt the team at the margins. When you're a mid-level team, those extra few possessions per game could mean the difference between a win and a loss.

The good news? Porter will likely be back and healthy next season. The bad news? He's not cheap. He'll almost certainly pick up his oversized $28M player option. In another circumstance, he may try to rip it up and renegotiate a long-term deal with the Bulls or another team instead, but the murkiness around the cap and around his health makes that too difficult to imagine. Barring a trade, he'll be back with the Bulls next year, and will help the team win a few more games.

---

**PART THREE: Misusing their offensive weapons**

The Chicago Bulls are a young team, built around young stars like Zach LaVine and Lauri Markkanen. Both LaVine and Markkanen have some limitations overall, but they're both gifted offensive players. So given that, how is it that the team only finished 27th in offensive efficiency?

In terms of the national media, a lot of the blame tends to fall on Zach LaVine. After some inefficient play early on in his career, the narrative has stuck that LaVine is an ""empty calorie"" or ""volume"" scorer. However, the results on the court don't really justify that anymore. Sure, LaVine shoots a lot, but he doesn't take as many *bad* shots as you may expect. He takes 8.1 threes per game (and makes an above-average 38%). He takes 5.6 free throw attempts per game (making 82% for his career.) Overall, that's a winning formula. LaVine's efficiency and true shooting is above league-average, no small feat for a player averaging 25.5 points per game this year. You'd like to see him hammer his way to the line even more, but he's not the problem for this team (offensively.)

Meanwhile, Markkanen has some work to do. For a 7-footer, he's a gifted shooter. He shot 42.3% from three in college (and even flirted with 50% early in the season.) He carried that success over to the NBA for his first two years, netting over 36% from three each year. His results at the free throw line (84% then 87% as a second-year player) illustrated his potential to keep improving from there. 7-footers tend to get labeled as ""stretch bigs"" if they can get anywhere over 30% from three; Markkanen has the potential to get closer to 40%.

However, that leap didn't happen in Year 3. Markkanen sagged to 34.4% from three, and ""only"" 82.4% from the free-throw line. But those percentages aren't what bothers me. Percentages will go up and down over smaller sample sizes like that. What's more concerning is how Markkanen's role shrunk offensively. After averaging 15.3 field goal attempts last season, he slipped down to 11.8 attempts this season per game. Even if you account for a few less minutes, he dropped from 17 FGA to 14 FGA in terms of ""per 36"" numbers.

As mentioned, Markkanen is an *offensive* player. He's a shooter. I'm no coaching genius (and neither is Jim Boylen apparently), but I'd encourage a shooter to SHOOT. Because if Markkanen isn't a focal point of your offensive attack, then he's not doing much good for your team. He's not a good defender -- he's not a good rebounder. This is like the Justice League sending Aquaman off to the find evil aliens in the desert; we're misusing his talents here, people.

Practically speaking, the next Bulls' coach needs to rethink the approach with Markkanen. Personally, I believe he has more in the tank offensively than he's been allowed to show so far. Maybe he's not Dirk Nowtizki, but he's still an extraordinary talent as a shooter for his size; I'd make a point of funneling him the ball. And if the problem is that he's getting marginalized by ball-dominant LaVine, then Markkanen should come off the bench as a 6th man scorer instead. He needs to be an offensive priority whenever he's in the game. And consequently, a better offensive philosophy and system needs to be installed in order to allow that to happen.

---

**PART FOUR: Natural growing pains**

When the Chicago Bulls' playoff chances slipped away, Jim Boylen and the front office finally unleashed their rookie, Coby White. 

White took advantage of that greenlight and turned up the gas as a scorer. He'll end the season with a modest 13.2 points per game, but that undersells his impact as a scorer. Per 36 minutes, he averaged 18.5 points per game. That trended upwards over the course of the season as well. White averaged over 20 points per game in February and March (albeit over a limited 14 game size.) If White can do that as a 20-year-old rookie, then it's fair to suggest that he could be routinely scoring over 20 PPG in his prime.

While Coby White has some obvious virtues -- highlighted by his quickness and his cool hair -- there are some natural concerns and growing pains that he showed. He *scored*, but he didn't necessarily do that with efficiency. He shot only 39.4% from the field, and netted only a 50.6 true shooting percentage that's well below the league average.

Defensively, White also struggled. Playing ""up"" at SG for 71% of his minutes (and even at SF for 17%!), White's limited size and limited experience showed. ESPN's real/plus minus metric graded him as -1.9 impact per 100 possessions. If you wanted to count White as a point guard, that would rank 89th best (out of 94 qualifiers.) If you envision him as a shooting guard, that would rank 134th (out of 137 qualifiers.)

That debate -- is Coby White a point guard or shooting guard? -- is an important one. Sure, we're in an era of ""position-less"" basketball to some extent, but players still have certain roles offensively and certain assignments defensively. White's limited size and length (6'5"" wingspan) projects best as a point guard. However, he's more of a scorer than a natural distributor. He only averaged 3.8 assists per 36 minutes this season, not far removed from the 5.2 assists per 36 minutes he averaged back in college at UNC. His playmaking can improve, but he's more of an attack dog by nature.

This combination of strengths and weaknesses makes you wonder about the long-term fit next to Zach LaVine. If the Bulls' long-term plan is to play White at SG and LaVine at SF, then they're always going to be behind the eight-ball in terms of length and rebounding (especially with Lauri Markkanen at the 4.) If their plan is to start White as a point guard, then they're going to have to rely on LaVine to be more of a lead facilitator, or on the entire team to adopt more of a ball-moving offense 1-5.

Most realistically, White projects best as a super-scorer off the bench, a la Lou Williams. To excel in that role, he'll need to continue to draw more free throws (he was at only 2.0 FTA per game as a rookie), but the potential is there to improve his shot selection and become a big-time scorer. Staggering White and LaVine would also allow them to be aggressive as scorers without stepping on each other's toes.

---

**PART FIVE: Done with Dunn?**

The other reason that it'll be important for the new Bulls' coach and front office to devise a long-term plan for Coby White is because it will affect other decisions on the roster. Among them: the fate of Kris Dunn.

Like Coby White, Dunn has some extreme strengths and weaknesses -- they just happen to be in opposite order. He EXCELS defensively. He has a big frame (6'9"" wingspan) and natural instincts on that end. He nabbed 2.0 steals this season in only 24.9 minutes of action. A lot of times, ""steals"" can be misleading because they amount to gambling. For Dunn, it's more reflective of his actual talent. He has extremely quick hands; he could have made a lot of money as a gunslinger back in the Old West. In some ways, he reminds you of Andre Iguodala on the ball defensively, combining length, strength, and savvy.

The rest of Dunn's game is a mixed bag. He's not a bad distributor (averaging 6.0 assists in both 2017-18 and 2018-19), but he's a poor shooter. He's also had injury issues flare up over the course of his career. As mentioned, he's already 26 years old, so it's unrealistic to expect him to become a wholly different player in the next few years. With Kris Dunn, you mostly know what you're getting to get. So the question is: do you want it or not?

The Bulls will have to make that choice this offseason, as Dunn enters his (restricted) free agency. There's a chance that COVID will infect the cap and allow them to retain him on his one-year qualified offer of $7M. Alternatively, there's a chance that another team will swoop him and sign him to an offer sheet. He'd make some sense for a team like the Detroit Pistons, who could invest in him as an heir apparent to Derrick Rose at PG. If a team like that offers Dunn a deal in the 3 year, $8-10M per year range, will the Bulls match it? TBD.

Again, a lot depends on their views regarding Coby White. If they envision White as a future starter at PG, then there's less of a need for Kris Dunn. The Bulls would be able to start White at PG as soon as next year, with Tomas Satoransky as a combo guard off the bench and Ryan Arcidiacono serving as a third point guard and insurance policy. If the team envisions Coby White as a SG (or combo guard off the bench) then there's more of a need for Kris Dunn to platoon with Satoransky as a lead guard.

This game of musical chairs may be getting more crowded, because there's also another element at play: yet-another lottery pick.

**PART SIX: Drafting some Help**

Currently, the Chicago Bulls are slated in the # 7 position in terms of the NBA Draft order. They have a 9% chance of moving up to # 1, and a 32% chance of moving into the top 4. If they can make that leap, then that would mean adding another potential star to the fold. It's not a strong draft by any stretch, but SG Anthony Edwards (Georgia) and C James Wiseman (Memphis) have the potential to be good starters. If they can land someone like that, you ignore ""fit"", take the potential stud, and work out the rest later.

More likely, the Bulls will be picking in that 7-8 range. That's still a good pick, of course, but not one that should cause you to throw the baby out with the bath water and ignore the composition and needs of your team. 

Again, this is why the ""Do the Bulls need a PG?"" question becomes so critical. This is a poor draft, but it's strongest in terms of its point guard depth. According to ESPN's draft experts, 5 of the top 13 prospects are point guards (LaMelo Ball, Tyrese Haliburton, Killian Hayes, R.J. Hampton, Cole Anthony). A few of those -- namely Hayes and Anthony -- are ""pure"" point guards who don't have enough size to switch around and play minutes at the 2. 

Among the crop that's likely to be available around pick 7, here are some potential fits.

PG TYRESE HALIBURTON, IOWA STATE (# 8 on espn). Haliburton is one of the easiest ""fits"" for the Bulls and for basically every team, because he offers a versatile set of skills. He's technically a point guard (averaging 15.2 points and 6.5 assists last year) and can capably fill that role. Better still, he can be effectively off the ball. His three-point shot looks a little wonky, but he converts it well, hitting 42.6% of his threes in college. Defensively he's got good size (6'5"" with a 6'10"" wingspan) and instincts (2.5 steals, 1.3 fouls last year). In a sense, Haliburton can be a ""3 + D"" point guard that plays alongside a ball-dominant player, be it Zach LaVine or Coby White. If the team drafts him, you figure it'd be with the intention of using him as an upgrade on Dunn (slightly worse defense but better offense.)

SG DEVIN VASSELL, FLORIDA STATE (# 16 on espn). Like Haliburton, Devin Vassell is another player who could fit well on virtually every team because of his 3+D potential. He's hit 41.7% of his threes in his two years at FSU with a good-looking form that's aided by good size for his position and a higher release than Haliburton. Right now, Vassell is listed around 6'6"" with an estimated 6'10"" wingspan, but he looks bigger than that to my eye. That's crucial because it would allow him to play both SG and SF and draw some different assignments defensively. I also like Vassell's personality off the court; he seems like a good kid that should continue to improve. Like Haliburton, Vassell is the type of player that should easily into a lineup with LaVine and/or White.

SF DENI AVDIJA, ISRAEL (# 5 on espn). I'm not going to pretend to have as much confidence in my projection of Avdija, who's played in the international youth circuit and has been a rising star with Maccabi Tel Aviv. Based on what I do know, he could be an intriguing boom/bust pick around # 7. He's a big forward (6'9"") who can convert inside, and better yet, has a real knack for playmaking. The Bulls' young stars -- Zach LaVine, Coby White, Lauri Markkanen -- are all better scorers than passers right now, so perhaps Avdija can operate as a de facto point forward and help the offense click into place. Right now, his shooting results have been shaky though, so he's not someone you can just throw out there and tell to stand in the corner as a 3+D option. If you take him, you need an actual plan to highlight his skill set. The Bulls' top exec Arturas Karnisovas is from Lithuania originally, so you presume that he'd have no qualms about selecting an European like Avdija (whose dad is Serbian) if need be. Of course, that logic didn't quite work out for Sacramento GM Vlade Divac and Luka Doncic.

SHAKIER FITS. Alternatively, there are some players in the Bulls' draft range that may not be ideal fits. As mentioned, Killian Hayes and Cole Anthony are more of traditional ball-dominant point guards; I don't love the idea of that next to Coby White and Zach LaVine. I'd also be wary of Dayton's PF Obi Toppin. Toppin has strong scoring potential with a decent shot and good athleticism inside. That said, he's a little stiff in the hips defensively, and may duplicate Lauri Markkanen in that regard.

---

**PART SEVEN: Buh-Buh Boylen**

One of the Chicago Bulls' biggest decisions will be among their first. Technically, the new front office has not fired coach Jim Boylen yet, but it appears that his clock is ticking on that decision. It's only a matter of time.

Candidly, Boylen gets too harsh of a rap from national media and fans. He's not a *complete* asshat. He's had success as a defensive assistant in the past, and did help the Bulls' defense improve some over the past few years. He'd be a fine assistant coach somewhere in that limited capacity. 

However, he does seem woefully out of his depth as a *head coach.* He's never had success in that role before, and he didn't have any now. His offensive system is virtually nonexistent, and his attitude is boarish. Usually those ""Drill Sergeant"" coaches get a short-term year or two of improvement from a young team, but he couldn't even do that. We need to pull him out of there before there's a full-on *Full Metal Jacket* rebellion here.

Looking ahead, the Bulls need to pick a coach that can get the team back on track, especially in terms of their offensive philosophy. That said, the Bulls have to be careful not to ""zigzag"" too much in their coaching hires. They went from Tom Thibodeau (the gruff, defensive-heavy coach) to the Anti-Thibodeau in Fred Hoiberg (likable, low-key former player), and then jumped on the seesaw again with the complete opposite in Boylen. There's always a tendency to go for the *opposite* of your last coach, but presumably there's a happy medium in between these two poles. Goldilocks was happy to find something ""just right,"" so Karnisovas should be as well.

According to media reports, **Ime Udoka** is a top candidate, and would be a natural fit. While Udoka doesn't have head coaching experience yet, he's about as ""ready"" as any first-time coach would be. He's a former player, and a long-time assistant under Gregg Popovich in San Antonio (and now has worked the last year in Philadelphia.) The Spurs' philosophy is an ideal template for the Bulls to use, both in terms of their offensive ball movement and their locker room culture.

I'd also recommend **Kenny Atkinson** as a viable candidate. He didn't mesh with the new superstars in Brooklyn, but he'd done a great job prior to that in terms of rebuilding a broken Brooklyn team. He specializes in pace and space offense, and player development. That sounds ideal for this team right now.

There are a few other candidates out there that would be worth interviews (Chris Finch, Wes Unseld Jr., Chris Fleming, Nate Tibbetts, Alex Jensen, Dave Joerger, etc) but Udoka and Atkinson represent a very solid top two. Hiring either of them would be a great first step for this new administration.

---

**TL;DR**

The Chicago Bulls' ""breakout"" didn't happen; instead, they broke down. However, the foundation isn't bad here. If the new front office *wants* to push for the playoffs next year (manifested by keeping Otto Porter and continuing to play veterans) then it's not unrealistic that they can get up to 35-40 wins with better health and a better offensive system. Conversely, the team may decide they're further away than that, and take a step back to collect their bearings.

&#x200B;

**Tool:** [https://nbadraftcomp.herokuapp.com](https://nbadraftcomp.herokuapp.com)

&#x200B;

I recently developed an NBA Draft Comparison tool that has gained a good amount of popularity on Twitter by several draft analysts and on /r/NBA_Draft

&#x200B;

The tool retrieves similar physical, statistical (per40), and advanced stat comparisons for any player dating back to the 2000 NBA Draft based on their position

&#x200B;

**Per 40 stat comparison** can be found here: [https://nbadraftcomp.herokuapp.com/stats](https://nbadraftcomp.herokuapp.com/stats)

&#x200B;

**Advanced stat comparisons** can be found here: [https://nbadraftcomp.herokuapp.com/advanced](https://nbadraftcomp.herokuapp.com/advanced)

&#x200B;

**Physical comparisons** can be found here: [https://nbadraftcomp.herokuapp.com/measurements](https://nbadraftcomp.herokuapp.com/measurements)

&#x200B;

**A visualizations page** which visualizes how a player compares to their position can be found here: [https://nbadraftcomp.herokuapp.com/visuals](https://nbadraftcomp.herokuapp.com/visuals)

&#x200B;

Note: Advanced stats only go back to the 2011 Draft and **there are currently no physical comparisons for some of the 2020 prospects as the combine hasn't reported official measurements**. Additionally, **if you cannot find a player in the stats, visuals, or advanced pages you can enter their sports-reference url and the site will generate the comparisons then**.

&#x200B;

If you end up seeing this, any feedback/comments/suggestions that you have or would like me to add a feature to the website is something that I'd appreciate a whole lot. You can dm me here but preferable on twitter:youngwizzydfs and I will respond asap.

1760,765,The Bucks are dominating the regular season so far,"The spread for the Knicks/Bucks game was 16.5 points in the Bucks favour last night, yet me and all my buddies still chose them for good reason.

The Bucks have only lost 6 games this season and five of them have come to teams that sit at 6th or better in their conference:

- Boston (2)

- Miami (3)

- Philly (6)

- Dallas (6)

- Jazz (2)

- Spurs (9)

Yeah they're 36-6 and that's incredible, but an often overlooked part of great teams is their ability to defeat their lesser opponents on a consistent basis. The Bucks have done that and more.

In the last 2 months, the Bucks' average [point differential against playoff teams (9 game sample size) is +10.0 PPG](https://twitter.com/JGosseSports/status/1217418102532714498). On the season its +7.41 PPG.

They are not only rolling over bad teams, but they're (on average) beating playoff teams handily too. 

The Bucks looked to be finals-bound last season before losing 4 straight to Toronto. With the Bucks being the clear-cut favourite out of the East and the best competition being the Celtics, could we see a finals appearance or even championship from them this season? Or is this regular season success going to mean nothing when teams have whole gameplans to thwart Giannis just like the Raptors last season?

1762,767,"The NBA.com ""all-decade"" teams had some really bad choices(for reasons I point out in this post). What are your all-decade teams from 2009 to 2019?","Ok, so the panel of analysts from both [NBA.com](https://NBA.com) and NBA TV voted for the 15 best players of the past decade. They were going to be divided in three teams, that consisted of 2 backcourt and 3 frontcourt athletes each. Here are the results:

&#x200B;

* All-Decade 1st team: Stephen Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard.
* All-Decade 2nd team: Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony, Anthony Davis and Blake Griffin.
* All-Decade 3rd team: Dwyane Wade, Kobe Bryant, Paul George, LaMarcus Aldridge and Giannis Antetokounmpo.

Notable players not mentioned (that I remember): Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Dwight Howard, Chris Bosh and Kevin Love.

&#x200B;

Now, the main problem with this list are the fowards selected outside of the 1st team. I get KD, LBJ and Kawhi on the 1st team. All won championships, Finals MVP, notable regular season awards (MVP, DPOY) and have great playoff sucess.

&#x200B;

However, what's the point for Melo and AD over Dirk and Duncan? The first two have almost no good playoff moments. Melo had great numbers and memorable performances, but they were all in the regular season, when games aren't as important. He also only made the playoffs three times in the past ten years, and in only one of them he got past the 1st round. Davis' greatest acomplishment was sweeping the Blazers in 2018 only to lose in 5 on the WCSF.

&#x200B;

Dirk and Duncan, however, have won championships, made it to the playoffs multiple times, have been great until like 2015-2016, and helped a lot their teams win games. Duncan was still an awesome player by the time the Spurs won the Heat in 2014. Dirk had one of the greatest playoff runs of all-time in 2011. Does someone have one single reason to put Aldridge, Blake, PG, Giannis, AD or Melo over those two?

&#x200B;

Also, what is the argument for Giannis or Aldridge over Bosh? LaMarcus made the playoffs a lot of times in the past 10 years. But, he never got too far in the postseason, only in 2017, and also don't have crazy good numbers. Giannis has only been a top-tier player like Lebron for the past two seasons, and his last year was the only one he had a top-4 record. Bosh was one of the greatest players of this era. He was a key part of the big-3, undoubtedly an All-Star until his last season with the Heat. We've seen also two really good years of his without LBJ on the squad and he was still really good. I feel like Bosh's awesome 7 seasons with the Heat are more than either Giannis or Aldridge have done.

&#x200B;

This is how I would've organized this list:

&#x200B;

* All-Decade 1st team: same as the [NBA.com](https://NBA.com) one.
* All-Decade 2nd team: Dwyane Wade, Russell Wesbrook, Dirk Nowitzki, Tim Duncan and Chris Bosh.
* All-Decade 3rd team: Chris Paul, Kobe Bryant, Paul George, Blake Griffin and Anthony Davis.

I also decided that Wade was greater than Russ. I know Westbrook's 2017 season was historic and all, but Wade was a really good player until he left the Heat for the Bulls in 2016. 2 rings, was a superstar until 2011, and has done more in the postseason than Brodie. The last spot of the fowards on the 3rd team was given to AD, but you can put either Melo or Aldridge over him and I'll understand.

1765,770,[OC] An In Depth Look at D'Angelo Russell - film analysis and advanced stats,"As a long time lurker on r/nba, I wanted to contribute with an in-depth analysis on one of my favorite players in the league. Given the talk about trade offers and packages surrounding D’lo, I thought now was a good time to post this. D’Angelo Russell has been one of my favorite players since he was drafted in 2015 with the 2nd pick. As a Warriors fan since the 2008 We Believe team with my East team being the Nets, I’ve been lucky enough to watch a lot of highly skilled players play for both of my teams. I believe D’Angelo Russell is underrated by the general fanbase of both Warriors and NBA as a whole and I’ve included a variety of  strengths, weaknesses, misconceptions, and highlights to back my argument. I’ve also included a deeper look into the advanced stats and the picture of the player that D’Angelo has the potential to become.

Let's start with his vision. D’Angelo Russell is one of the best passers in the league and there aren’t many players I would put above him in terms of court vision. He can make almost any type of pass and he is very creative with his passing. Let’s break down what makes him elite.


&nbsp;


Starting with [transition...](https://streamable.com/yfxar) D’Angelo Russell is great in transition. He takes his time and always seems to have a mental picture of how players are coming down the floor. He will slow down and make the right passes in delayed transition to streaking bigs, or he’ll whip a no look pass to the player cutting backdoor as he pulls the defensive attention. Even when he doesn’t actively push the pace with his handles, his outlets are sharp and accurate and delivered with a surprising zip behind them - keeping it flashy often both with look offs and no looks. He’ll also drop it off or leave it for the trailer when appropriate.


&nbsp;


When holding the ball early in the shot clock, D’Lo doesn’t dictate how he wants the offense to set up too often. He carefully surveys the floor and will make [quick, early passes](https://streamable.com/z3cal) when his teammates pick up a sliver of an advantage. He is great at finding these tight windows and seeing his teammates open. Playing with a guard like this encourages the whole team to cut hard knowing you’ll be hit when you’re open. He is also great at finding shooters. [Imagine if these passes are going to Curry and Klay](https://streamable.com/8u70o). He is unselfish and many times will have the touch swing pass to the open shooter so quickly the ball is almost never in his hands.


&nbsp;


That brings me to my next point - D’Angelo is one of the best guards in the league at hitting teammates **in stride** and in the perfect window on cuts… [in addition to throwing the defenders off with where his eyes are looking.](https://streamable.com/i2je9)


&nbsp;


If you caught the end of the last GIF, then you’ll know what’s coming next. D’Angelo Russell is one of **THE BEST** lob passers in the NBA today. [He’s got every lob in the book](https://streamable.com/gr41j), and he’s showing out with lob targets like WCS, Paschall, Burks, GR3, Green, and Chriss. He can pass both directions with either hand; he can pass across his body with his off arm and opposite his momentum; he can hit oop targets from half court and look them off; he can alleyoop under hand on the drive, chest passes from 30 feet; he is so deadly with the pull-up 3 that bigs need to slightly hedge the screen and if the big slips and the defense is a step late, D’Lo will have already fired a pass for a dunker. He can get to the midrange and put his defender in jail, draw the help who are playing against his floater, and lob a soft pass over their arms. He will throw alley oops in transition if someone is a step late to streaking bigs.


&nbsp;


However his best pass isn’t his lob - I would say it’s his [pocket pass to rollers in the PnR.](https://streamable.com/lcxly) If you were familiar with D’Lo in college, you might remember [this clip.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JofVWECgfU) He is a wizard with bounce passing and splitting defenders. It is almost surgical the way he repositions and resets screens until the angle is just right for him to rifle a pass between someones legs for an easy dunk. Harden is another great pocket passer but one thing that D’Angelo clearly has over him - the comfort of using either hand, and passing either direction. His pocket passes are a thing of beauty.


&nbsp;


**Measurables/Athleticism:**


&nbsp;


Here are some of the measurables that we can compare to the average NBA guard. According to DraftExpress, the average height of a guard for both SG and PG is about 6’4 with shoes. The average wingspan is 6’7 and average max vertical is 36.4"". D’Angelo Russell is above average in all measurables. He stands at 6’5 with shoes with a measured wingspan of 6’9.75. This wingspan was measured at age 19, and judging by some pictures I would not be surprised if this has grown to  6’10 or even 6’11. The usual age for wingspan to stop growing is around 21 or 22 for males. His max vertical at the combine was 39"". I am sure that this number is shocking to some as Russell is not known as an athletic player, but here are some names around the NBA known for their athleticism with similar vertical numbers at the combine:


&nbsp;


John Wall - 39""


Andre Iguodala - 34.5""


Jimmy Butler - 39""


Russell Westbrook - 36.5""


Blake Griffin - 35.5""


&nbsp;



Is [this](https://streamable.com/2k6f0) what an [unathletic](https://streamable.com/i804f) guard [looks](https://imgur.com/EgJSCn9) like?


&nbsp;



I am not arguing that D'Angelo is athletic in comparison to other NBA guards. I am acutely aware that max vertical is not what we see in a high level basketball game and it’s rare to be able to elevate to your max in a competitive environment. I am also aware that D’Angelo rarely shows off his athleticism. However, I believe this is a deliberate, stylistic choice in how he chooses to play the game and utilize his strengths. He is almost always in control both with and without the ball. He is always very careful in setting up his positioning in the half court and will take his time to reposition screens to use them to their highest effectiveness. In this way, he reminds me of James Harden who also doesn’t explode off your computer screen with his athleticism although it’s clear that they both possess it. Another part of athleticism that is not as easy to see is deceleration. D’Angelo has elite deceleration and can stop on a dime and get into a jump shot as [smoothly](https://streamable.com/h1ikn) as anyone else in the league. Seriously, check out how tough that shot is.


&nbsp;


 The main two things I see missing in terms of athleticism are:


1. Slow lateral movement making it easy for other guards to blow past him.

2. Lack of a quick, explosive first step to allow him to blow by his defender easily. More on this later.


&nbsp;


**2019/20 Season Advanced Stats and Changes Adjusting to the Warriors Offensive System:**


&nbsp;


In the 2019/20 season, D’Angelo Russell will be **24 years old** in his fifth season. His averages on this season are **24/3.6/6.3/1** in 32 mpg.


&nbsp;


As a D’Angelo Russell fan, I knew his game came with a lot of pull-up jumpers and was heavily reliant on his pick and roll threat to get to most of his spots. I believed he would not be able to contribute off ball as much as he already has this season and thought it’d take much more time to get accustomed to the Warriors brand of basketball. Through 30 games for the Warriors this year, I no longer hold this bias and I am getting increasingly excited to watch him to play alongside Klay and Curry.


&nbsp;



Some key areas of improvement over last seasons All Star berth:


&nbsp;


- Increase in **FTA** from 2.5 to **4.4**. This is a key increase that is necessary in increasing efficiency and becoming a star guard in the league. The top guards all are able to draw FT at a respectable rate and he has more than doubled this.


- Shooting **72% at the rim** with cuts off the ball and [crafty finishes like this](https://streamable.com/a8b5x). This is the 100th percentile for guards and could be a bit of a fluke. When he gets to the rim this season he has been elite at finishing. However, it’s a career low attempts at the rim. Only 8% of his attempts are within 4 feet of the basket. 

- Lowering **TOV%** every year since entering the league, down to a **career low 11.8%** from 15.6%

- D’Angelo is shooting **51% from long mid-range** classified as 14 feet out to inside the 3 point line. This is in the 91st percentile in efficiency and when taking into account the volume of midranges that D’Angelo takes,  he can only be compared to **Chris Paul** who’s also having an amazing season from midrange. As a reference, **Kevin Durant** shot 51%, 49%, and 54% (WOW) from the  same distance in his 3 years with the Warriors.

- Increase in 3P% from 36.9% on 7.8 attempts per game last year to **38.3% on 9.4 attempts per game** this year. This is an increase in efficiency and also volume! Breaking down the 3P% leads to even more interesting improvements.

- When D’Lo is [coming off a screen](https://streamable.com/pexqy), the Warriors are scoring at **1.11 PPP**. He attempts 2.9 shots a game off of this type of shot. For context, Paul George leads the league at 3.8 and D’Lo’s similar company in attempts would be **Buddy Hield**, **Joe Harris**, and other shooters known for their off ball tendencies. The efficiency can be compared to **Paul George** and **JJ Redick** at 1.12 and 1.14PPP respectively. Compare this to last year at 0.83 PPP on 0.7 attempts per game, it’s a huge bump in efficiency and scoring while more than quadrupling the attempts.

For contextual reference for all further PPP stats - in the 2019/2020 season, the Mavericks are leading the league with 1.16 PPP, Bucks are second with 1.14 PPP. League average is at 1.09 PPP.


- In **spot up** situations, his ability to function as an off ball player is even more apparent as it rises to a **1.30 PPP - in the 95th percentile amongst other elite shooters**.  

- D’Angelo Russell shot 39.4% on **catch and shoot** 3’s the previous year. The number of attempts was 3.3 per game. That number has skyrocketed to a flaming **42.4% on 4.1 attempts per game**. Here are some samples of what these catch and shoot 3’s [look like](https://streamable.com/pexqy). These are not normal difficulty catch and shoots. These are **difficult** catch and shoots that are shots created through off-ball movement and threat to shoot. The sets are similar to the ones used to set up Klay and Curry for off ball shots and are coming full sprint to turn and square in the air and shoot while the defender is trailing. 


- **Isolation** shots: Similar attempts per game at **2.3** to other offensive stars like Paul George, Trae Young, Bradley Beal, and Devin Booker. He scores at **1.03 PPP** in these situations similar with players like **Kawhi Leonard**, **Trae Young**, **Luka Doncic**, and **Kyrie Irving**. The ability to create a shot with a live dribble is always essential to a lineups offensive potential and also is a great bailout shot when you aren’t able to get to what you want. He’s shooting **36%  on pull up 3’s at 5.4 a game**!


&nbsp;



**Offensive Team Impact:**


-  **93rd percentile in assist percentage** - this is  the percentage of shots he assists teammates on while on the floor


- When D’Lo is on the court, he **increases the Warriors eFG% by 4.6%**! This is 97th percentile in the NBA. Yes, this can be attributed to the fact that his backup is probably not at an NBA level. It is still a huge increase. He also increases the number of 3’s shot  at a +6% frequency, which is in the 95th percentile. For someone with his  shot profile ( a lot of midrange shots), you would expect the team to shoot more midrange when he’s on the floor. This is the opposite, the team shoots 2% less midrange and 6% more from 3 because of the shots he is able to generate for teammates.


- Team shot accuracy at the rim +7.0% - 97th percentile

- Team shot accuracy at short midrange +7.7% - 94th percentile

- Team shot accuracy at long midrange +7.9% - 90th percentile.

- Team shot accuracy at all midrange +7.6% - 98th percentile

- **These are not fluky numbers, these percentage increase and percentiles show similar improvements over the last 4 years of his career.**

- His offensive BPM (OBPM) is at 5.1 this year which would put him 11th in the league. This stat is a good indicator of offensive prowess as we can note from the top 10 that they are all cornerstone pieces in the elite offenses in the NBA. This stat puts him significantly ahead of players like Butler, Anthony Davis, and Lowry while being on par with Jokic, Kemba, and Beal on offensive contribution.

- He has the [clutch gene](https://streamable.com/2gqtp). Patented celebration for clutch shots so early in his career.

- Just a [tough shot maker](https://streamable.com/n03k5). The degree of difficulty of a lot of his shots is extremely tough.

- Additionally, he has a [great pump fake](https://streamable.com/ovai4) that allows him to lose the man closing out on him and relocate to an open three pointer.

- Speaking of [relocation](https://streamable.com/29heq), D’Angelo has learned from Steph Curry the art of relocation after driving and using off ball movement to get the ball back for open shots that were generated from his initial drives.

- He has the ability to catch fire and carry an offense for quarters at a time. He can go supernova, he just has the ""it"" factor stars need in the NBA.

&nbsp;


**Defense:**


&nbsp;


As I traced D’Angelo’s defensive issues this year,  I categorized them into three main issues


1. D’Angelo gets nullified by screens easily both on and off ball. His inability to fight through is apparent.

2. D’Angelo is [unable to catch up laterally with the first step and is never able to position himself between the offensive player and the rim leading to an easy layup](https://streamable.com/k2za8)

3. D’Angelo is [not hustling](https://streamable.com/is4rm), either in transition not sprinting back or just looking lethargic in closeouts. He even makes Joe Ingles look nimble.


However, his low DRTG can also be partially attributed to hot shooting by the man he  is guarding. Opponents are shooting 44% from 3 against Russell - almost 8% points better than their average. The numbers are uncharacteristically fluky across his career and while I’m sure it can be  partially attributed t o Russell’s  poor defense and lack of hustle, but  at  such an  outlier,  it’s clear that  luck is also  playing  a big part in bringing down his defensive numbers. In his two years in Brooklyn, he did alright defending the perimeter,  but like the eye test suggests, he was horrible at stopping players from scoring at the rim and showed an inability to stay between them and the basket.


There were a few positives I noticed from Russell’s defense as well.


1. [In this clip](https://streamable.com/8c38u),  D’Lo sees Green fall for the pump fake. As Chriss rotates as the primary help, he leaves behind Tristan Thompson wide open for the dump off. D’Lo sees this so he takes two quick steps to box out Tristan, leaving his man open in the corner but taking  away the wide open dunk. He then recovers to his man for an OK contest.

2. [In this clip](https://streamable.com/0wfhk), Myles Turner has sealed his man and is wide open for the lob pass for an easy two.  D’Angelo spots this and stunts hard towards Turner, taking away the initial pass. He then sees his man get swung the ball and attempts to deflect it out but misses and gets scored on.


&nbsp;


Although he gets scored on in both clips, they both showed a defensive IQ and awareness to take away the highest percentage look. What’s missing is the hustle required to turn these smart plays into stops.


&nbsp;


[Some more positives here](https://streamable.com/idjtr). Russell has great wingspan and a good percentage of his steals are from surprising the other team with his reach, getting deflections and steals that  seem unexpected.


&nbsp;



[He also shows good defensive timing](https://streamable.com/76y76) akin to Andre Iguodala when he’s able to position well and contest drives.


&nbsp;


**Areas of Improvement:**


&nbsp;


There are several areas of improvement that need to happen for D’Lo to take the next step


Biggest Weaknesses:


&nbsp;


Slow  lateral movement, easily blown by - hopefully with his decrease in usage, he is able to use more energy on defense and live up to his potential on that end. He has been in the top USG% in the NBA the past 4 years. Additionally, hopefully playing for a winning team with a winning culture will help him realize what kinds of hustle plays are expected day in and day out of the 82  game season. He’s still early enough in his career to be able to make a  drastic change on that end. He has been at the top of the Nets in deflections and loose balls controlled and I want to see him bring that same hustle here.


&nbsp;


Labeled as a chucker - I believe that his shot profile will change dramatically after adding back Steph and Klay.


&nbsp;


[Careless turnovers](https://streamable.com/xkgv4) - This reminds me of Steph Curry but there is a tradeoff in creativity, passing, and freedom on the court that will result  in silly turnovers at bad times. This has to be cleaned up similar to how Curry had forced himself out of  those bad habits earlier in  his  career. Remember those bets with Mama Curry? Some of that would be great here.


&nbsp;


Not a good FT shooter - for how amazing a shooter D’Lo is, he doesn’t have  that same consistency at the line


&nbsp;


Shot a career low in the short mid-range from 4-14 feet. In 4 years before GSW, he shot 45%. This year it’s down to 38%. I think this is an anomaly that will bounce back given D’Angelo’s [great and varied floater game](https://streamable.com/qvzhe).  He really demonstrates nice touch on these floaters and they’ve been a staple of his offensive game since he joined the league.


&nbsp;



**Can he work in a system with Steph and Klay and Green?**



Imagine D’Angelo as the trigger man at the top of the key, with Steph and Klay coming off of down screens on either wing. Any wrong action by the defense (over playing  the shot if Curry or Klay get a step) can result in a lob  pass for a dunk to the screener or hitting two of the best shooters in the game for a catch and shoot. Now also imagine D’lo being one of the shooters coming off of the down screen and getting swung the ball with the options to shoot, pass, or drive. He’s already shown in just 1/3 of  the season that he is able to contribute as both an off ball player and a ball distributor in Kerr’s system. Adding the pick and roll with D’Angelo as a floor spacer, or the  guard running the pick and roll with two elite spacers and a great secondary playmaker in Green as the roll man is also another wrinkle that can be worked into the offense.


&nbsp;


In conclusion, I think D’Angelo will fit nicely along with the Warriors future plans and the trades being offered now are not at all worth a  24 year old PG with so much potential. He fits well in the offensive system and has the pieces needed to elevate his defense to the level needed as well. He has become a deadly off ball player and it will be exciting to see the future with the three guard lineups. Even with a mediocre to average defense, I can see their offense setting record numbers and winning them a lot of games. No one is arguing he is a plus defender now, in fact the exact opposite is true. With being on a disciplined winning team culture, cutdown in usage with the return of two all stars, and a bolstered team defense, I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt until he's proven he won't change. He is still just 23.

1766,771,Should Jimmy Butler's foul-drawing game be getting more attention?,"I've noticed in the past month that Butler has been getting notably high amounts free throw attempts this season. Checking bballref shows me that Butler is heading to the charity stripe for 9.4 FTAs per game (12.9 Per-100)

A FTr of **68%**, 34% higher than Harden this season (who is continually attacked despite taking just over 10 more shots than Butler this season). Harden still has the edge Per-100 (15.2). Heck even Harden's highest FTr in a season was only 58% in his 16-17 season (still 17% less than Butler this season).

I don't catch Miami games, but I don't think Butler being undisputed leader of his own team again would account for these numbers despite getting calls decently in years past. What's different this season? Ref calls and rule changes, or Butler improving his game even more and generating more defensive attention?",nbadiscussion
1767,772,LaMelo Ball and RJ Hampton are ready for the NBA.,"Literally omw home from the Breakers-Hawks NBL game.

Some thoughts:

* LaMelo really has most of the playmaking instincts of Lonzo. Made some great passes and reads but some his teammates weren't ready/didn't see the same thing

* He attacks more than Lonzo but isn't really a good finisher through contact. Runs in the family I guess

* He needs to be given the keys to the offense to be effective. They tried running offball plays for him but he preferred to pull back and create himself...

* Speaking of which, yeah he's gonna have trouble breaking his opponent down in the pros. He has dribbles like Zo, not enough to gain separation

* His go to is his stepback 3 but I saw him grab his right knee alot, maybe he has an injury? Most of his threes were short

* defense is still bad. 

Hampton on the other hand:

* quick as fuck. He was the quickest dude on the floor. He just needs to do it consistently.

* shot is suspect. There were times when opponents would go under screens and he never took a shot.

* needs to play with confidence. He looks like he played with extra motivation tonight, given the matchup. It played in his favor.

I think Melo goes top 3, Hampton is a lotto to mid-first.

Fun game to watch no doubt.",nbadiscussion
1768,773,What are everyone’s unpopular opinions about the upcoming season?,"Personally, I really think that the Rockets are going to perform well below everyone’s predictions and it will be solely blamed on Russell Westbrook. For the same reason that people say KD took away from Steph’s prime, I think that people will say the same about WB to Harden this upcoming year. He’ll play well, but I think their play styles will not fair out okay together considering both of their high usage rates. I think that the Rockets will benefit from having two MVPs on the court at the same time, but that the West is still extremely stacked and Westbrook will not perform well alongside Harden. I believe that the Rockets will fall anywhere from the 5th seed to the 8th seed. 

Along with that, I also believe that amongst all of the heavy MVP candidates such as Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Giannis, LeBron, etc., that Jokic will actually win it. I think that the Nuggets are going to run it back again, except with vast improvements from Murray and Jokic. If the Nuggets attain the top seed in the loaded Western Conference, I think that he’ll get the same Giannis narrative as last year and win the MVP award. 

I wouldn’t call both of my opinions unpopular, maybe more so unlikely, but I would like to hear about what people think that personally that others may not agree with. I think that an overall discussion about our predictions, thoughts, or opinions on the upcoming season would be a good insight to what to expect.

There are so many serious questions around him that don't have a single unanimous or a clear majority supported answer looking at the relevant reddit threads and perhaps it isn't such a black and white issue or maybe some sides are misunderstood.

1773,778,[OC] How Luke Kennard is Bringing a New Hope to the Detroit Pistons,"*Quick side note before I get into this. I realized my title was a play on a Star Wars movie. I've never watched Star Wars. Kind of an accident and I'm not creative enough to think of a new title so deal with it.*

Back in 2017, the Detroit Pistons were on the clock with the 12th pick in the NBA Draft. Analysts would spend most of that time discussing how surprising it was for Malik Monk to fall all the way to 11. Rece Davis will manage to sneak in a quick 30-second briefing on how the Pistons would need a shooter and with 1 minute and 30 seconds remaining, Adam Silver was on the stage to announce that the Pistons had selected Luke Kennard.

There would be polite clapping. Muffled cheers, no boos. He would embrace his family, embrace a Donovan Mitchell that would soon hear his name called and make his way to the stage.

Jay Bilas would talk about Kennard’s footwork, discuss his range and drop a comment of, “He will be able to hang.” It was a comment that most fans would understand—that he wouldn’t be embarrassed on the national stage—but not a comment that would provide comfort for fans.

He wouldn’t be a true starter for sometime. Stuck behind Avery Bradley, splitting minutes with Langston Galloway his first year, stuck behind Reggie Bullock and Bruce Brown while still splitting minutes with Langston Galloway in his second, he waited. 

And during a late October evening of his third year, Dwane Casey gave him the nod to earn the full-time gig. Citing offense struggles, Kennard would be seen as the man to remedy the issue. Scoring 59 points in the first three games, including his career high of 30 on night one of the NBA, Casey had every right to believe in the former Duke player.

In his first start of the season against Indiana, he would hit 5 out of 11, 3 out of 6 from three, assist on 4 and more importantly, be  a +10 in the second win of the season for Detroit. It was the start of something.

Luke Kennard has been subject to a lot of discussion early in his career. Being the guy that was picked before Donovan Mitchell comes with consequences. Was he just going to be another white guy from Duke—that would just come in and shoot threes? Was he going to be able to make it at the next level? 

And at the start, it felt like he would be. He would average 20-minutes a game, coming off the bench. You could rely on him for a couple of threes a night. Clearly he wasn’t Stan Van Lundy’s favorite but if you would watch him play, there was some character to his play. Fans of the college level would remember that Luke Kennard had to be the foil for players like Grayson Allen, Jaysn Tatum, Brandon Ingram while still developing his own personality. He would let his play speak for itself, quietly having nights where he would pop-off over 30 points but you wouldn’t even blink. 

Kennard was much more than just a shooter out of college but an offensive threat. His ability to drive often went unnoticed, as well as his ability to pass the basketball. He was very much capable of creating his own shot but would have to earn his team’s trust. For his first year in the NBA, 70.4% of his shots made were assisted. This year, its only 60.2%. He would also receive the label of being a catch-and-shoot guy—taking 62% of his shots after holding the ball for less than 2 seconds. Now, only 47.2% of his shots are taken in that span of time.

He has aged extremely well in a relatively short period of time. The question is…how?

It starts with a couple of lucky breaks. The Blake Griffin trade back in January of 2018 was the start. Avery Bradley’s minutes suddenly became available. It also resulted in the departure of Tobias Harris. The re-invented ‘Blake of the Year’ candidate would provide a different look to the 4. He would be more ball dominant, have the ability to force defenders to guard him across the court as he developed a three point shot. It also meant that the Pistons would look to generate more opportunities for teammates around the perimeter with the combo of Griffin and  Andre Drummond. 

Luke Kennard would luck out again with a coaching change. Van Gundy did not initially fancy the guard from Duke. Despite providing optimistic commentary for press conferences, his search for confidence from the guard often times would be met with the lack of providing confidence as a coach. While Van Gundy would warm up to the guard, praising his offensive ability and provide more opportunities for the guard, we wouldn’t see the next steps in the relationship of Kennard and VG as Dwane Casey would step up to take over the job as head coach.

Still coming off of the bench, Kennard would slowly develop more and more. Casey’s coaching style and bench management would help improve Luke’s confidence. Unfortunately, injuries to his knee and shoulder would plague his second season with in the association. Casey would make the move to have Kennard play more and more of the small forward position while working him back into the line-up. He would go from a 29% of his gamete being at the 3 in year 1, 82% usage at the 3 in year 2. It was a small change but a change that helped open line-up management. The two biggest questions were the 2 and 3 for Detroit—why not have a guy that could play both in an effective manner?

Which brings us to this year. This year is just different. The second year is often the most important year for a coach. Casey has taken all of the information from his first year in Detroit, made his adjustments and put together his vision of the future.

He started with making a lot of adjustments to his backcourt. The draft choice of Sekou Doumbouya, trading for Tony Snell signaled the search for depth in the wing. But with injury luck, it didn’t harm Kennard—he was able to split time in the two with Langston Galloway or Brown and could take minutes from Snell and Svi Mykhailiuk.

Casey would also develop a system with a lot more offensive flexibility. With Blake wanting to take on a bigger role, Casey would have to react. He would implement three systems:

The first was the usage of two high screens: the first of which would open one player to receive the ball at the top of the zone and the second to open up said player for a drive or an open view of the court at the top of the key.  

Next would be the usage of a similar two-man game with stacked side of the court. Often times, it would be the easiest way to get the screen-and-roll game going but also create options for players that would inevitably collapse on the drive—creating a wide open three. 

And then there is the high-post low-post game—where Blake holds the ball at the top, Drummond sits in the low post and players work their way around the court to get open—often times involving Griffin acting as a wall with a ball. 

The offensive schemes have worked—Detroit is surprisingly the best team from behind the arch, shooting 39.2% on 32 attempts a game. But interesting enough, they’re one of the most efficient teams in the league. They only average 84 shots a game will and have shot 47% from the field. They’re slow—again, towards the bottom in pace (98.81) and methodical—having a turnover percentage of 16.7%. 

It also leads to Detroit drawing a lot of fouls. Because of how much the team moves, utilizing a lot of cuts to the basket to the basket and the style of play that has been brought together. Drummond’s work on the boards, Detroit’s ability to draw contact at the basket have both been incredibly important to opening up the offense end.

Detroit is slowly figuring things out on the defensive end. Again, not the best defensive team out there—they’re at least disciplined, averaging towards the bottom in fouls as a team. Because of concerns over the ability of some defenders on the team, Casey has brought in a take on the zone defense—which has also allowed from Drummond to continue to be the rim presence he’s been requested to be. But truthfully, questions about Kennard’s ability to be a defender at the next level have been exaggerated. He hasn’t been terrible, often doing a solid job at staying with defenders. 

All of these systematic changes have truly benefited Kennard. He isn’t expected to play fast, he isn’t expected to be a catch-and-shoot guy despite having one of the most beautiful strokes in the association right now. Instead, he’s able to create space for himself. He’s able to play his game of basketball.

His shooting splits tell the story, 56.3% of his shots from the field are classified as open or wide open—meaning there is 4+ feet between him and the closet defender. He went from being a 41.3% catch-and-shoot type of player in his rookie year to a 31.5% catch-and-shoot rate. Now, he mostly focuses on his pull-up game, which has been great at using his offensive IQ to find space and ensure he’s taking the correct shot. Kennard has opened his range—taking 147 from 24+ feet out but what has also been intriguing is his use of the mid range. Because of the spacing on the floor and Kennard’s sneaky handles and football, he’s able to stop on a dime.

Let’s look at a couple of examples of what Kennard has been able to do.

[Drummond sets the high screen and Brooklyn plays the drive fairly well](https://youtu.be/bUw59wh2cV8?t=223). Kyrie Irving does a good job at fighting through the screen and cutting off the possibility of the straight roll from Andre—even if it was a lazy roll to begin with. Kennard steps towards the center and checks two things: if Andre is rolling and how Kyrie is attacking. Coming in off balanced, Luke is able to pump fake Irving on the shake, bait out Jordan onto Andre and hit a silky smooth mid-range jumper.

[The Pistons settle in for a half-court overload](https://youtu.be/rMR6gbgJGP8?t=176). Kennard receives the ball and again, Drummond will be the one to set the high screen. The remaining members of the Pistons are settled around the arch—ready to receive if a defender collapses onto Kennard. Even with a collapsing defender, Kennard is able to get in an easy floater. 

[And of course, human wall Blake Griffin and Kennard work again from the overload](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qKhgBgGc2Q). Instead, Griffin simply uses his body to create space for Kennard. There is efficient passing that works the Hornets defender who originally missed the assignment but the ease of how Griffin was able to create the shot for Kennard simply shouldn’t go unnoticed. 

Even some of the simple things he’s able to do look good. —[keep his head up in transition but also have the awareness that he’s really good at shooting the three and the Pacers give him a wide open look](https://youtu.be/ZsDTnXbh-U8?t=96).

Kennard has quietly been one of the best things going in the east. Despite not being the signature guy you would look at in the Pistons line-up—a line that should receive praise of Derrick Rose continuing to do Derrick Rose things, Drummond playing well and Blake Griffin being Blake Griffin, Kennard is playing an integral role for the Dwane Casey offense. His flexibility in roles while still playing the same game is simply fun to watch. And since his move to the starting line-up, he hasn’t been the burden that was once thought of him.  

He isn’t the best player on the Pistons. This isn’t a piece stating that Derrick Rose’s performance hasn’t been helpful, this isn’t a piece saying that Blake Griffin isn’t providing a case to be one of the best 10 players in the NBA. Luke Kennard simply has been one of the most important players on this Pistons team—mostly due to his ability to show how great of a natural scorer he is. He’s been the player that has allowed for Griffin/Drummond line-up to work. He has been the player to allow for Casey and staff to test what their backcourt should look. He’s going to be the player that allows for Sekou to enter the line-up and transition into the NBA in a manner that is much easier for the bright talent out of France.

Down the line, there will be questions of ‘can he take it to the next level’ and there aren’t signs that Kennard has reaching his ceiling just yet. The concern could be, how much time will it take to figure out where the ceiling is? With how valuable the wing is in the modern NBA, having a good one is a blessing. Kennard’s skill set is something valued by most and could lead to him being a trade piece for Detroit’s search for something bigger. But quietly, he should be off-limits. 

He’s shown that he is more than a role player and someone that serves a starting position in the association. The question is, will Detroit realize his value to the team instead of looking for the next thing.",nbadiscussion
1774,779,Re-examining the Terry Rozier Contract,"As we know, Terry Rozier signed a 3 year, 58 million dollar contract with the Hornets as a part of the sign-and-trade deal involving Kemba Walker. I’ve heard many people call this contract the worst of 2019 Free Agency period, a take which I believe is ridiculous for many reasons. In some ways I actually heavily like this move by Charlotte. I’ve outlined my reasons 

1. Charlotte was about to lose Walker for nothing. They had a gaping hole at the starting PG position and there weren’t many viable options out there, especially considering their lack of an attractive market. 
2. Rozier is only 25 years old and matches up well in age with the rest of the Hornets’ young core.
3. While Rozier has had a turbulent time in the league numbers wise, his 2018 postseason numbers (16.2, 5.6, 5.2) were no fluke. He’s shown the potential to lead and put up nice numbers when he’s given full control of a team, and Charlotte will give him just that. 
4. This contract is only three years, and the Hornets aren’t competing for anything anytime soon. Not to mention much of they have money to spend with much of their albatross contracts coming off the books the next two summers. 
5. Rozier would be heavily compelled to re-sign with Charlotte should he transform into a starting-caliber guard (a huge conditional, but still a very valid point). Remember that much of his trouble in Boston was due to the fact that they never prioritized him. Loyalty clearly matters to him. 

All in all, this is a very low risk, high reward move to me. If Rozier doesn’t perform, you can cut your losses and move on. If he does, you have a franchise point guard on a rather nice salary considering the max deals that have gone out. This could very well end up being a steal for the Hornets once all is said and done. I just don’t see why many were calling this the worst signing of FA when I personally believe Harris and Middleton signed worse contracts given their respective roles on their teams.",nbadiscussion
1775,780,The best part about the bubble: removing the worst 8 teams,"To me the best part about the bubble so far is that a majority of the games so far have been great matchups. The parity right now is a lot of fun to watch. Even though there are obviously some lesser talented teams they are all playing to win.

This has really highlighted how awful the race to the bottom is in the NBA. These poorly functioning franchises need to be punished in some way instead of being rewarded for tanking. I am not sure what the solution is. To me the best approach exists and it's the European Football model of relegation. Otherwise, I am not sure what can be done.",nbadiscussion
1776,781,Theoretical D'Lo for Ben Simmons Trade,"If D'Lo continues to ball out (and the 6ers continue to forget how to score), this trade surprisingly makes a lot of sense as a (probably year end) trade.

6ers take it as if this side crashes and burns Elton will make a move, and if it crashes and burns the sides fit will be a big culprit (particullary Simmons). A balling out D'lo (if he continues his current production for most of the year)suddenly gives the side a true ""perimeter"" PG and a closer, whilst opening up their spacing. Defence would take a hit, but the additional offence (particullary closing) may offset this for the better.

GS does it as they decide that the Curry/D'Lo backcourt leaks too many points (despite how many point they score), and they struggle to guard sides with big wings (Lakers). Ben boosts their defensive matchups a lot, as he can take the opponents main forward (with Draymond free to float, and Klay on the better guard). GS's offence and Ben would also help each other, with Ben able to operate as a true ""point forward"" within their motion offence (the side would have insane potential for ball movement), whilst also benefiting from the additional spacing allowing him to attack the rim.

Factors with both sides evaluating positions would probably mean this would need to be an end of season trade (cash works better then as well, given simmons salary will allow for matching), and both sides still come out with a potential franchise player who helps them compete immediately.

Obviously this could fail in a few ways (side valuations of players, 6ers sort offence out, Warriors keep D'Lo etc) but if the 6ers don't click what are peoples thoughts on this as a future trade?",nbadiscussion

1778,783,"The future of Ingram, Lonzo and Josh Hart in the Pelicans jersey","Recently there's kind of a trend that young players have their breakout seasons after leaving Lakers. Worked for D'Angelo Russell in Brooklyn jersey (even made an all star team in just one season removed from being a Laker) as he was traded there with such low value that he was added as a chip in Mozgov salary dump trade. Julius Randle took another huge leap in production in his season with Pelicans passing 20ppg mark and adding solid three point shot to his repertoar, Zubac had more than decent end of the season with Clippers and we're also waiting for his first full season for Clippers (though he never got a real chance in Lakers jersey and when he got those chances played really well). In some manner it can be applied to Thomas Bryant who playing for Wizards proved he can be a serviceable and efficient big man in 20mpg played there posting decent stats and more importantly was high energy guy with great rim running and solid rim protecting abilities. If we want to stretch the theory it can include Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance had their best seasons last year (although in pretty weak Cavs team) So basically even it's completely normal for young players to develop with more minutes all of these players showed progress across the board.

So, Ingram and Ball had some injury issues and in some moments showed that they can develop into very good players. Ingram showed progress in each of his seasons and although he shot worse from three point range his overall FG improved and maybe this can be the season that he'll break the 20ppg barrier if he stays healthy and gets his  three point shot at least on league average. Ball even as young player played good defense in both his seasons as a Laker but to be a pro basketball player (even more so guard) and shoot 40% from foul line is inexcusable. Also him missing almost half the games across two seasons played isn't a good look for him. As he has a glaring weakness in his game fixing that even to an acceptable percentages would mean him taking a big leap in productivity. And lastly Josh Hart took a step back in efficiency last years while posting roughly the same numbers in all statistical categories. He came into the league as a collage senior so his sealing might not be as high as for other players here but as in his rookie season he shot 40% from three point range he can be an useful player in today's NBA where floor spacing in a must have asset. 

Do you guys think that some of these players will break out and did Laker organization gave up on those young players to easily because of win now mode they went into when signing Lebron?",nbadiscussion
1779,784,"Ben Simmons Is a Center, Not a Point Guard","FULL ARTICLE: https://www.theringer.com/2019/5/9/18537564/play-ben-simmons-at-center-philadelphia-76ers-joel-embiid


1. The 76ers have a Ben Simmons problem. He has gotten worse as the playoffs have gone on—from averages of 17.2 points and 7.6 assists against the Nets in the first round to 9.4 points and 4.6 assists against the Raptors in the second. The same thing happened last year, when he played like a superstar against the Heat and was invisible against the Celtics. There’s a simple explanation, one Philadelphia can no longer ignore: Simmons can dominate on talent alone against lesser competition, but the holes in his game get exposed against elite teams. And nothing about that will change until the Sixers change his role. The truth is Simmons has spent his first two NBA seasons playing out of position. He’s not a point guard; he’s a center.



2.The equation changes in the playoffs. There isn’t much that Simmons can do against teams that can control the tempo of the game, pack the paint, and take away his ability to drive. The 76ers run an unorthodox offense in the regular season to maximize the abilities of their young star: They were tied for no. 2 in the NBA in the percentage of their offense that comes from dribble handoffs (8.2), and in the bottom two in the percentage of their offense that comes from pick-and-roll ball handlers (11.5) and roll men (3.5). Those numbers normalize in the playoffs: Dribble handoffs have dropped to 6.1 percent of their total offense, while the percentage that comes from ball handlers in the pick-and-roll increases to 15.3. It all goes back to Simmons. Philadelphia isn’t running as much offense through him against Toronto as it did in the regular season.



3. The downside of making that switch is that Simmons doesn’t have much to do. There are a lot of possessions where he brings the ball up the court, gives it to Butler, and then hangs out on the baseline. His poor shooting means that he can’t play on the perimeter without the ball in his hands, and the lack of shooting around him means that he can’t make cuts to the basket, either. Butler has encouraged Simmons to be more aggressive on offense, but the way he’s being used doesn’t give him many avenues to funnel his aggression. The result is a player who looks passive and indecisive. Simmons has not made an impact on the series: The 76ers have a net rating of minus-5 in his 178 minutes on the floor.



4. There is a Plan C, one that would move Simmons off the ball and still allow him to contribute on offense: using him as a 
 screener in the pick-and-roll. That role would unlock the best aspects of his game and keep defenses from sagging off him. Simmons would have a counter for everything—he could post up smaller defenders if they switched the screen, roll to the rim and catch lobs against a drop coverage, and make plays in four-on-three situations if they blitzed the screen. He could be a bigger and more athletic version of Draymond Green with more scoring ability. A player can be only as good as the role that he is used in. Draymond wouldn’t be anywhere near as valuable on a team that played only conventional lineups. Spending time at the 5 is even more important for Simmons because he can’t shoot. He wouldn’t have to become a role player. He could do everything that Draymond does while also averaging 20 to 25 points a game.



5. The obvious solution is to go small with Simmons at the 5. However, they haven’t gone to those lineups much: They have a net rating of plus-11.2 in 39 minutes in the regular season, and minus-16.8 in 14 minutes in the playoffs. The sample size in each of the Sixers’ playoff series this year is tiny: Those lineups were plus-37.0 in nine minutes against the Nets, and minus-136.4 in five minutes against the Raptors. What happened in the Brooklyn series is fascinating, though. Philadelphia closed the fourth quarter of Game 3, which Embiid missed with a knee injury, with Simmons at the 5. It was the best game of his playoff career: He finished with 31 points on 11-for-13 shooting, nine assists, four rebounds, three blocks, and two steals. Look at how much space he has on these plays:




6. Simmons has the physical tools to play at the 5. He’s one of the most versatile defenders in the NBA: He’s guarded D’Angelo Russell and Kawhi Leonard this postseason; there’s no reason that he couldn’t hold his own against even the biggest centers, too. Simmons towers over both Draymond and P.J. Tucker, the two small-ball 5s in the second-round series between the Warriors and the Rockets. That said, it wouldn’t be an easy transition. Draymond and Tucker were second-round picks who fought their way into the league. They were willing to do whatever it took, even if it meant giving up their bodies to bang against bigger players in the paint. Simmons would have to be willing to do the same, and he would have to learn how to protect the rim and quarterback the defense. It’s unglamorous work that a 22-year-old who was taken no. 1 overall in the draft might not want to do. Simmons might need to learn the hard way through repeated playoff failures before he’s willing to change his approach to the game.",nbadiscussion
1780,785,A meta-discussion on how we define the GOAT,"During a recent Bill Simmons podcast episode, I was inspired by Chuck Klosterman’s attempt at hashing out how different people perceive the Greatest of All Time (GOAT) debate, in light of the never-ending Jordan vs LeBron argument that has been percolating since the release of the documentary The Last Dance. In response to this, I have put down my own list of what I think are the most common definitions NBA fans use when they debate about the GOAT. The players mentioned under each definition are NOT who I think the GOAT should be. Rather, they are simply examples in order to better understand the definition and what they inherently reward and punish as a result of how they were phrased.

1. Earned the most accomplishments

Rewards: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar

Punishes: Kawhi Leonard

This definition rewards players who have accumulated the most amount of awards and recognitions throughout their careers. All-NBA teams, All-Star appearances, MVPs, etc. all add up to a great basketball resume. This benefits someone like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, whose ability to maintain such a high level of competence for as long as he did resulted in a basketball reference page that few can rival.

However, this may prove unfair for players who have had shorter careers but whose peak can rival anyone else’s. A player like Kawhi Leonard, whose recent playoff successes and style have catapulted him to being compared to the likes of Michael Jordan, may lack the hardware and track record of most of his peers because of how late he blossomed and his propensity for load management.

2. Greatest moments

Rewards: Kobe Bryant

Punishes: Moses Malone

Sports is fundamentally an emotional experience, despite the wave of analytics that has pervaded the conversation in our modern day. A reputation of a player like Kobe was built on such moments—from his countless game-winners to his final 60-point performance—and what mattered more than his efficiency (or the lack thereof) was how you felt watching him in the moment. 

Some players, despite being statistical darlings, never elicit the same type of feeling. Someone like Moses Malone seems to take a hit in this definition, who despite being one of the most prolific rebounders in the history of the NBA, never captured the public's imagination in the way this definition looks for.

3. Most Diverse Skillset

Rewards: Kevin Garnett

Punishes: Reggie Miller

The objective of the game is to win and the more skills a player has in his arsenal, the more ways he can contribute to winning. Scoring is perhaps the most important part of basketball but nobody is exempt from going cold. This definition rewards players who can bring the most to a game, be it defense, rebounding, playmaking, etc. A player like Kevin Garnett came into the league possessing an incredibly unique skillset and found ways to impact the game beyond his scoring. 

On the other hand, some players may have developed a reputation (deservedly or not) as one-trick ponies, who despite doing what they do at an absolute elite level, are perceived to have fewer ways of contributing when their number is checked. An example of this archetype is Reggie Miller, who made his reputation as being one of the greatest three-point shooters of all time while also being one of the most clutch. Obviously, Miller is not as one-dimensional as sharpshooting specialists like Kyle Korver or JJ Reddick, but relative to the GOAT conversation, there are aspects of his game that the general public did not get to see as much.

4. Most Unstoppable

Rewards: Shaquille O'Neal

Punishes: LeBron James

In contrast to having the most diverse skillset, this definition rewards player who could not be stopped. You knew what they were going to do every single time, but no game plan or scheme would truly prevent what was coming. One of the best examples of this is probably Shaquille O’Neal, whose reliance on strength and agility to dominate whoever was in the paint compensated for the fact that he virtually had no perimeter game (or even a mid-range game) to speak of. And yet, what was the point for him trying to get crafty with his dribbling if he could just plow through everyone in sight?

The opposite side of this argument is someone like LeBron James. Now, obviously James is an incredible talent, probably the most versatile player in the history of the game. However, this versatility can be framed as a weakness in a very constricted sense, where the plethora of options he has in his command can ironically be detrimental. The worst version of a gunner like Kobe is shooting his team out of the game. Meanwhile, the worst version of LeBron is him “overthinking the chess match” to the point of indecision.

5. Closest to the Ideal

Rewards: Chris Paul

Punishes: Steph Curry

This definition prioritizes those whose style best resembles what we traditionally expect from the position, whether it be a center who dominates the paint and rebounds or a point guard who gets everyone involved. The best exemplar of the latter was Chris Paul. Nicknamed the Point God, Paul was able to achieve the right balance of elite scoring and playmaking that basketball traditionalists expect.

Opposite to this are the players who have largely made their mark outside of these strict definitions, fundamentally changing how the game is played. The most recent example of which is Steph Curry, whose incredible range and off-ball gravity has changed how defense is played and redefined what constitutes a good shot from a bad shot. Critics however would ask how can he be considered the *best* point guard if he isn’t even a *true* point guard?

6. Best stats

Rewards: Wilt Chamberlain

Punishes: Steve Nash

Statistics do not tell the whole story and work better as supplements to what the eye perceives. However, the further we are from bygone eras, the more we rely on statistics to inform us of the greatness of these players. And when talking about statistics, nobody comes close to Wilt Chamberlain, whose eye-popping scoring records almost always dwarfs the next runner-up. If the purpose of the game is to score the most number of points, then a man who *averaged* 50 for a season is surely the best at playing it? 

Of course, the counterpoint to this line of thinking would be someone like Steve Nash, whose relatively mediocre stats can never fully encapsulate the effect he had on the game. Controlling the pace of the game, getting his teammates involved, and essentially being an offense unto himself, are some of Nash’s abilities that will never reflect in the box score but will nevertheless be things that cement his legacy for some.

7. Won the Most Rings

Rewards: Bill Russell

Punishes: Jerry West

The championship is what everybody aims for at the end of the day and the person who played a prominent role to claim the most number probably has a good a shot as any in being considered the greatest of all time. Bill Russell’s eleven rings may never be rivalled, and that fact alone may have some pundits put him in a class of his own. 

However, not every player can play with the calibre of coaches and teammates that Russell was blessed with. There are some like Jerry West who became (in)famous for constantly losing in the Finals despite doing *everything* he possibly could to win. This was symbolized best when he was named the only Finals MVP to win the award from a losing team. How much can you really fault a guy for losing a game when it is a team sport at the end of the day?

8. Greatest Floor-Raiser

Rewards: LeBron James

Punishes: Tim Duncan

Basketball will always be a team game, and one person can never truly win it all. Still, there are some players who have shown the ability to drag the least amount of talent around him into winning situations by doing virtually everything for the team. No other player exemplifies this than LeBron James, whose 2007 Finals run began his reputation as someone who could leverage his versatility to compensate for any of his team’s deficiencies. There is only so much a player can achieve alone, but James may have done the most with the least.

However in this framework, a player like Tim Duncan would be punished quite a bit, even if it isn’t necessarily his fault. We never saw Duncan in a bad situation as he was always flanked with a stellar coach and supporting cast his whole career. But to his credit, he was likely the foundation that ensured that the team was always in a position to compete night in and night out. But some would find it difficult to see him in that light if they never saw him tested the way others have.

9. Overcame the greatest challenge

Rewards: Dirk Nowitzki

Punishes: Kevin Durant

Greatness must be tested in order for us to truly gauge what they are made of. And following that logic, shouldn’t the player who overcame the greatest challenge be considered for being one of the greatest? This definition will be biased towards those who played for underdogs and found a way to defeat the seemingly invincible foe. One of the biggest upsets in modern times is the Dallas Maverick’s 2011 run. Led by Dirk Nowitzki, the Mavs were able to defeat the Miami Heat, who employed the most villainized super team of the era. 

Meanwhile, many have criticized Kevin Durant for taking the “easy way out” when he moved from Oklahoma City Thunder to rival juggernaut Golden State Warriors, who were fresh off winning a record 73 wins. Some would even go as far to argue that KD’s two rings will always be less valuable than Dirk’s lone title.

10. Greatest Delta

Rewards: Michael Jordan

Punishes: Larry Bird, Magic Johnson

It is impossible to compare players across eras because of all the hypotheticals that one must consider in order to do so. Every era has its best player but how can you objectively compare each of these best players while accounting for pace adjustments, the analytics boom, hand-checking rules, among other things? Hence, this definition looks more at who had the biggest gap (or the delta) between the best player of an era and the rest of the competition. Jordan had a few rivals back in his day including Charles Barkley, Clyde Drexler, Karl Malone, among other greats. However, none of them could truly challenge him for the throne in their time. 

This is in contrast with the 80s era where both Larry Bird and Magic Johnson duked it out for supremacy. One could argue that it was exactly this rivalry which elevated their game to greater heights. But unfortunately, this definition punishes them for being unable to separate themselves from one another to settle the debate once and for all.

…

Obviously, the answer to the GOAT conversation will always involve a combination of all these definitions in some order or ratio. But the point really isn’t about answering the debate once and for all. This exercise is meant to help us reflect on what each one of us prioritizes as sports fans, and the real point of this debate is to tease out what we value and which player best fits these ideals of ours.",nbadiscussion
1781,786,Why does Chris Broussard have so much clout? (Rant),"Broussard is my least liked “analyst” by a mile. He always seems wrong to me, why is he on every show and seems to be respected? To me he always tries to sound smart but in reality is just a fake/ liar/ phony. Other analysts such as Skip Bayless also have terrible takes. But when Skip is hating on Lebron (my favorite player) for example, it’s because he’s an emotional fan, and it’s genuine, passionate bias which I can respect. Whereas Broussard makes some stupid shit up and then goes “my sources”. Broussard isn’t even comical like Stephen A or Shannon either. Broussard is also a huge Lebron apologist and I still don’t like him.

  
Off the top of my head, some dumb things he’s said in recent years  


1. Mark Cuban running around Houston going door to door to try and find DeAndre Jordan
2. Claiming he and KD texted back and forth for hours

Ok this one is more speculation on my part but I feel like Broussard made this one up too... Broussard has all the incentive to make the false claim, while KD had no reason to say “you dont have my number” if it was true  


3. The Kawhi free agency saga

This one is documented pretty well in this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhL38Uq7MSo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhL38Uq7MSo)  but basically

* every day he picked a different team that Kawhi would go to, whether Raptors, Lakers, or Clippers
* Said 95% going to Lakers and Clippers are out
* Said Kawhi was a Kobe fan growing up, and then Kawhi says he didn’t care about the Lakers, he was an Iverson fan...
* Kept emphasizing Kawhi doesn’t want to play in Toronto’s “weather” but Kawhi when asked about it “we practice indoors, if we go outside I just wear a jacket”. Broussard also had said Kawhi could play in NYC or Philly which have the same weather as Toronto...
* Claimed that drake would make Kawhi an executive producer on his next album

4. Criticizing Harden’s high scoring

This one is the most annoying to listen to. This season and last Broussard every week says something along the lines of “You can’t win a championship with James Harden playing that way, the highest scoring average of a championship player was Jordan at 31.6. Kobe averaged 35 and didn’t win, Jordan averaged 37 and didn’t win.”  
This is literally the definition of correlation =/= causation. It would be as dumb as saying “Kevin Durant can’t win a championship playing without Patrick McCaw”. Broussard doesn’t offer any other points as to why Harden’s playstyle is bad, other than basically saying nobody has done it before. Is he really trying to say Harden needs to score less? Since when is 31.6 a magic number? Why doesn’t he get into how when Kobe averaged 35, he was playing with Smush Parker and Kwame Brown. Or how when Jordan averaged 37, he played with a bunch of nobodies (no Pippen yet). Harden averaged 36 and now 39 playing with Chris Paul, Westbrook, Eric Gordon, Capela, and always like 5 other guys averaging double figure ppg... It’s like trying to say that averaging over 31.6 ppg will be to the detriment of your team which is the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard. Harden certainly may not win a championship but it won’t be because he scores too much, it’ll be some other factor (like running into GSW every year)

5. Telling Lebron to “be like Muhammad Ali”
 - during the China fiasco, since Lebron backed down Broussard said Lebron should have been like Ali standing up to being drafted to the Vietnam war.  Except difference is Ali was actually being racially oppressed by the US government while China hasn’t hurt any Americans. Besides the fact that Broussard doesn’t know shit about Chinese politics, Ali can stand up against issues in his OWN country, but telling Lebron to go against a FOREIGN government? Lol

  
Anyway I know this isn’t really basketball discussion lol so idk if appropriate but I thought it was relevant since Broussard is a prominent media member and voter. Please add on anything else I missed",nbadiscussion
1782,787,I feel guilty as a fan....,"I don’t know if this is a post for this sub but I will try to keep this  as short as possible.  Basically I have had A mix motions this whole offseason. I’m a Nets fan and you know we got KD and KYRIe. It’s a great opportunity we have and I’m excited. 

  I just still feel upset over players we lost this summer. I have loved the team for years since I was a kid. I don’t want to leave it’s just last years team unfortunately gained me some personal connections to players and dreams I wish we had. I also admit I have envy on guys on our team which adds to this. Like for me if some guys do good this year I really feel some guys on our fanbase will brag about how they were the reason why we got KD and discredit certain guys from last year and the fansbase will kill them. 

  Again I’m excited now and should. KD has been causing drama lately, but I always respected his game. He can be my favorite  player. I like Kyrie  too but admit he is overrated at times by fans. But I like him and get he is better than D lo now. So we have a great team and like guys like Prince and  Jordan as additions as well. feel I am just different in my approach and so used to be the underdogs as a Nets fan and NY sports fan in general. I don’t mind having stars but idk I just don’t know if I see NY in them. I don’t think NY teams should be about excitement. I like a team that plays hard like the SB Giants or the 90s Knicks. I feel we had something growing  last year and we kind of lost this identity. 

 I will accept it cause we have two stars which is statistically what it takes to win, I just feel we could tried to keep a gritty NY team that didn’t need to get band wagoners. It’s hard and I know I could post this maybe in personal subreddits, r/nba, and the Nets sub but the Nets sub will hate the opinion and r/nba as well. Hope someone can relate to what I am saying. It’s a battle with my love of the team with personal attachments inside that I grew attached too and feel envious  in a Way.",nbadiscussion
1783,788,"Harden, Gobert, and the gimmicky Jazz defense.","**TL/DR: Gobert and co are doing a good job inside the paint. They are getting killed by HOU's passing, shooting, and transition game. Quin pls stop!!!**

In UTA's gimmick defense, Gobert is responsible for defending against Harden in the paint. The foundation of this gimmick is funnelling Harden into Gobert. The defender at the point of attack, Rubio or O'Neale primarily, is giving Harden a free lane to the paint where he will meet Gobert. I want to stress the fact that this is not a pick and roll. It is simply an isolation with free passage to the paint. 


What effect is Gobert having on Harden in the paint? Let's look at the numbers. 


**Harden is shooting 12/27 (44.4%)  inside the paint. 17 (63%) of those shots have been floaters. His free throw rate is 0.160.In the regular season, Harden shot 53.9% inside the paint. 35% of those shots were floaters. His free throw rate was 0.449.**


Gobert is clearly having an effect on Harden's *scoring* inside the paint. All of his measures are down, and by a significant margin. In particular, he is being forced into a lot of flaoters and not getting to the free throw line. So how are the Jazz getting torched?


The other player that Gobert is semi responsible for is Clint Capela. The Jazz have been alternating between having Gobert attempt to guard Harden+Capela at the same time and sending help to guard Capela from the perimeter.


On the series, Capela is averaging 13.4 pts/36 on 62.8% TS. These numbers are good, and valuable for any team. On the season, Capela averaged 17.8 pts/36 on 65.8% TS. So while Capela is doing well this series, he's scoring less and on worse efficiency than the regular season.


The Jazz are doing relatively well at defending the paint. What else could it be?


1) Transition. 
**The Rockets haveaveraged 28 transition points on 19 possessions in this series. On the season, they averaged 19.5 points on 17 possessions a game. Perhaps more importantly, the Jazz only allowed 17.3 transition points on 14.9 possessions.**


There is a gap here in terms of transition defense. This is a result of UTA's inabilty to score against the switching defense. More misses and turnovers have led to more transition opportunities the other way. 


2) HOU's preparation. Much has been made about the MIL's success with this strategy. Many have pointed out the difference in personnel and shooting between the matchups. While I think that is a fair argument, I think what's being ignored is that Harden and the Rockets are now prepared for this strategy. A gimmick is a gimmick because it catches people off guard. When teams prepare for the gimmick, it is no longer. The Rockets are always in perfect alignment to make it difficult for the Jazz to help and recover.


3) Gordon + Tucker 3 point shooting. In order to shut down the paint, the Jazz have given up way more 3's than they have in their typical system. Gordon and Tucker are shooting 54.5% and 50.0% respectively from three. While Harden and Capela's efficiency in the paint has dropped, these two have ben ridiculously efficient.


The gimmick has been succssful in it's initial goal, forcing Harden into floaters inside the paint. However, Harden has lit up the Jazz with his passing. He makes the right decision every time and the shooters are making shots.


Additionally, the Jazz offense has been so horrible it has effected the defense by giving the Rockets the best tranition game in the playoffs. 


The Jazz - Rockets series is currently at 93.5 - 120.0 in offensive efficiency. During the regular season, it was 99.0 - 100.0 in favor of UTA. THe Jazz had the 3rd best defensive rating vs HOU and 3 of their 8 worst offensive performances. The lack of offense and gimmicky defense has given the Jazz no chance to compete this series.",nbadiscussion
1784,789,"Why is playoff basketball ""different""?","Aside from the fact that more rest neutralizes deeper line-ups, why is playoff basketball widely considered different than regular season basketball? Why do people say you need a super star who ""can create his own shot at the end of the game"" vs. just playing team basketball? Genuinely curious.

&#x200B;

Some possibilities below. Which ones are legit? 

* Coaches gameplan better, so your ""plays"" won't work, and things revert to hero/iso ball so you need great offense-creators.
* Players default to hero-ball for some reason in the playoffs and teams play a less team-oriented game
* Defenses are better so you cannot run as much, it's all about the half court, and good offense beats good defense. (is this true - why is ""half court offense"" considered more of a playoff situation than regular season)?
* Other???

1785,790,[OC] No Country For Old Spacing: Visualizing the Best Mid-range Shooters Since 14-15,"Hey fellas 

I wrote a quick script in Python to graph the highest volume mid-range shooters for the last 5 years, as well as for the current season thus far.

I made 2 styles of graphs. The first one is short mid-range FG% (4 to 14 feet) vs long mid-range FG% (14 feet to just before the 3 point line). In both graphs, the size of the circle is scaled by the number of attempts per game. 

I wasn't completely satisfied with this because 4-8 feet is hardly what comes to mind when you think midrange, so I made another graph that looks at percentage of long mid-range shots assisted vs long mid-range FG% (to give some extra context and to show some visual separation for guys like Al Horford and Kevin Durant.)

Take a look!

#[Here are the LMR Assisted% vs LMR% graphs for this year and for the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/a/tMznCla)

&nbsp;

#Things of note

* KD and CP3 live up to their reputations; both are by far the best mid-range shooters in the last 5 years, and KD is on a particularly impressive tear this year.

* The most impressive thing was how CP3 is assisted on almost none of his mid-range shots. The fact that he creates so much space is incredible.

* WB and Wiggins are the two worst mid-range shooters of the last 5 years. WB is largely unassisted on his, which certainly doesn't help his percentages.

* LeBron has been surprisingly poor at mid-range shooting over the last 5 years.

* Kyrie Irving is also pretty incredible at the LMR, on a similar level as Chris Paul.

* McCollum and Kemba are having very impressive seasons so far on LMR shots, largely unassisted.

1786,791,What problem are the new schedule format changes supposed to solve?,"In light of the recent changes that the NBA is considering to the season structure, I asked myself : What problem are they trying to solve?

If I understand things properly, the proposed changes are:

* An in-season tournament that decides...uh...who wins the in-season tournament 
* A playoff play-in tournament for the bottom seeds
* Reseeding playoff teams after the second round

There's a [good WaPo article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/11/23/nbas-proposed-schedule-playoff-format-changes-explained/) that lays it out really well. But, I'm not sure I buy all of the arguments.

It all feels like they are, at worst, solutions in search of a problem or, at best, designed to treat symptoms and not root causes.

The in-season tournament is the former. I have no idea what problem this solves and I can't imagine why any player or team would care, one way or another. I would much rather see a Big 3 style, 3-on-3 tournament during All-Star weekend. Or, even better, an NBA Jams/White Men Can't Jump 2-on-2 tournament.

The play-in and, to a lesser extent, reseeding, both skirt the real issues on how NBA teams acquire and retain talent. I don't pretend to know how to address either of those issues directly but I know that pretending that something else like seeding is the issue isn't going to help. 

What incentive does a 10th seed have to play-in to the playoffs? The owners may make a little more money on a couple home games during the first round but what else? Any lottery pick, even a mediocre one, is likely to be more valuable in the long run than an almost certain beat down that will come from facing the one seed. The flattening of lottery pick odds was a half-measure and did little to truly incentivize bubble teams to try and push into the playoffs or truly disincentive anti-competitive personnel moves (aka tanking). Sure, I suppose you could argue that going to the playoffs is the incentive in and of itself. I just don't buy that. But, I'm willing to hear this argument out. But, if you want more evenly distributed talent and fewer incentives to tank,first stop is fixing the lottery.

Further, if the NBA was really interested in giving lower seeds an incentive to get into the playoffs, one change they could make, or undo really, is go back to a best of 5 first round. That format facilitates a shorter but more exciting first round and opens the door for more upsets.  (PS: I HATE the 7 game first round. It's just too damned long and largely uninteresting, IMO)

The reseeding, again, appears to the point. If the argument is that the conferences are unbalanced, pretending that conferences don't exist isn't the answer. If the point is that we want to see the best teams play each other later in the playoffs, then, I guess this could work but that seems, again, a solution that nobody asked for. I get that reseeding might yield *different* matchups at *different*  times but I'm hard pressed to say that the new outcomes are objectively *better* than what we have. In fact, I could make the argument that we are better served by having the better teams in a stacked conference battle it out early, while they're still fresh rather than drag it out and risk injuries. 

Even if they took it one step further and just took the best 16, conferences be damned, it would still be suboptimal. And, if the recent popularization of load management is any indication, geography and the long flights that a more ""balanced"" schedule might create, isn't likely to yield more competitive play. 

I just don't think this is the move.",nbadiscussion

I can understand Harden and Davis withdrawing, but McCollum and Eric Gordon withdrawing? The latter two don't look like they're going to make the Olympic team. Or do they just not care about representing their country? Although don't get me wrong, Team USA is still stacked.

1791,796,Flopping Suspensions and Chris Paul,"Correct me if I'm wrong but when I googled flopping punishments currently in place in the NBA, it just says that players will be fined, and may be suspended but only after FIVE flops. I believe that should be changed, and that players should be punished more harshly after even just one flop, depending how egregious it is.

Two nights ago (Nov 18) when the Thunder played at LAC, with the scored tied 86-86 and under 40 seconds to go, Chris Paul dribbled the ball up and out of nowhere deliberately runs into Paul George's body and falls on the ground as if he was shot.  You can see in this video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-\_c6Akv4mLs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_c6Akv4mLs)) at the 10:20 mark. I would have uploaded the video itself but not sure if I can on this post.

Miraculously he was somehow awarded two free throws and made both, putting the Thunder up 88-86. As you can see in the video, PG-13 did absolutely nothing. The story of the night was PG's clutch 3 to win the game, but had he not made it, the Thunder probably would have won the game because of CP3's BS flop. How the refs awarded that as a foul on the Clippers is beyond me.

I think players around the league have gotten better in recent years with flopping. I remember at the beginning of the decade when even huge guys like Lebron and Blake Griffin would flop, but I find it ridiculous CP3 is still pulling this bullshit. I honestly think that punishment for flopping in situations like that should be an automatic suspension, beyond even just a simple fine.

Other players like Harden get called out for ""flopping"" but I think there's degrees to it. What Harden does is bait defenders to jump into his legs, or hit his arms WHILE HE IS SHOOTING, and all defenders know he does this. Harden never just deliberately runs and crashes into unsuspecting defenders while he isn't even attempting to score, like CP3 did on that play. CP3 has a history of this too, it wasn't even that single play ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvDUewrU9Yw&t=3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvDUewrU9Yw&t=3s)).

What do you all think? Is auto suspension too severe? I think what CP3 does represents everything the game shouldn't be, it's cheap, weak, and honestly clouds his whole legacy. I haven't seen anyone really discuss the end of that game, but am I making too big a deal out of that play?

Disclaimer: No, clearly I do not like Chris Paul as a basketball player, but hopefully that doesn't take away from the substance of what I had to say. I don't like Paul George either and was actually rooting for the Thunder to win that game, I just found the ""foul"" so egregious",nbadiscussion

1793,798,Does Portland even make a trade this year?,"Obviously Portland has a closing window with dame getting paid a ton well into his 30s. The consensus on r/nba was that they would make one or two trades (maybe involving whiteside) to improve their obvious weakness at the forward position. But with their lack of depth outside of guard spots and recent injuries will they just punt on this year?

Who knows how nurk and Collins will do when they come back and if anyone will give up something substantial for whiteside(if they want to move him). I know that doesn’t fit with what the players (especially dame) want but do they have much choice? The main trade pieces talked about are love or gallinari or maybe one of New York’s many wing players. But gallinari is expiring and very injury prone so I doubt they would be willing to give up much for him. Love is on a long expensive contract, is aging, and has also racked up a few injuries also. Maybe they like one of New York’s forwards but Gibson doesn’t offer much offensively. Would they make a risky trade for one of Morris, Portis, or randle? If they wait too long for the right trade they could lose their shot at contention.

1795,800,5 More Players Who Could Shock the World in 2019-2020,"**The NBA is improving in terms of overall depth of talent. Rapidly, like never seen before.**

The 2020's will be a Golden Age for the league. A near perfect combination of top level talent + ridiculous amounts of depth will please the casual and hardcore fan alike.

&#x200B;

***Last week we discussed 3 stud muffins on the rise: Tony Bradley, Wade Baldwin IV, Angel Delgado.***

These 5 players discussed are chilling in a higher tier. Whom we discussed last week, they have ridiculous potential that still needs to be realized and have the mindset to do so.

The professionals mentioned today have realized that potential a tiny bit more. I feel very strongly about the positive heights each of these players can triumph in 2019-2020.

Let's get right to it:

&#x200B;

**PJ Dozier (Boston Celtics)**

Let me be the first to say this:

*Do not be surprised if PJ Dozier is the starting point guard for the Boston Celtics next year.*

At the very, very least he should be in the rotation. With Kyrie leaving and I highly doubt the Celtics re-sign Terry Rozier, unless they sign Kemba Walker there is a wide open race for the starting point guard spot.

Dozier was more than impressive in the G-League this past season: 21 PPG, 7 APG, 7 RPG, solid perimeter defense, good AST/TO ratio (2/1), incredible size + athleticism + length for a player of his position at 6'6.

Here are some highlights of a 37 point/13 rebound/8 assist performance in the G-League back in December:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc2mO5uLXHQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc2mO5uLXHQ)

For a recently having just turned 22 year old at the time, the natural feel for the game is noticeable.

Another factor is the late great Reggie Lewis is his cousin, Dozier is hungry to prove himself in this organization.

The biggest area of improvement is his shot (31% from 3) his release is a little slow but the mechanics are there. He also put up a 12 point/11 rebound/5 assist game late in the NBA season vs. the Wizards.

*I want to emphasize the future can only tell if these players will reach their ceiling or not.*

**Ceiling: Top 50 overall NBA player, with a consistent jump shot + continued progression multiple time all star and can etch his name in Celtics' history.**

&#x200B;

**Lonnie Walker IV (San Antonio Spurs)**

The expectation from myself was for LWIV to be the rare rookie to crack the Spurs' rotation and make an immediate impact. If not for a torn meniscus in the preseason he would have.

Stats are good and tell a story (17 PPG in G-League, 44% FG, 36% 3 PT) but the bigger picture is seen by simply watching him play.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybKSWL2SNyc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybKSWL2SNyc)

Here was an opportunity he got late in the season where he put up 16 on the Nuggets. This video currently sits at about 85,000 views and the comments are in awe of his natural ability.

I didn't even look at the comments until right before I typed that and I was as well. The athleticism and IQ are there, personally the most impressive aspect was his uncanny mechanics for a freaking 20 year old. He looked like a veteran role player in that regard, and he's not even 21 yet.

LWIV is one of the more unique personalities in the league and has the right mindset as well:

*“In this family, we don’t fear failure. We have a win-win situation, no matter what it is."" (TheUndefeated)*

A prototypical Spurs' prospect that is further ahead in maturity and development than draft picks' of years past. As long as he's healthy, expect major progression in 2019-2020.

**Ceiling: Low end top 100 player, one of the more consistent + unique SG's of the 2020's.**

&#x200B;

**Theo Pinson (Brooklyn Nets)**

Pinson was one of the more intriguing prospects of the 2018 NBA draft. In basic terms, my evaluation was *""He's great at everything but shooting and that has a long way to go for him to make an impact"".*

Well, he made unprecedented progression with shooting and the other aspects of his game remained great.

I first was impressed with him in the NBA, but he destroyed the G-League this past season. Led the Nets to the G-League Finals and was Ridiculous Upside's G-League Rookie of the Year. Here are some highlights from a 43 point game he put up in January:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqN8L8U9YVU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqN8L8U9YVU)

His G-League season was eye opening: 20 PPG, 6 APG, 6 RPG. He showed potential role player abilities at North Carolina but he did not show this.

Here's what gets him on this list though:

*4 years at UNC: 26% 3 PT PCT*

*2018-2019: 39% 3 PT PCT*

His game was also noticeable in the NBA (where I first became impressed). Scored 19 points on the Knicks and Brooklyn converted his contract to guaranteed in April.

I would expect him getting consistent minutes in the rotation as the 9th man next year, looking at how Brooklyn used their SG's this past year I'd expect some starts as well.

**Ceiling: Top 120 overall, one of the best role players of the 2020's.**

&#x200B;

**Chris Boucher (Toronto Raptors)**

The story of this young man is absurd.

A dishwasher at 19 years old (never played basketball until he was 18) he was noticed and long story short he's progressed to the point where he was the 2018-2019 G-League MVP and DPOY.

27 PPG, 11 RPG, 4 BPG. Dude was pretty much the Anthony Davis of the minors.

He impressed at times in the big leagues as well. Here are highlights from the last game of the regular season where he put up 15 points/13 rebounds/2 blocks on the Timberwolves:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am1hRd2ux4Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am1hRd2ux4Q)

The block at the :35 second mark is one of the more ridiculous displays of athleticism and natural ability I've seen in the entire 2018-2019 season.

I'd be surprised if he didn't get a bigger opportunity in 2019-2020 (28 GP for Raptors in 18-19). There are some areas for improvement still as well: he still needs to put on 10-15 pounds. AST/TO ratio in NBA and G-League no bueno (2 TO to 1 AST)

He's overcame a lot of obstacles in his life, has continually progressed in his game in (really) the 7 years he's been playing basketball, and I'd expect him on the opening night roster next year.

**Ceiling: Top 140 overall**

&#x200B;

**Zhaire Smith (Philadelphia 76ers)**

One of my favorite prospects of the 2018 NBA Draft, I have been on record comparing him to Donovan Mitchell.

His impact in 2018-2019 would have been through the roof if healthy. Unfortunately one of the more bizarre incidents of the season set his progress back as an allergic reaction to a peanut had him hospitalized for 6 weeks with feeding tubes even longer and down to 160 pounds.

That's in the past, here's the deal now:

He's healthy, like fully healthy as far as we know. The fact that he came back from that (and a serious foot injury as well not to mention) even before the season was over is remarkable, arguably the most remarkable comeback considering he played great too.

The G-League was an adjustment, but he took off in the last regular season game in the NBA showing off a glimpse of the future.

Here was his 17 point/5 assist performance vs. the Chicago Bulls:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLnpMhbmfBg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLnpMhbmfBg)

The athleticism is evident with a play at 1:30. With ridiculous contact from Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, Smith attempts a layup that borderline defies the laws of nature. Although he misses the shot, he quickly gets to the basket for an offensive rebound and puts the ball in the basket.

The really great news: He will still be only 20 years old the whole season in 2019-2020 (turns 21 next June) the 76ers' are essentially getting a rookie.

His shooting form needs a little work (and is just a tiny bit too eerie to Markelle Fultz) but in 6 NBA games he shot 38% from 3 on nearly 3 3PA a game. I'm not concerned.

Smith is a long term project, but at the least should be in the rotation next year. If he can stay healthy and move in the right direction, I see a steady progression where he could be making a serious, serious name for himself by 2022-2023. Could be sooner.

**Ceiling: Top 60 overall, borderline all star.**",nbadiscussion
1796,801,NBA Draft prospects,"The ringer posted [their big board. ](https://nbadraft.theringer.com/?_ga=2.194907562.640027855.1587000960-321666247.1585415892)

Just curious about everyone's thoughts on this draft overall and individual prospects?

A couple of thoughts I've had.

1. Onyeka Okongwu looks like he could develop into the best player in the draft. Needs to develop a reliable jumper and have more discipline on defense though.

2. Nico Mannion is an intriguing prospect who projects at 25 here but earlier in the year I had seen him top 10 or even top 5 on some boards. The NCAA tournament would have been a good opportunity for him to put himself back in the lottery.

3. James Wiseman needs the right team to pick him. He is going to need time to develop but can immediately be used for his athleticism and rim protection. The Golden State Warriors would be a perfect fit for him I feel like.

4. Anthony Edwards is the prospect that I personally like the most but there are some concerns with his effort and jumpshot. His ability to get to the rim and finish in transition are at an NBA level and he has the body to match.

5. Tyrese Haliburton may be able to run an offense right away. He has a great feel for the game and could be a rookie of the year candidate. 

6. Deni Avdija is one player I really know nothing about and their doesn't seem to be any consensus about him. Really curious what you guys think of him. 

7. Tyrell Terry is very undersized at 6' 2"" 160 lb but he can shoot. He may be your next favorite player. 

8. Jaden McDaniels may be the prospect who's stock took the biggest hit this year after a disappointing season at Washington. Even then, just his ball handling and shooting at his size is enough to think he has enormous potential in the league. 

9. Tyler Bey is an undersized big man with a decent stroke who is projected late first round. His defense is his biggest strength and will be able to contribute right away. 

10. Killian Hayes who came in at number 1 in this big board surprised me also Wiseman being down at number 7.

This draft seems weak overall but still has a few potential stars. I know getting drafted into the right system and by the right team is a huge determining factor on whether or not a player succeeds in the league in every draft, but this year that factor seems more pronounced with these prospects. Looks like lots of role players who will need a team to find the right way to utilize their skills.

1797,802,Contested Threes vs Open Mid Range Shots stats for the 2019 playoffs,"Hi so I wanted to see how well the argument holds and see which ones were more efficient by how much.

 [So HERE are the stats for contested 3s (0-2 feet)](https://stats.nba.com/teams/shots-closest-defender/?Season=2018-19&SeasonType=Playoffs&sort=FG3A&dir=1)
Added them up and found that the playoff teams took a total of 9.1 threes from this range and made 2.4 of them. 2.4/9.1 gives us 26.37%, 

and then to get the 2 point value: 26.37*1.5 gives us 39.56%. 

[And HERE are the stats for contested 3s (2-4 feet)](https://stats.nba.com/teams/shots-closest-defender/?Season=2018-19&SeasonType=Playoffs&CloseDefDistRange=2-4%20Feet%20-%20Tight&sort=FG3A&dir=1) 
Added them up and found that the playoff teams took a total of 73 (exact!) threes from this range and made 21.5 of them. 21.5/73 gives us 29.45%, 

and then to get the 2 point value: 29.45*1.5 gives us 44.18%.

Added up together NBA playoff teams shot 23.9/82.1 which gives us a make percentage of 29.11%,

and then to get the 2 point value: 29.11*1.5 gives us 43.67%

**So 43.67% is the field goal percentage number a player needs to hit from mid range for it to be more efficient.**





Now onto the mid range stats:



[**I CANT FIND ANY STATS ON OPEN MID RANGE SHOTS BUT HERES THE OVERALL MID RANGE STATS**](https://stats.nba.com/teams/shooting/?Season=2018-19&SeasonType=Playoffs&DistanceRange=By%20Zone&sort=Mid-Range%20FGA&dir=1)

As we see from a glance , teams definitely don't shoot higher than 43.67% BUT that's without factoring in the contested shots which I would guess make about half of them.

1799,804,"If the Lakers fail to make the playoffs in 2019-20, LeBron probably asks for a trade doesn’t he?","That would be half of his signed contract where they did not make the postseason and LBJ might see it as a wasted opportunity to try to win. But I look at the mess of the Lakers organization and don’t see where improvement comes from. Vogel is probably a tad better than Luke, but it’s not like it is significant. Pelinka is running the operations and doesn’t have a lot of trust that Magic did in that role, free agents aren’t giving the Lakers the hot look anymore because of LeBron being there, and it’s even arguable that they could even make a trade for Anthony Davis anymore. It’s possible some other team (Boston, New York, Denver, Brooklyn) could make a trade and convince him to stay, it would be another Paul George situation. 

I look at the probable playoff contenders in the West next season- Golden State, Houston, Denver, Utah, Oklahoma City, Clippers, Portland, San Antonio and some outsiders like Sacramento, Minnesota, and Dallas, and I don’t know where the Lakers fit into that. The West has gotten better and the Lakers are behind.

1801,806,Should Portland blow it up? Lillard for Simmons+ filler?,"Two part question- a trade centered around Lillard and Simmons only makes any sense if fundamentally Portland decides to change directions and to retool/ rebuild. I realize there's little to no chance either team trades either player this season. What I'm saying is Portland SHOULD trade Dame, and Philly- maybe. So the first question:

1. Should Portland move on from Lillard? Leaving all emotions aside, I think yes they should shop Dame around RIGHT NOW when his value is at an all time high. Portland fans may hate management for doing so, but sometimes you have to trade your icon away (eg. Toronto trading Demar)

This is where people may disagree, but personally I see Portland going nowhere in the next few years. If they keep Dame and CJ they will continue to be good, but just middle of the pack, 2nd round at best like they have been the last 5 years (except for getting lucky last year). Anybody not from Portland should admit there's no way the Blazers were 2nd best in the west last year. The real WCF was GSW (with KD healthy for 5 games)  vs HOU in the 2nd round, Blazers got lucky with the seeding. IMO last year was their one shot, they dodged the #1 and #2 teams in the 2nd round, and still got swept by GSW without KD.

And then they let all Aminu, Harkless, Curry walk. Yes they've had some injuries this season but clearly the team is much worse than it was last year, practically losing all their wing defense. Many people on this thread speculate that maybe the Blazers could land Kevin Love or Aldridge, but IMO neither of those moves puts POR above LAL, LAC, HOU, and next year GSW with Steph, and Klay back.

Two years from now I think the convo will come up anyway about moving on from Dame and CJ, so better to trade one of them now rather than 2 years too late (eg. OKC with Russ, CLE letting King James walk without trading him in 2018). I made a post about this before but do people realize Dame will be making $49M a year? Idc how loyal and iconic he is in Portland, there are no basketball reasons that he should be making $9M more than Steph Curry. That contract (knock on wood) is one injury away from being an albatross- and at present I don't see how Portland improves their roster paying one guy that much.

2. What trade destination, if any, makes sense?

I say trading for Ben Simmons + picks and maybe other filler is a win win. Philly is in win now mode and Lillard would be a great fit. He's a lethal scorer from any distance, will give Tobias and J Rich more space, and lets Embiid play in the paint. Philly also has a great defense to cover for Dame. All quite self explanatory why Philly does this trade.

As for Portland, idk what the throw ins should be, but Simmons to me has a higher ceiling than what Lillard currently is. Lillard is undoubtedly a better player now but I think Simmons can be Giannis- lite. He needs a new environment where he's the number 1 option and somebody forcing him to work on his damn shot. Maybe I'm higher on Simmons than most but I think he could break out, like when Harden went to Houston, or Ingram going to NOP. Regardless, Simmons is much younger and would give Portland a longer window to surround him with pieces. They'll be worse in the short term, but like I said I don't think they would have contended the next few years anyway. Hell, they might not even make the playoffs this year.

&#x200B;

Even if you want to say I'm delusional and way too optimistic on Simmons, I still believe Portland should try something new. No offense to Dame and CJ but they are just the discount splash bros and won't lead Portland to a title (or even possibly another conference final). I really think they should pull a Toronto, fans will get over it in a few years.",nbadiscussion

Conley is a huge upgrade over Rubio. Bogdanovic is also a major addition, and an elite knock down shooter. I am also expecting Mitchell to make another leap, and solidify himself as a true superstar, and one of the elite offensive forces in the NBA. If Gobert, who is in his prime, has another DPOY type season the Jazz project to be a top 10 team both offensively and defensively. The Jazz have elite top end talent, a deep and well rounded roster, and an excellent head coach. 


Overrated: Atlanta Hawks

I see alot of people projecting the Hawks to make a jump from last season, and compete for the 8th seed in the East. I don't see that happening. They project to be a bottom five team defensively, and with no real back up PG, will struggle mightily on offense when Young is not on the floor. 

Though they won 29 games last year, thier -6 differential is in line with a 25 win team. I expect the Hawks to give their young guys tons of playing time, and struggle to match last year's win total.",nbadiscussion

1804,809,"If D'angelo Russell signs a max offer sheet, is it in the Nets best interest to match?","At this point it feels as if the Nets almost certainly would match any D-Lo offer sheet given how his breakout season has really galvanized the franchise, but if your singular goal was to build a championship contending roster, would retaining D-Lo on a max hinder that goal? 


Edit: for reference, Nets are able to offer him a full max of 5 years, $158.1 million, starting at $27.3 million next season.

A max offer sheet from another team would be 4 years, $117.2 million.

A simpler phrasing of the question: at roughly $30 mill/year over the next 4-5 years, would you consider D’Angelo to be a net positive, negative, or neutral trade asset?

Personally I’d be very surprised if he is not on the Nets next season, only way I see that being a possibility is if Kyrie decided to go to Brooklyn. In the wise words of Jalen Rose, “You don’t get paid what you’re worth, but what you have the leverage to negotiate for.” I’m curious to see how much leverage D’Angelo actually has, because I can’t really envision many teams aside from maybe the Suns offering him the max.

1806,811,Backpicks GOATs ranked by peak rather than career,"I thought this would be an interesting exercise, and I saw (as I came to the sub to post this) Ben Taylor and this list being mentioned in another thread about good analytical videos. 

I thought it'd be interesting to use his evaluations  - where he gives each player-season a % score based on how much more likely to win a championship that player-season would make an average/randomised team - to re-rank his list based on peaks and primes rather than total career value, which is how he ordered it.

&#x200B;

No surprises that Jordan wins pretty convincingly on the peak season, and (maybe surprisingly) even more convincingly on 3-year peaks and best 5 seasons (a lot of players had poor seasons in the middle of some greater ones so for the last category I thought it'd be interesting to not have to have all 5 seasons concurrent). 

&#x200B;

Predictably, Shaq moves up a spot on the list every time you restrict the length of time you're measuring, while LeBron suffers a little (still top 3 all-time peak in every category, mind), and Kareem suffers a lot (relative to his career goat status). Like the original career list, this one would argue that Garnett is slept on all-time, and when you shorten the time spans it would also argue that Robinson and West are as well. 

&#x200B;

Other surprises (for me) include Wade edging out Kobe for the last 1-season spot (Kobe and Nash were tied right beneath him on 18.5% for their peak seasons), and some of the gaps between players/'tiers' - largely moving one spot is a matter of 1% or a fraction of a %, but Jordan tops all three spans by an average of 3.7%(!), while there's another big 2% drop-off between Bron and Russel for #2->#3 on the 5-year average, and a similar drop-off from the top 3 peaks of Jordan/Bron/Shaq to Hakeem. 

&#x200B;

1807,812,Decade Defining Point Guards of the 2020s,"Who do you believe will be the point guards that define the next 10 years? This past decade was defined by Curry, Paul, Harden, Westbrook, Lillard  and Irving.

I am just considering a strong crop of 23 and under PGs currently in the NBA that I think are positioned to take over the 2020s. There will be a few more to join their ranks over the next three or four drafts, but I am not considering them for this post. 

One in particular stands out as clearly the best player to me. Luka Doncic. He is having an MVP type season this year. Currently has the Mavs 3rd in the West as their sole all star. Doncic is the driving force behind the top ranked offense in the NBA at age 20. The best 20 year old basketball player of all time. He is personally my pick to be the best player of the next decade. Doncic is almost 4.5 years younger than Giannis. I would take his skill and bball iq over Giannis's superior physical traits. Not that Giannis has low skill or bball iq, Doncic just might be the greatest basketball savant the league has ever seen. He is the Wayne Gretsky of the NBA. Able to see and anticipate at an all time level.

After Doncic, it is tough for me to choose among a talented quintet of young point guards. All of these guys project to be corner stone pieces of their franchises. I believe all will go to multiple all star games in the next decade, and have All NBA upside.

2. T. Young

3. J. Morant

4. B. Simmons

5. D. Fox

6. S. Gilgeous-Alexander

You can rank these next 5 guys in any order you want and I won't quibble. The other guys I would consider having a chance to be elite next decade are D. Russell, J. Murray, L. Ball. I think all three have all star upside, but I am not as bullish on them.

Do you guys agree that Doncic will be on a tier of his own over the next 10 years? Who do you think will be the second best? Any 23 and under PGs you think I have overlooked?",nbadiscussion
1808,813,The Clippers and the Curious Case of Patrick Patterson’s Minutes/Starting Role,"I know PatPat hasn’t had any where near as terrible a start as most of us feared coming into the season—in fact, he’s had flashes that make him look like a competent stretch 4 and intelligent defensive player (albeit limited by being a bit slow-footed/unathletic).

That being said, imo J. Green or M. Harkless would be the more obvious choice to start, especially next to Zubac who they’d be able to cover for (he’s slow-footed, similar to PatPat) better than PatPat with their length and on-ball pressure, possibly funneling players or bruisers into Zu so he can defend the rim without having to chase people around.

I’m interested in what you guys think about the possibility of PatPat getting these starter minutes in order to bolster his trade value and eventually make possible a package of him and another player(s) for a big who’s a good screener and at least just another big body to throw around out there to back up Zu (Baynes would be the obvious player coming to mind but i don’t want even want to think about how we could make that trade w out giving up a lot, but the player mold is what i’m referring to here).

This minutes strategy would be reminiscent of what we saw last year with Avery Bradley getting all of those minutes despite severely underperforming and often being used as the scapegoat (admittedly by us fans, but for good reason) for a lot of the Clippers’ losses during the first half of the season—although this could also be chalked up to stubbornness and dependence on veteran reputation and familiarity over performance on Doc’s part with his minute distribution, which is something we’ve often seen in the past.

***I obviously have no way of confidently proving that this is what’s going on other than what i’ve already stated, but I was interested in seeing what you guys might think about this as a possibility or something to keep an eye on in the future. Granted it’s still a small sample size and this could and almost certainly will change when Paul George comes back, but it’s nonetheless something I found interesting to consider.***",nbadiscussion
1809,814,Best and Worst Contracts in the NBA,"In honor of the trade deadline, let's look at the best and worst [NBA contracts](https://www.basketball-reference.com/contracts/players.html). To quantify player performance, we'll use ""[Win Shares](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html),"" which is a statistic that attempts to quantify total player performance, including shooting, passing, rebounding, and defense. It's not a perfect statistic, but it's a good estimate for player performance.

&nbsp;

[Let's take a look at Win Shares (through 2/7/19) vs. salary](https://i.imgur.com/e6tRVK3.png) (dot size here is proportional to minutes played). From the trend line, we can see that teams have paid an average of about $5 Million per win share at this point in the season. Above the line are players who are having standout performances, i.e. Harden, Giannis, PG. Below the line are players who are either performing poorly (Wiggins), missed significant time (LeBron), or both (CP3).

&nbsp;

[If we zoom in on the $0-10 Million range, we can see many young standout players who are outplaying their rookie contracts](https://i.imgur.com/SvPDoVl.png), e.g. Karl-Anthony Towns and Ben Simmons.

&nbsp;

Now let's define a stat that we'll call ""Expected Win Shares"" (xWS). This is the number of win shares a team expects a player to have if they follow the trend line. The difference between a player's Win Shares and their Expected Win Shares can then give us an idea of whether they are over- or underperforming their contract.

1812,817,What period of LeBron’s career is his “peak?” Has he even started to decline yet?,"LeBron has had one of the longest primes of all-time at this point. He’s been selected to the All-NBA first team every year since the 2007-08 season and has been considered by many to be the best player in the NBA throughout much of that period. LeBron’s longevity is almost unparalleled and he has managed to evolve and adapt his play style to his current circumstances many times. This led me to wonder, what is considered LeBron’s “peak?” At the age of 34, has he even started to decline yet? 

My initial reaction to this question is to say that his Heat days were his prime. He was at his athletic peak and was still a formidable defensive force, something that he has been criticized for recently. A lot of people forget that in his third season with Miami, LeBron shot 40% from three. Granted, this was on only a little over three attempts per game, which he shoots almost double of now, but his free throw percentages were also some of the highest of his career and noticeably better than they are now on similar volume. He also shot over 63% TS over the course of two different seasons in Miami, which is incredible for his volume.

However, there are definitely arguments that LeBron’s peak was in his second stint with Cleveland, notably the 2016 post-season. One of the biggest knocks on LeBron in his Miami days was his abysmal Finals performance against Dallas, which earned him the reputation of a “choker” for some time. LeBron’s iconic comeback against Golden State practically shattered these claims for good and solidified his place as one of the GOATs (or the GOAT, depending on who you ask). 

Some also argue that LeBron hasn’t even started to decline yet. It’s clear that he now coasts through the regular season and saves much of his energy for the playoffs. While his current season is probably his “least spectacular” one in recent memory, as he will possibly miss the All-NBA first team, this doesn’t necessarily mean that he can’t perform at an extremely high level when he needs to.

Ultimately, I think it will probably take a few more years to see a noticeable decline in LeBron. But even when that happens, there’s still arguments for multiple eras of his career being his peak, including his last years in his first stint with Cleveland which I didn’t really touch on.",nbadiscussion
1813,818,"""Raptors weren't actually a -9 defense"" is rubbish"," 

 The raptors posted the second greatest playoff defense ever, but this has been called misleading based on the bucks series being an outlier where they took them to -10, and the raps suppsoedly being able to do this against orlando, philly, or the warriors. Here's the thing, this take is treating philly's offense before the midseason trade as the same as their offense after their trade. Also, the orlando series number is just straight wrong. Here's how the raps actually fared vs their first three opponents, two of whom were top 5 offenses with the rosters they took into the playoffs:  


Magic had an offensive rating of 109 in the rs. Their rating vs the raptors, 95.1. That gives us  


\-14  


Philly post their trade had an offensive rating of 115.2. Their rating vs the raptors? 105. That gives us  


\-10  


Additionally they took the bucks down by 10 points.  


So, up until the final, facing two top 5 offenses, the raps d went  


\-14,-10, and -10.  


Not only s the raps -9 not overrating them, it potentially underrates them.  


The real outlier here?  


The warriors who without kd, without cousins, and a large portion of the series without klay posted an offensive rating of 110 with klay and 107 without. Their offense was reduced by 6 points from the rs, and 5 points relative to their performance vs the blazers.  


There have been many takes here about how a certain player's offense isn't resilient in the playoffs, or how two other players were ""exposed"", but the raptors were in truth a defense well above what we've seen from atg d's like the 08 celts and any takes based on performances against that kind of historic juggernaut should take that into consideration.",nbadiscussion
1814,819,The Most Underrated 5 Season Stretch in NBA History: A Case for Kobe Bryant,"Note: I know my account is called a burner, but this has been my only Reddit account for a few months now.

Kobe Bryant’s run from 2006 to 2010 gets hardly any recognition when discussing the best 5 season stretches in the history of the game. This run gets so little attention, in fact, that many people have even gone as far as to say that Kobe never came close to the dominance that is normally associated with a player of his caliber. Time and time again you will hear people say that Kobe didn’t peak as high as many other legends of the game. I find this claim to be ridiculous. 

I have put the following list together in order to demonstrate that Kobes best 5 year stretch is not only one of the most dominant in recent history, but that it can go toe to toe with just about any run in the history of the game. 

Awards / Accolades:


2 Championships

2 Finals MVPs

2008 MVP

2008 Olympic gold medal

5 all NBA first teams

5 all defensive first teams

5 all star selections

2 all star MVPs

2 scoring titles

Value:


Led the Lakers to the first seed in 3/5 seasons 

Led the Lakers to the finals 3 times in a row while playing at least 3 50 win teams throughout the playoffs in all 3 years

Eliminated 10 50 win teams from the playoffs from 2008-2010 (most ever over a 3 year stretch) 

Finished top 5 in MVP in all 5 seasons and top 3 in 4 of them

Led the nba in game winners over this stretch (regular season and total) (either first or second in playoffs) 

Led the NBA in 4th quarter points (playoffs) in 3/5 seasons and over the entire stretch

Led the NBA in total points and PPG over the final 5 minutes of the 4th quarter and OT over this stretch (playoffs) (led in 3/5 seasons as well) (shot 43% in fourth quarter and 44% in OT on mostly contested mid-range jumpers)

2nd in both 4th quarter points and PPG (regular season) over this stretch 

2nd in total points and PPG over the final 5 minutes of the 4th quarter and OT over this stretch (regular season) (shot 40% in the 4th quarter and 47% in OT on mostly contested mid-range jumpers)

Was the leader (Many players and coaches on the team has attested to this) of the “Redeem Team” and their closer when it mattered most. 
Scored 13 points in the 4th quarter of the gold medal game, including a late game 4 point play that helped seal the deal.


Scoring Dominance:


11756 regular season points (led league)

2358 playoff points (led league)

3 40 PPG months (no other player had even 1 during this stretch) 

Averaged 30 points per game in both the regular season and playoffs (led the league in both)

Averaged 29 points per game in the finals despite playing against the best defense in the league twice and a top 5 defense in the 3rd one. He led both teams in scoring in all 3. 

Shooting:


Shot 46% / 35% / 85% in the regular season while taking almost half his shots from mid range. 

Shot 47% / 35% / 84% in the playoffs while taking over half his shots from mid range. This is despite consistently facing off against the best defenses in the league throughout this era.

1816,821,Damian Lillard believes that Kevin Durant is another player that could put up Harden's numbers.,"Check out @BR_NBA’s Tweet: https://twitter.com/BR_NBA/status/1088672641672712192?s=09


Is Damian correct? Are there other players that could see this success with more volume? ",nbadiscussion
1817,822,"(OC) In the final three minutes of Finals game 1, LeBron scored 9 points on 4 drives to the basket, and created an open 3 that rimmed out on another. Here's why he didn't drive on the last possession of regulation","TLDR/Spoiler: it's not because he was afraid of the moment. Or, I mean, it could have also been that, but it was mostly because the Warriors rage quit trying to guard him normally and dared him to pass

On the five plays I giffed up, LeBron's strategy is pretty simple: get switched onto Curry, keep at least 2 defenders pinned to shooters in the corners, and clear out the elbow on one side of the floor. To illustrate how intent he was on creating this situation,  [here's the first 10 seconds of the final possession](https://media.giphy.com/media/35OOfK5I2NVPvRjQST/giphy.gif)

He runs roughly the same set each time to get to a similar spot, but exploits the Warriors reaction in a different way each time. [This drive](https://media.giphy.com/media/5SzxQIuJ9g4BKHja0E/giphy.gif) which produced a 3 point play with 50 seconds left is the cleanest outcome. He forces the switch, keeps Korver and Love as deep into the corner as possible, then clears out Looney by sending Green in motion.

LeBron knows that Looney has to follow because every potential rim protector is occupied with a shooter on the wing, and he knows that Durant has to switch because a) if JR is open for a second he'll hit him wide open for 3, and b) as I'll show in the next clip, if Steph wants to get back onto JR, he'll create a momentary window that perhaps only LeBron can exploit every time.

If you're watching that last play and scoffing at KD for giving up the switch so easily, [this play](https://media.giphy.com/media/pHYaCfc0dcVXeZS6Fp/giphy.gif) is what you're not seeing. This is what the fuck LeBron does to a defense when he's surrounded by shooters. Refuse to switch and he has already shot the gap. Over-commit to his drive and JR is wide open.

This can only really be stopped when Draymond can sag off his man, but there's nowhere to hide in these late game lineups. A few minutes after that last one, [LeBron did this](https://media.giphy.com/media/1oFZFgCUqi4MWyn2dT/giphy.gif) off an in-bounds play. Durant sees the guard coming up to set the screen again so he's thinking switch again, LeBron fakes hard in the direction of the pick, forces a massive overreaction, then has a clear path again.

[This is the 4th basket he scored on drives in the closing minutes](https://media.giphy.com/media/3znTAlOSQuz2CLBGfi/giphy.gif). I wanted to show this one last because it ties into the final possession most directly. Notice the motion of JR setting the sort-of-pick to force the switch, and George Hill half jogging/half drive blocking KD through the paint.

After forcing the switch once again, [this time Steph is guarding LeBron at the top of the key](https://media.giphy.com/media/8vt6Kq566LuoKtN8Ey/giphy.gif). Just like the Kevon Looney play, as well as the dunk over KD, LeBron sends the player on the right wing on a cut through the paint. It seems pretty apparent, in each case, that his focus isn't to find Hill open at the rim, but to clear out space. Like a QB sending a receiver in motion, he's keeping the defense honest and testing their scheme-likely expecting the same responses.

However, after getting torched by him over and over, and with the seconds dwindling down, GS clearly decided their strategy was to just force LeBron to do anything other than drive. Watch Draymond's eyes. He literally doesn't move a muscle when Hill moves past him. I don't know if he even saw him. Now there's 6 seconds left and he's effectively being triple teamed with two of the best defenders on either elbow. When he gets past Curry, KD and Dray will collapse in. If he tries to hit the side shuffle/stepback 3, either of the 2 longest wing defenders are in his face. Now there's 4 seconds and not a single defender is even looking at an 80% FT shooter as he strolls through the paint. LeBron passes, because he's fucking smart.",nbadiscussion
1818,823,What makes Miami so good at OT?,"So far they've gone 7-0 this season OT. (I think, going by memory). So is there something about the players and/or team construction that makes them particularly better than other teams at OT, or is it a statistically lucky streak of wins. 

My theory is 3 factors:

1. Team depth and health. A deep team is going to have more energy at the end of games.

2. Jimmy Butler. He has a reputation and personality for living for pressure moments. Some players are just made for big shots. Also team depth allows him to save his energy to close.

3. Luck. If a game goes to OT, it typically means that both teams were evenly matched, at least on that day. For a team to consistently take over evenly matched games 7 times there had to be at least some luck of making shots or luck of the opponent missing.

Thoughts?",nbadiscussion
1819,824,Scottie Pippen's one-year stint with the Houston Rockets,"Scottie Pippen began his NBA career with the Chicago Bulls in 1987-88 where he started out as a backup SF behind Brad Sellers but gradually took over his starting SF role after Sellers failed to win Michael Jordan over with his (Sellers') on-court play where he failed to average 10 or more points per game. And from there, Pippen went on to become a 7x NBA All-Star, 10x All-Defensive (8 with Chicago, one with Houston and one with Portland), 1994 NBA All-Star MVP, led the NBA in steals per game averages in '94-'95 with 2.9 steals per game, and went on to win all six NBA Championship rings alongside Michael Jordan.

However, by 1998, Pippen wanted out of Chicago after 11 seasons because he felt underpaid and Jerry Krause wouldn't pay him or renegotiate his contract, and so he became a free agent and with Jordan's second retirement and the Bulls rebuilding with Toni Kukoc as the main man, Pippen was signed-and-traded to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Roy Rogers (whom Houston acquired from the Toronto Raptors when the Rockets sent Kevin Willis to the Raptors in 1998 just before the lockout began).

With the Houston Rockets, Pippen (with a newly-signed five year $67.2M contract, and fresh off his back surgery after the 1998 NBA Finals vs. the Utah Jazz) played third banana next to Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley. The age difference between their starting backcourt and starting frontcourt felt night and day, as Cuttino Mobley and Michael Dickerson were rookies and starters at PG and SG, while Pippen, Barkley and Olajuwon were starters at SF, PF and C as expected. Even though Hakeem, Barkley and Pippen were an aging trio of stars, the Rockets were still expected to be back as NBA Championship contenders.

For the 98-99 regular season, Scottie Pippen (not really the same otherworldly two-way star after back surgery) averaged 14.5 points, 6.5 rebounds, 5.9 assists and 2.0 steals in 40 minutes per game as Houston didn't really have a suitable backup at SF to spell Pippen off the bench, as Eddie Johnson barely played, and Sam Mack turned out to be a flop in his second go-around with the Rockets just after he became known as a 3PT marksman with the Vancouver Grizzlies.

In the 1999 NBA Playoffs, the Houston Rockets took on the Los Angeles Lakers (led by Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and former Hornets superstar Glen Rice) where Pippen averaged 18.3 points, 11.8 rebounds, 5.5 assists, and 1.8 steals in 42-43 minutes per game as he scored an easy matchup against Rice, as Rice wasn't exactly known for defense. Pippen's most notable playoff game for the Rockets was Game 3 where Hakeem and Barkley were in foul trouble, so Pippen was allowed to score from the paint, which led to 37 points. But the Rockets still lost the series to the Lakers after a four-game sweep.

Overall, Pippen shot inefficiently when he made 5.8 field goals out of 17.5 (.331%), with 2.0 three-pointers made out of 5.5 (.363%), and got most of his points from the free throw line when he hit 5.3 out of 6.5 (.815%). And then Pippen and Barkley had their feud after the 1999 NBA Playoffs ended, and wanted out of Houston because he felt he wasn't being utilized correctly. He went from being the ""point forward"" for the Chicago Bulls to being miscast as a catch-and-shoot player (a la Robert Horry) in Houston, and so Pippen finally got what he wanted, as he went to the Portland Trail Blazers in a six-for-one deal as he was traded in exchange for Brian Shaw, Ed Gray, Stacey Augmon, Walt Williams, Carlos Rogers and Kelvin Cato. However, only Walt, C. Rogers and Cato played for Houston, while Shaw, Gray and Augmon never suited up for the Rockets as Shaw went to the Lakers, Ed Gray was out of the NBA afterwards and Augmon went back to the Blazers soon after, and Pippen became a veteran role player for the rest of his NBA career with Portland and a second but short stint with the Bulls.

What are your thoughts about Scottie Pippen's one-and-only season with the Rockets where he began his slow decline, him being reduced from MJ's sidekick to third banana next to Hakeem and Charles, and his 1999 playoff matchup against Glen Rice of the L.A. Lakers? Or even Pippen's first solo Sports Illustrated magazine cover away from Michael Jordan?",nbadiscussion

1821,826,[Noob Question] How do small market teams end up as contenders?,"If this is not okay, feel free to delete. 

I’ve always been a super casual NBA fan since I was young (Cleveland), with Lebron always in the mix everything usually felt hopeful. Now that he’s gone again it feels hopeless. The team is pretty bad, but even if they do end up getting lucky and hitting on a superstar in the draft it’s more then likely he won’t magically make them a contender. That one superstar will turn them into a borderline playoff team, but not talented enough to win a chip, and not being in the lottery to draft a player high. Being Cleveland, no big FA will want to come here leaving you in mediocrity until the superstar leaves and the whole problem starts over. 

Again, I’ve been a casual my whole life so sorry if this is a dumb question, this is just my perspective getting more into basketball.

1822,827,What are some tactical adjustments Nurse should make for Game 2?,"I liked the post about the Warriors adjustments, thought the discussion was great and wanted to start one for TOR.

What do you guys think the Raptors will do differently or adjust? Here's my two cents 

Defensively:

- Know your opponent:: TOR gave up several dunks and layups out of timeouts and set plays (at least 4 I think) ... And several more on backdoor cuts from over-pressing + late help on defense. Understanding when to press on D will be important, and being more familiar with GSWs playbook will help with that 

-Smarter fouls:: Let Steph beat you shooting contested 2pters or going to the basket... GSW made their run last game when TOR fouled away from the rim. Save those for hard fouls to prevent open dunks and layups.

As good as TORs defense was, I think they can be even better. ORebs were an issue in g1 but shouldn't be as much of an issue today, given GSW will probably focus a lot on getting back in transition 

Offensively:

-Get Kawhi/Kyle the ball in different spots:: The warriors weren't letting either of those guys get comfortable or initiate offense. Some solutions could be running Kawhi/Kyle PnRs... Or initiating the offense elsewhere and trying to let Kawhi catch the ball closer to the rim (facing up at the top of the key, baseline etc).

-Rely more on cuts than 3s: Warriors are blitzing and crowding the paint, and TOR settled for open 3s from players that may not be consistent over 7 games. A better option would be to attack the paint, as GSW has basically zero rim protection when they blitz, and Siakam has shown he can finish over the defense when it's not squared up/in scramble mode.",nbadiscussion

1825,830,Exploring Trades for Steven Adams,"Because OKC is moving towards rebuilding, they’ll probably move Steven Adams, and I’m going to outline a few trades for him. Let me know what you think, and if you have any other trades I’d like to see them. 

TRADE 1: BOSTON
BOSTON RECEIVES: Steven Adams, Andre Roberson
OKC RECEIVES: Gordon Hayward, 2020 BOS 1st round pick, 2022 BOS 2nd round pick
REASONING: Boston simply just needs a better defensive center than Enes Kanter (nothing against him, he just can’t play defense to save his life), and Adams is just that. His defensive prowess and rebounding will bring out the best in Tatum, Brown and Kemba. Roberson is pretty much just a salary filler, but can also help the bench as another wing piece (BONUS REASONING: STACHE BROS 2.0)

TRADE 2: 3 Team with San Antonio, Atlanta
OKC RECEIVES: Patty Mills, Alex Len, 2023 SA 2nd Rounder, 2020 ATL 2nd round pick swap option
SA RECEIVES: Steven Adams
ATL RECEIVES: Marco Bellinelli, Jakob Poeltl
REASONING: OKC can get out of Adams’s salary and gain draft capital, what’s not to like? San Antonio would net a top 12-ish center in the league, someone to complete their ‘Big 3’, and I personally believe that Adams would thrive under a coach like Pop. Atlanta ships out a center who they’re not really going to do anything with in Alex Len for Bellinelli, who’s essentially salary filler, but they also can take a shot on Poeltl, and as he’s young, can develop with Trae, Huerter and company. 

TRADE 3: Miami
OKC RECEIVES: James Johnson, Kelly Olynyk, 2021 MIA 1st round pick swap option, 2024 MIA 2nd round pick swap option
MIA RECEIVES: Steven Adams, Mike Muscala
REASONING: With Miami completing the deal for Jimmy Butler, if they are going to make any real noise in the East, they need an influx of talent that isn’t insanely expensive, such as Steven Adams. Mike Muscala is used as a dollar store-brand Olynyk to incentivize MIA to complete the deal. As for OKC, while they don’t really shed much salary, they gain capital with the option to swap picks with Miami, which can become very valuable.",nbadiscussion
1826,831,Am I crazy to think the Suns are going to make the playoffs this year?,"The Suns have been a very bad team for the last few years. They have also made some highly questionable decisions that leave them with a lineup that mot very many people are hyped on. 538 gives them a [12% chance to make the playoffs, based on player skill, and 2% based on Elo.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-nba-predictions/)

But looking at their roster construction, I think they have a great chance of making the playoffs. Rubio is a proven, veteran point guard who went to the post-season both of the last two years, averaging 15.4/3.2/8.6 in the series against the Rockets. He's not a great scorer, but he doesn't need to be with this team.

Booker is Booker. His 26.6/4.1/6.8 last season was overlooked, but if he makes another leap this year, his will be an all-star and potentially all-nba guard.


Oubre, he's struggled. Washington is not known for their stellar player development, and he was hot-and-cold in the Wizards uniform. But in 40 games as a Sun, he went 16.9/4.9/1.6 and he's only a year older than Booker. I think he can be a solid starter and a great third option on offense.

Saric is scrappy. His numbers are rarely great, but he knows how to fill in on both sides of the court, stretch the floor, and hustle. I've always been a fan of him

Ayton is the big wild card. He had a fantastic rookie season, averaging a double double, and looks to improve in the next few years. If he lives up to the hype of being the first pick in the draft, Ayton and Booker could be one of the most exciting duos in the league. And maybe with Rubio handling the ball, Ayton will actually get more touches in the post.

As far as backups, Tyler Johnson, 	Mikal Bridges, Frank Kaminsky and Aron Baynes are all fine in limited minutes. And I'm expecting one of the young core: Bridges, Cameron Johnson (11th pick) or Ty Jerome (24th pick) to step up this year. If one of those young guns does become a dangerous 6th man off the bench, I think the Suns are in a good position to make the playoffs. Compared to 538's prediction, I would I would put the Suns in over the Timberwolves. 

Am I cray? Do you think that the Suns chances of making the playoffs are closer to 50% than 2%? Or is Booker just a stat-padder who will never win a playoff series until he gets traded to the Cavs when LeBron re-returns in 2022?",nbadiscussion

Well here it is, the best team I could construct from the #12 picks in the lotto era. Take it in, this is what mediocrity can get you in the draft. Mookie Blaylock is far and away the best player on the team, and a pretty underappreciated guard. He made 6 consecutive All-Defensive teams (2 1st and 4 seconds) and if it wasn't for two of the greatest defensive guards ever (Jordan and Gary Payton) he would have been 1st team each time. He has a good distributor and a pretty good shooter, it's a shame that he's stuck on this awful team. 

Steven Adams was another easy addition, he also brings in solid defense and rebounding, a PnR with Blaylock and Adams would be pretty good. Lamb, Young, and Saric round out the rest of the starting lineup. Thad could be the slotted at the PF position, but I like Saric and Young playing off of each other. Lamb had a pretty good year last season, I feel like he'll come into form as a pretty good wing in the future and honestly, it's not like there is anyone better. 


A few thoughts when constructing the roster

****
* Muggsy Bogues is always a fun player to have on a team, him and Greg Anthony are ok backup guards. I wish I could say that I had more choices, but my hands were pretty much tied. The guards I left off consisted of:

      * Luke Kennard

      * Khalid Reeves

      * Alec Burks

      * Gerald Henderson Jr

      * Miles Bridges

      * Xavier Henry

      * Harold Miner


I can see Kennard and Bridges being on this team in the future, I like both of them quite a bit, but it's probably a bit too soon for them. Gerald Henderson Jr. had a couple of pretty good years on Charlotte, but he's okay I guess. Taurean Prince is another young player who I think will continue to improve so he made the cut as the wing off the bench.
 

* [John ""Hot Plate"" Williams](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/17/sports/pro-basketball-keeping-score-one-pound-at-a-time.html) was a pretty talented big, had a soft touch around the rim, could pass the ball, fairly good FT shooter, but he ate himself out of the league. He is a pretty tragic figure actually who just couldn't put it all together. Collison is the perfect role player off the bench, is able to to do a bit of everything and is a great teammate. Grant and Radmanovic are unremarkable, but fine players. 



****

This team is easily the worst team in the field and would be one of the worst teams in the league. Moookie Blaylock was a good player who could really help a good team, but everyone else is essentially just a role player.

1828,833,Do you think the NBA is too lax with what counts as an assist?,"Like watching euro ball they are far more strict as to what counts as an assist. (Direct jumpers or layups) 

For example,[ I don't think plays like this should count as an assist](https://streamable.com/00xnd). This jumper by Tatum is entirely self-created but Kyrie gets credited with an assist just because he shot it relatively quickly.

I do think passes leading a teammate to the line should count as an assist, but not sure what the parameters would be (only if you make all your FTs?)


What do you guys think of this?",nbadiscussion
1829,834,Building your bench,"I think a lot about team building/roster construction in general with the NBA, I follow the draft super closely and I'm always thinking about the different approaches teams take, and I've read/heard a lot about the thought process behind constructing certain teams, so I understand a lot of the directions that teams can take in building a roster as a whole

But if you hone into building a bench unit specifically, what is the best approach to it? I don't actually know if any of this matters, maybe teams just see a positional gap and try to fill it with the best possible player they can, but I'm wondering if it goes any deeper than that?

I think Bench Units are going to become even more important because the ideal roster construction seems to be shifting to valuing depth again over star power. Basically I think a Superstar, complimentary star, and depth are better than Big 3s with maxed out star power regardless of fit and lack of depth

Just brainstorming, I've thought of 3 different approaches teams can take to filling out their bench, so I'm wondering what you guys think would be the best of these, or if the best path is a mix of them, or if there's another path i'm not thinking of 

The 3 approaches I've come up with (the three Ps to make it catchier) are Parity, Puzzle Pieces, and Platoon

**Parity =** Is the best way to fill out your bench just to bring in replacement level versions of your starters, guys who can do a lot of the same things just at a lower level? 

Think if the Pelicans got Eric Paschall to fill in for Zion. He's kind of like a more regular human version of Zion who can do some of the same stuff and fill the same role, but at a lower level. Another example would be if the Rockets brought in Derrick Rose to be Westbrook's backup off the bench, considering he brings basically the same skillset to the table but just at a lower level? Does that add a beneficial element to a bench unit?

I thought about this approach specifically because of a prospect in this upcoming draft named Kira Lewis. He's a very similar player to Deaaron Fox and brings a lot of the same things to the table, but he's not really being a discussed as a potential franchise player like Fox was out of Kentucky. I'm wondering in the eyes of Sacramento decision makers, would he be more attractive to have on the team or less attractive? Does it help more to have a guy who can be like 70% of your starter and you can swap them out more seamlessly, or does it limit roster versatility if the starter and backup have the same skillset? Kira Lewis is crazy fast but not the greatest shooter, so does it help the Kings bench to have that constant pressure at the rim the entire game, or would it hurt them vs teams that can better neutralize Fox and guys like him?

Basically, would it be good to have your bench unit just be a B-, C+ version of your starting lineup?

**Puzzle Pieces =** Is the best way to fill out bench to get interchangeable pieces offer different things and that can be mixed and matched within your starting line up? 

An example of this would be Marcus Smart, hes not a full on bench player and plays starter minutes so maybe a little different, but he offers a completely different skillset than Kemba Walker while also being able to run an offense. So if the Celtics need to focus on getting stops they can sub out Walker for Smart. But Smart can also play alongside Kemba if needed

Another would be Livingston on the Warriors teams. He brought a completely different skillset than Steph, he was huge for a PG and held up better defensively, he was post scorer, and he could still play alongside steph and had versatility to play 1-3 situationally 

Another example would be San Antonio with their guards. It seems they started Derozan and Forbes primarily, with Murray, White, and Mills off the bench. Forbes, Mills, and Derozan are all more offensive players, Forbes and Patty bring similar skillsets as a good floor spacers, and Derozan is pretty much the opposite of that. White and Murray are really great defensive players. Idk how often the Spurs actually do mix match combos, I don't watch enough of them, but having all these guys gives them combos for different situations. If they need stops, roll with White+Murray. If they're down big and need a hail mary, throw Patty and Forbes. If Derozan's hot but has a bad defensive matchup, play one of the defensive guys with him to take it off his hands. Point is it gives them a lot of versatility and they can play a lot of different ways

Does this versatility make it the way to go? 

**Platoon =** Is the best way to fill our your bench unit to have a complete, cohesive that play well together, separate from your starters?

Think the Clippers. The starting lineup runs through through two star wings and they let Kawhi do a lot in isolation and midrange, and then they have a cohesive bench unit that comes in and it's almost like facing a different team. They run a lot of PnR with Lou and Montrezl and have Shamet and other interchangeable wings, so for other teams its almost as if you're facing two different offenses. Obviously this Clippers bench is a little bit of an exception because they may have the most talent in the league and their players can function as puzzle pieces too, but I think you get what I mean by a platoon system. 

The Raptors teams of the past few years have been similar, the Dallas bench this year was similar too. They go from a heliocentric offense running everything through Luka to a 3-ballhandler lineup. They were super successful as a bench unit this year too so is this the way to go?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR: Is it better to have a bench unit full of players that fills in for your starters, compliments them, or fit with each other as a separate unit

Let me know what you guys think, and if anyone has any insight into what kind of benches have been the most successful historically in the NBA, id be really interested in hearing about it",nbadiscussion
1830,835,"History of the NBA, Part 1","With regular season NBA games starting soon, I wanted to provide a summary of the important points of NBA history so new fans could get acquainted with the story of the league. I also included some really interesting trivia facts I found while researching some info for this to keep more experienced fans interested.

Here is a link to the document on Google Drive. So far, I have only finished Part 1 (Origin, Birth of the NBA, and the Russell/Wilt/West era). Will update when I finish each section.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fiB4DSb6r0XIbKKqqBLVLeeuq1hs4HrEL-MWOyhRd7w/edit

Both to bypass the AutoMod character requirement and to give you all a preview, I have included a truncated version in the text here. 

&nbsp;

Here is a brief history that gives the bare essentials of the history of the NBA. If you want a more comprehensive one I recommend Basketball: A Love Story, either the documentary by Dan Klores or the book by the legend Jackie MacMullan and Rafe Bartholomew. [Here](https://www.theringer.com/the-bill-simmons-podcast/2019/7/25/20726685/nba-summer-mailbag-plus-kevin-costner-on-his-best-baseball-movies) is also a link to an 8 minute segment (25:00 - 33:15) on a Bill Simmons podcast episode in which he breaks down the major eras of the NBA. This post derives  the categorization of the eras from that segment, expands on each era Bill describes, and adds some tidbits that I felt were important. I touch a lot on issues of race in the NBA, especially in the early sections, because I believe it is one of the biggest influences on the development of the league.

&nbsp;

Many people say that the first dynasty of the NBA was Russell’s Celtics, but in my opinion, the story of the NBA begins with the Minneapolis Lakers (now known as the Los Angeles Lakers). Led by the bespectacled George Mikan, the Lakers won 5 championships in 7 years. During this era, the vast majority of players were white – in fact, there was a de facto ban on black players back then. Interesting trivia fact: the first non-white player to play in the NBA was actually Japanese-American Wataru ""Wat"" Misaka, who scored 7 career points. Since today’s NBA is a predominantly black league, it is important to note that Nat “Sweetwater” Clifton, Chuck Cooper, and Earl Lloyd became the first three black players in the NBA in 1950. 

&nbsp;

The lifting of the de facto ban on black players in the NBA caused a major influx of talented players in the 1950s and 1960s, chief among them Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain. The contrast between their respective careers, accolades, and legacies would spark two timeless debate topics among NBA fans: the importance of individual vs. team success when evaluating a player, and of course, the title of Greatest Of All Time (GOAT). Jerry West introduced a third timeless NBA theme – the tragic hero that had the misfortune of being born at the time of another, greater dynasty. Together, the three would establish the NBA’s status as one of the four major team sports in America.",nbadiscussion
1831,836,How would Brad Stevens adjust team defense to Celtics downgrade in front court rotation,"Obviously replacing the front court rotation of Horford Baynes Morris with Enes Kanter Daniel Theis and Vincent Porter? Or Robert Williams? (Or Tacko Fall?)  is less than ideal. 

But what even more fun is that the East is quite stacked at front court: 
Bucks have Giannis and Brook Lopez,
76ers have Horford and Embiid, 
Pistons have Blake and Drummond,
Pacers have Sabonis and Myles,
Raptors have Siakam and Gasol.


The 2 best defenders on Celtics are Marcus Smart and Jaylen Brown, both versatile but mostly perimeter oriented guys. Stevens most likely going to trot out the closing line up featuring 5 out his 6 best players that are Kemba, Smart, Brown, Tatum, Hayward and Kanter. Also another weird dynamic depends on match ups, which one of Kanter Hayward Brown and Smart could be benched. But in any case,any combo of that closing line up is less than ideal when you have to defend the front court giants of the East. Sure the small ball line up of Kemba Smart Brown Hayward Tatum could do some damage on offense but can they defend and rebound enough for it? Idk.

While Brad Stevens had some success hiding Isaiah Thomas next to undersized Avery Bradley and Jae Crowder on perimeter defense. It’s going to be hard for him to hide Enes Kanter and the rest of his front court against guys against the more skilled, more physically imposing Front courts of the East. How would he adapt to this? Should we expect Celtics to play more zone defense more often next season?",nbadiscussion

1833,838,"[OC] What is a lottery pick worth? The average value of every lottery pick, by draft position","Hey there NBA fans, with the playoffs beginning today, approximately half of all fans are looking forward to the draft. To put into perspective what's at stake during the draft lottery, I decided to show you all what you can expect out of each pick in the draft. 

**Methodology:** I simply took the last 21 draft classes, from 1998 forward, and looked at the win shares provided by each pick, as well as their summary statistics. I got the idea from [Aaron Barzilai](https://www.82games.com/barzilai1.htm), who did something similar, but his data is a good bit older and thus I felt it could benefit from updating.

Quick note about Win Shares: I took my data from basketball reference and their definition of [Win Shares](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html). No advanced stat is perfect on its own, but this is better than most.

1834,839,A few lesser-known websites for basketball statistics,"Everyone who has gone into basketball statistics ends up on stats.nba.com or bbref. Both of these are neat but I’ll provide a few lesser-known pages full of good information.

[PBP Stats](https://www.pbpstats.com) provides play by play data. My favorite part of this website is the lineup tool to see which lineups in the league have the greatest plus/minus.

[NBA WOWY](https://www.addmorefunds.com/nba-wowy/) is used for DFS like FanDuel or DK. They have a free Slack group and all the information is free. It’s neat and “WOWY,” or “with or without you” is similar to the PBP stats website above. There is a lot of overlap in data.

[Crafted NBA](http://craftednba.com/player-cats) is a new website that combines many popular advanced statistics and curates rankings based off of them. It creates player categories such as “Shoot the 3, Play the D” that creates a ranking of the best 3&D players, Covington currently being on top. They provide a lot of face value statistics that are easy on the eyes/brain, so if you don’t care for the methodology, this may be for you.

[250/500 Day Trailing RAPM](http://canzhiye.com/rapm/) is available on this website. This is unique because there are very few publicly available RAPM values. While there is no historical RAPM beyond 500 days, this is still a valuable resource. To clarify, 500 days does not include the off-season, it’s 500 days of basketball.

[RAPM From 1997](https://basketball-analytics.gitlab.io/rapm-data/) is available here. While the values provided here have been found to be off of the sample used to calculate RPM, they are virtually identical. The full code is available here as well if you’d like to calculate RAPM yourself.

[BBall Index](https://www.bball-index.com/#) is home to Goldstein’s PIPM and another statistic called POE.

 Basically build a 12 man NBA roster using the prices listed in the excel sheet. You will want the first tab in it NBA Salary Draft Prices in this, the other one is something separate NFL related. 

Rules are in the sheet but to list them here for convenience 

1) You are building for a 5 year window. The next 5 years and nothing else. 

2) The Salary Cap is $120. Work around that. 

3) 12 man roster. Look if you are getting tired by the end and just want to say ""Any 3 $1 players"" or ""Any 2 $2 players and 1 $1 player"" instead of spending time finding a specific one for the end of the bench that's fine. Just factor that into your budget calculation. 

4) This is not a 2K franchise unfortunately, no settings to turn injuries off so factor in durability/injury track record accordingly. 

5) There are 320 players in there but inevitably I know I didnt get to all of them. If there's someone you particularly want but the price isnt listed, you can DM me/respond to this asking for a price Ill make one and include it in there. Sorry but no rookies from this upcoming class or international players 

6) For prices it was basically me weighing both my own thoughts on players and the general consensus on them. There are absolutely players in there I wouldnt touch with a 10 foot pole I think their price is too high but I tried to factor general opinion on players. At the end of the day though there will still definitely be my general biases/takes on players that creep into the pricings(cough cough Marcus Smart) 

Ive come up with a roster or two so far, I can post it later. Throwing it out here though to see what people come up with. Feel free to discuss anything, complaining about player prices, thoughts on roster building, guys you think are priced too low etc dont care fire away. 

In particular I found the following some of the hardest players to rank interested to hear thoughts: Joel Embiid, Kevin Durant, Zion Williamson, Jamal Murray, Tyler Herro, Michael Porter Jr, Zach LaVine, Colin Sexton, Victor Oladipo, Chris Paul, Jonathan Isaac, Draymond Green, Christian Wood, John Wall, Marvin Bagley, RJ Barrett,",nbadiscussion

What were people saying about them? How high were they expected to be drafted? How did people think they would do in the NBA? 

I'm starting with the 2018 draft trio of Trae, Luka and Deandre. The Luka Doncic and Deandre Ayton editions are nearly complete so I'm posting the Trae Young thread now while I finish the other two. The Luka and Ayton threads should be posted soon.

Summary - It seems Trae was famous in state but kind of unknown on the national stage relative to other top prospects. There was some debate about where he'd fall in the lottery but his crazy start at Oklahoma got him a lot of attention. Most doubted Trae because of his size but a lot of people recognized that he was an offensive force who might just play himself into a spot as a top 5 draft pick.

>This year, I just think the top 5 is too stacked for him to get into that conversation unless he plays at the level we've seen him play in games, and does it for the rest of the season and makes some noise in their conference tournament and in the NCAA tournament. But as of right now, Ayton, Bagley, Doncic, Porter, and Bamba are all clearly the top 5 prospects barring any injuries happening or just an absolute collapse by any of them. There's been so much hype around those 5 that they're seen basically on another level than any other prospect atm.

>Plus if you read into his scouting reports a bit and what scouts/coaches had to say about him as a player, it sounds like he needs the ball in his hands and basically has to be the focal point of the offense for him to be effective. Apparently a reason a lot of coaches backed off of him in recruiting down the stretch was cause they were worried that he wouldn't play well with other players of his equal talent level cause the way he plays currently, requires him to be a black hole on offense (of course, I say this the night he gets 22 assists).

> I feel like the Curry comparisons aren't really justified... if you watch Trae play, he seems to lack the quickness and skill at finishing around the rim that Steph had, even in college. Steph's 3-point shooting is so godlike that whenever a college player shoots lights out from deep they get compared to Curry, but Steph's ability to get to the basket is also elite and Trae doesn't have that at all.

1837,842,About John Wall and the role of management,"Disclaimer: Title should include Bradley Beal!!

I watch Washington a lot and observe Portland. There's definitely differences between Wall/Beal and Dame/CJ, but it's safe to say that their backcourts are the main investment. 

At the same time management and roster construction for the teams are much different. While both front offices overpaid guys in the summer of 2016, the money was spent in different ways.

Portland paid $10M to Meyers Leonard, $17M to Evan Turner, $19M to Allen Crabbe, $9M to Moe Harkless, and $8M to Festus Ezeli(all per year salaries, rounded up). Washington $16M to Ian Mahinmi,$5M to Jason Smith, $7M to Andrew Nicholson and traded a second round pick for Trey  Burke.

Both teams shelled out money, but Portland paid their young guys (Meyers Leonard turned down more money) in the hope that at least one would cash in and develop into a rotation player on a winning team. Evan Turner got starter money because he was starter caliber, if not full time starter. Crabbe wasn't great, but had decent value because he was still young (this was before CJ signed for his new deal).

Washington spent money on seasoned veterans, two of which were Centers. Mahinmi was recovering from injury most of the season (he played 14 minutes in a game before February). Nicholson was not able to earn minutes and was already a few years in the league (he was 27 at the time, with 4 years of experience), so they traded him and a first round pick to Brooklyn, for Bojan Bogdanovic. Bogdanovic was effective as an offensive weapon, but it cost Washington a first round pick. Brooklyn used it to select Jarrett Allen, a young C that suited Washington. Trey Burke was on the last year of his rookie deal and didn't play much, wasting Washington's second round pick (it wasn't Trey Burke's fault).

During the 2017 offseason, Portland traded Allen Crabbe for Andrew Nicholson, but then stretched his contract. They also drafted Zach Collins and Caleb Swanigan, and inked in a new deal for CJ.

Washington supermaxed Wall (at the time he earned), but that wasn't going to kick in for a couple more seasons. Washington chose Otto Porter over Bojan Bogdanovic. Brooklyn offered Porter a max (I thought it was a brilliant move on their part, knowing Washington's situation), but Washington matched because they needed Otto. They had to sit on their hands through the next draft, leaving the team with very little youth to develop. They also signed Mike Scott and Jodie Meeks to minimum deals (Meeks had a second year player option).

The next season rolled around. Portland fared better, while Washington snuck into the playoffs as an 8 seed. Both teams were eliminated in the first round. 

Last summer, Portland had room to re-sign Jusef Nurkic to a team friendly deal at $11M, and Nik Stauskus for a minimum deal. They drafted guard, Anfernee Simmons as well.

Washington reloaded with minimum contracts to Dwight Howard and Jeff Green. Jodie Meeks opted in as well (but was suspended due to a rule violation). They traded Marcin Gortat to the Clippers, for Austin Rivers. Rivers was on the last year of his deal and due $12M. Washington also picked up Thomas Bryant, still on his rookie deal and drafted guard, Troy Brown. That set up Washington to start the season with *8* guys on expiring contracts (Markieff Morris, Kelly Oubre, Tomas Satoransky, Austin Rivers, Jeff Green, Thomas Bryant, Jason Smith and Jodie Meeks. 9, if you count Dwight's second year player option). 

Portland left themselves with room to continue building, as they traded Stauskus, Wade Baldwin and a pick for Rodney Hood, and Caleb Swanigan for Skal Labisserie. Washington had to a few deals after a poor start to the season such as:

- Jodie Meeks to Milwaukee, for a pick
- Jason Smith and the recently acquired pick to Milwaukee for Sam Dekker (part of a three team deal)
-Kelly Oubre and Austin Rivers to Phoenix, for Trevor Ariza
-Markieff Morris and a second round pick to the Pelicans, for Wesley Johnson 

Washington thought adding veteran defensive players would fix the defense. That didnt happen and Wall went out for injury/surgery. After announcing they would keep Otto Porter, Washington traded him before the deadline to Chicago, for Jabari Parker, Bobby Portis and a pick. Once again they were left with over 5 guys on expiring contracts, but they really shuffled the deck chairs and lost their youth.

So, what's the point?

Many times I read posts and articles, or watch videos about how much blame should be lumped onto Wall and how much praise placed onto Lillard. 

Lillard is a great leader. On court he fits in to the direction the NBA is heading with more perimeter shooting. Not to mention he's improved every year. 

Wall isn't a bad leader. The feud with Gortat went both ways. Gortat created opportunities for others with his screen setting, but Wall assisted him for a majority of his scoring. Wall and Beal said that they don't **always** see eye to eye, but  it wasn't signs of trouble between them.

Overall, I think Portland created a solid environment for Lillard to thrive, and made wise personnel decisions. A majority of moves they've made, and continue to make, build the team. 

Washington, on the other hand, kept making decisions to cancel out the good ones. It caught up with them big team leading to a huge blowout at practice last fall. It became easier to see Wall's flaws (playing through injury or not) when so much more is going wrong. Admittedly, his play since signing the supermax hasn't been great, but the lack of depth shows how much they rely on him. There were moments of the team playing better without Wall, but it didn't last long. 

Washington's front office seems to get it so far. We'll see if it continues. And, Wall absolutely needs to cut back on forcing bad shots. He's got Beal and Thomas Bryant, who can initiate offense. Troy Brown and Rui Hachimura too. 

TL; DR - front office decisions can effect player legacy. Hoping Washington keeps building correctly so Wall and Beal, as well as Dame and CJ can lead their teams far. They've been two of my favorite duos to watch.",nbadiscussion
1838,843,With the Blazers current roster are their any adjustments they could make or ways Dame could improve his game in order to deal with the constant double teams that have been so effective against them in the playoffs?,"Dame’s getting a ton of criticism for his play in the last two series and for the series again New Orleans last year. I know I’m incredibly biased but I think a lot of that criticism is incredibly unfair.

The personnel outside of CJ is completely inept at having the skills necessary to deal with the trap on the PnR. I feel like every PG in the league would struggle to a certain extent being put in Dame’s situation.  While Steph is clearly the better player a large part of his success this series is the fact that the Warriors have the perfect personnel to deal with any sort of trapping defense (and the Blazers defense is non existent compared to the Dubs). 

I haven’t seen any suggestion as to what Dame could be doing in order to deal with the Golden States defense. Like what particular skill set does Dame lack that would make him better at dealing with that sort of defense? Also are their any adjustments that Stotts could make in order to counteract that trapping defense with this roster or are the Blazers doomed and perfectly set up to make Dame look bad against the trap?",nbadiscussion
1839,844,"Should the Clippers fail to come out of the West this season, how much pressure are they under?","They’ve struggled with Dallas and now are at a Game 7 with the Nuggets in the semifinals. There’s a good chance Clippers don’t make it out of the West, or even the second round at this point. For a team that came into the season with a championship or bust hype and instant favorite expectations, they’ve been letting down in the playoffs. 

How much pressure does the organization have should they not make the Finals or even the conference finals this year? Kawhi and PG both can be free agents next summer, there’s not a whole lot of guys with trade value on the roster, teams like Golden State and Portland will be healthier next season, and the team isn’t real set with a future; it’s more of a present-day win now construction. What would the Clips offseason look like if they fell short? Do you think they’d look to get rid of George after one season? What would they do with the role guys? Would they get a new coach? 

They’re a bad Game 7 away from going home to Denver and they would be mocked the whole offseason. Even losing to the Lakers would bust up their expectations I would think, since their championship window is running short. How much pressure do you think they’re under if they fall short of the NBA finals?",nbadiscussion
1840,845,"Best single-game performances in the modern NBA (post-1978) using ""game-score""","Game score: statistic was invented by John Hollinger to provide a rough measure of a player's performance in a given game. The formula is as follows:
(Points x 1.0) + (FGM x 0.4) + (FGA x -0.7) + ((FTA-FTM) x -0.4) + (OREB x 0.7) + (DREB x 0.3) + (STL x 1.0) + (AST x 0.7) + (BLK x 0.7) + (PF x -0.4) + (TO x -1.0). 

[This video](https://youtu.be/nn55LA2loiU) analyzes the top 10 and top 100 single-game performances after 1978 based on game score. The video does a good job of trying to be objective and was a good watch. 

What do you think? Is the statistic flawed to rank games? The video talks about how this stat ignores ""clutch"" games and so do you think there are some more clutch games that deserve to be higher on the list? The most interesting thing to me was that between 1995-2014 (20 years) 32 top-100 performances, while between 2014-2019 (5 years) it produced 24 top-100 performances.

1841,846,30 NBA All-Time Teams in 30 Days: All-Time Milwaukee Bucks (28/30),"I'm back with yet another All-Time team in this series with the All-Time Milwaukee Bucks up to bat. Rules are as usual; 2-4 players at each position, players are included based on their tenure with the team, and I can move players out of position if I feel that's what's best for the team but I can only move them one position up or down. I don't do this a majority of the time, but I do have cases where I move a few players around. Anyways, here is the All-Time Bucks squad.

**Head Coach: Don Nelson (1976-87)**

Accolades w/Team: 540-344 Regular Season Record, 42-46 Playoff Record

**Assistant Coach: Larry Costello (1968-76)**

Accolades w/Team: 410-264 Regular Season Record, 37-23 Playoff Record, 2 Finals Appearances, 1x NBA Champion

**Assistant Coach: George Karl (1998-03)**

Accolades w/Team: 205-173 Regular Season Record, 14-18 Playoff Record

&#x200B;

**PG1: Oscar Robertson (1970-74)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 1x NBA Champion, 2x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 16.3 PPG, 4.9 RPG, 7.5 APG, 1.1 SPG, 0.1 BPG

The Milwaukee Bucks acquired Oscar Robertson in a trade after the 1969-70 season, and it turned out to be a huge trade for the franchise. Robertson averaged 19.4 PPG, 5.7 RPG, and 8.2 APG during his first season in Milwaukee which earned him a selection on the All-NBA 2nd Team and helped the Bucks win their first and only NBA championship despite only being in their third season as the Big O averaged 23.5 PPG, 5 RPG, and 9.5 APG in four NBA Finals games against the Baltimore Bullets. Robertson continued to start at point guard for the contending Bucks over the next three seasons as he averaged 15.1 PPG, 4.6 RPG, and 7.2 APG during that span. Robertson was very valuable to the Bucks as he helped lead them to four division titles in all four of his seasons with them, and they missed the playoffs in the seasons after he retired.

&#x200B;

**PG2: Sam Cassell (1999-03)**

Stats: 19 PPG, 4 RPG, 7.2 APG, 1.2 SPG, 0.1 BPG

The Bucks acquired Sam Cassell during the 1999 lockout season in a three-team deal that involved the Timberwolves and the Nets. He didn’t do much for them during that season as he played in just four games while averaging 13.8 PPG and 4.3 APG. However, Cassell bounced back in his first full season in Milwaukee as he averaged 18.6 PPG, 3.7 RPG, and 9 APG. Over the next three seasons, Cassell continued to be the starting point guard for the Bucks, and he was important to the team as he averaged 19.2 PPG, 4.1 RPG, and 6.7 APG during that span which included an appearance in the Eastern Conference Finals in 2001. However, the Bucks traded Cassell to the Timberwolves after the 2002-03 season.

&#x200B;

**SG1: Sidney Moncrief (1979-89)**

Accolades w/Team: 5x All-Star, 2x Defensive Player of the Year, 1x All-NBA 1st Team, 4x All-NBA 2nd Team, 4x All-Defensive 1st Team, 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 16.7 PPG, 5 RPG, 3.9 APG, 1.3 SPG, 0.3 BPG

Drafted fifth overall by the Milwaukee Bucks in the NBA Draft, Sidney Moncrief was a solid player for the franchise during his first two seasons as he averaged 11.3 PPG, 4.7 RPG, and 2.5 APG during that span. However, Sid the Squid broke out in his third season as he averaged 19.8 PPG, 6.7 RPG, and 4.8 APG en route to his first All-NBA selection as well as a selection to the All-Defensive 2nd Team. Moncrief continued to be one of the best guards in the NBA on both ends of the court over the next four seasons as he averaged 21.3 PPG, 5.6 RPG, 4.6 APG, and 1.5 SPG during that span while making an All-NBA team and All-Defensive 1st Team in each of those seasons as well as winning the first two ever Defensive Player of the Year awards. However, knee and foot injuries caught up to Moncrief as he slowed down in his final three seasons as he averaged 11.6 PPG, 3.1 RPG, and 3.3 APG during that span before retiring after the 1988-89 season.

&#x200B;

**SG2: Ray Allen (1996-03)**

Accolades w/Team: 3x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 19.6 PPG, 4.6 RPG, 3.8 APG, 1.3 SPG, 0.2 BPG

Drafted fifth overall in the 1996 NBA draft, Ray Allen had a solid rookie season as the Bucks’ starting shooting guard as he averaged 13.4 PPG, 4 RPG, and 2.6 APG. After that rookie year, Jesus Shuttlesworth improved over his next two seasons as he averaged 18.6 PPG, 4.7 RPG, and 4 APG during that span. However, Allen made the All-Star team in each of the next three seasons while changing his game from primarily a slasher to a sharpshooter as he averaged 22 PPG, 4.7 RPG, and 4.1 APG during that span while shooting 43% from three-point range with a total of 603 three-pointers made over those three seasons, which was the most from 1999-2002. He also led the Bucks to the Eastern Conference Finals during the 2000-01 season. After averaging 21.3 PPG, 4.6 RPG, and 3.5 APG in the first 47 games of the 2002-03 season with the Bucks, Ray Allen was traded to the Seattle Supersonics during that season.

&#x200B;

**SG3: Michael Redd (2000-11)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 20 PPG, 4 RPG, 2.3 APG, 1 SPG, 0.1 BPG

Michael Redd turned out to the best draft pick in the lackluster 2000 NBA Draft despite being drafted with the 43rd overall pick. He only played in 6 games in his rookie season, but he improved over the next two seasons as he averaged 13.5 PPG and 4 RPG while coming off the bench for a majority of those games. However, Redd had a huge breakout year in the 2003-04 season as he averaged 21.7 PPG, 5 RPG, and 2.3 APG en route to his first All-Star selection as well as a selection to the All-NBA 3rd Team. Redd never made the All-Star team again, but he improved his scoring over the next three seasons as he averaged 24.8 PPG, 4.1 RPG, and 2.5 APG during that span which included averaging 26.7 PPG in the 2006-07 season. He averaged 22.2 PPG, 4 RPG, and 3.2 APG over the next two seasons. Unfortunately, during the latter of those two seasons, Redd tore his left ACL and MCL after 32 games. He was never the same player as he played in just 28 more games with the Bucks before signing with the Suns for the 2011-12 season.

&#x200B;

**SG4: Brian Winters (1975-83)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star

Stats: 16.7 PPG, 2.7 RPG, 4.3 APG, 1.2 SPG, 0.3 BPG

After his rookie season with the L.A. Lakers, Brian Winters was traded, with a few other players, to the Milwaukee Bucks for Hall of Fame center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. He was really good in his first season with the team as he averaged 18.2 PPG, 3.2 RPG, and 4.7 APG en route to his first All-Star selection. Over the next three seasons, the 6’4” shooting guard averaged 19.7 PPG, 2.8 RPG, and 4.7 APG during that span while making his second All-Star team in the latter of those three seasons. After averaging 13.7 PPG, 2.4 RPG, and 3.7 APG in his final four seasons, Winters retired after the 1982-83 season. Speaking of Brian Winters, the one and only Michael Jordan called him the best pure shooter of all-time in 2005 due to his beautiful stroke.

&#x200B;

**SF1: Marques Johnson (1977-84)**

Accolades w/Team: 4x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 1st Team, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 21 PPG, 7.5 RPG, 3.7 APG, 1.3 SPG, 0.8 BPG

Drafted third overall by the Milwaukee Bucks in the 1977 NBA Draft, Marques Johnson was a really good player in his rookie season as he averaged 19.5 PPG, 10.6 RPG, and 2.4 APG. Although he never averaged that many rebounds again, he improved a lot in his sophomore season as he averaged 25.6 PPG, 7.6 RPG, and 3 APG on 55% shooting en route to a selection on the All-NBA 1st Team. Marques Johnson continued to be an excellent scorer over the next five seasons as he averaged 20.3 PPG, 6.8 RPG, and 4.1 APG during that span while shooting 52.6% from the field which resulted in an All-Star selection in three of those five seasons as well as two more All-NBA selections. Although his scoring was off the charts, even as he slowly became the second option to Sidney Moncrief, Johnson was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers before the 1984-85 season for power forward Terry Cummings.

&#x200B;

**SF2: Bob Dandridge (1969-77, 1981)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 1x NBA Champion, 3x All-Star

Stats: 18.6 PPG, 7.3 RPG, 3.2 APG, 1.5 SPG, 0.5 BPG

Although Bob Dandridge was drafted in the fourth round of the 1969 NBA Draft, he turned out to be a great pick for the Bucks as he averaged 13.2 PPG, 7.7 RPG, and 3.6 APG in his rookie season. Dandridge improved over the next two seasons as he averaged 18.4 PPG, 7.8 RPG, and 3.3 APG during that span while helping win a championship in the first of those two seasons as he averaged 20.3 PPG, 9.8 RPG, and 3.5 APG in four NBA Finals games against the Baltimore Bullets. Over the next five seasons after the 1971-72 season, Dandridge averaged 20.3 PPG, 7.1 RPG, and 3.1 APG during that span which earned him an All-Star selection in three of those seasons. After the 1976-77 season, Dandridge signed with the Bullets, now in Washington D.C. during the 1977 offseason, but he returned to the Bucks for 11 games in the 1981-82 season before retiring.

&#x200B;

**SF3: Glenn Robinson (1994-02)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star

Stats: 21.1 PPG, 6.2 RPG, 2.8 APG, 1.2 SPG, 0.6 BPG

Drafted first overall by the Milwaukee Bucks in the 1994 NBA Draft, Glenn Robinson was a really good player in his first four seasons despite not making a single All-Star team in that span as he averaged 21.5 PPG, 6.1 RPG, and 3 APG during that span. After averaging 18.4 PPG and 5.9 RPG in the shortened 1999 season while helping the Bucks make the playoffs for the first time since he arrived, Big Dog was selected to the All-Star team in each of the next two seasons as he averaged 21.4 PPG, 6.4 RPG, and 2.8 APG during that span which included an Eastern Conference Finals appearance in the latter of those two seasons. After another really good 2001-02 season with the Bucks as he averaged 20.7 PPG and 6.2 RPG, Robinson was traded to the Atlanta Hawks during the 2002 offseason.

&#x200B;

**SF4: Paul Pressey (1982-90)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Defensive 1st Team, 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 11.9 PPG, 4.3 RPG, 5.6 APG, 1.5 SPG, 0.6 BPG

Paul Pressey helped revolutionize the point forward position during his eight seasons with the Milwaukee Bucks. Pressey averaged 7.5 PPG, 3.5 RPG, and 2.9 APG over his first two seasons, but he improved in his third one as he averaged 16.1 PPG, 5.4 RPG, and 6.8 APG while making the All-Defensive 1st Team as well. Pressey’s scoring decreased a bit over his next four seasons, but he was still an excellent floor general as he averaged 13.4 PPG, 4.7 RPG, 7.2 APG, and 1.8 SPG during that span while being selected to an additional two All-Defensive teams in both 1986 and 1987. After coming off the bench in the 1989-90 season as he averaged 11 PPG, 3 RPG, and 4.3 APG, Pressey was traded to the San Antonio Spurs during the 1990 offseason.

&#x200B;

**PF1: Giannis Antetokounmpo (2013-)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x NBA MVP, 3x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 1st Team, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-Defensive 1st Team, 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 18.8 PPG, 8.3 RPG, 4.1 APG, 1.2 SPG, 1.3 BPG

Drafted 15th overall by the Bucks in the 2013 NBA Draft, Giannis Antetokounmpo has improved in each of his six seasons with the franchise. Giannis was a solid and promising player over his first three seasons as he averaged 12.2 PPG, 6.3 RPG, and 2.9 APG during that span while playing at three (or four) different positions. Giannis’s breakout season would come in the 2016-17 season as he averaged 22.9 PPG, 88 RPG, 5.4 APG, 1.6 SPG, and 1.9 BPG which got him a selection on the All-NBA 2nd Team as well as that year’s Most Improved Player. Giannis followed up that campaign with an even better 2017-18 season as he averaged 26.9 PPG, 10 RPG, 4.8 APG, 1.5 SPG, and 1.4 BPG en route to his second All-NBA 2nd Team selection. It doesn’t stop there for the Greek Freak as he was even better in this past season as he averaged 27.7 PPG, 12.5 RPG, 5.9 APG, 1.3 SPG, and 1.5 BPG in 32.8 MPG while leading the Bucks to the NBA’s record which garnered him an All-NBA 1st Team selection as well as this past year’s MVP award. Heading into the 2019-20 season, Giannis looks to improve even more and could potentially help the Bucks win their first NBA championship since 1971 after he led them to the Conference Finals in this past postseason.

**PF2: Terry Cummings (1984-89, 1995-96)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 19.4 PPG, 7.8 RPG, 2.3 APG, 1.3 SPG, 0.7 BPG

Terry Cummings was acquired by the Milwaukee Bucks before the 1984-85 season for former Bucks All-Star Marques Johnson and was really good in his first season with the franchise as he averaged 23.6 PPG and 9.1 RPG which helped him make the All-Star team and the All-NBA 2nd Team. After averaging 20.6 PPG and 8.1 RPG over the next three seasons, Cummings returned to the All-Star team in the 1988-89 season as he averaged 22.9 PPG and 8.1 RPG which also resulted in a selection to the All-NBA 3rd Team. Despite an excellent 1988-89 season, he was traded after that season to the San Antonio Spurs. He returned to the Bucks for an uneventful 1995-96 season where he averaged 8 PPG and 5.5 RPG off the bench before signing with the Sonics for the next season.

&#x200B;

**PF3: Vin Baker (1993-97)**

Accolades w/Team: 3x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 18.3 PPG, 9.5 RPG, 2.7 APG, 0.9 SPG, 1.3 BPG

Drafted eighth overall in the 1993 NBA Draft, Vin Baker was solid in his rookie season as he averaged 13.5 PPG and 7.6 RPG. However, Baker moved from center to power forward in his second season which caused him to improve and average 17.7 PPG, 10.3 RPG, and 3.6 APG which got him selected to the All-Star team for the first time. Vin Baker saw even more improvement over the next two seasons as he averaged 21 PPG, 10.1 RPG, and 2.6 APG during that span which got him two more All-Star selections as well as his first All-NBA selection in the 1996-97 season. Despite Baker’s excellent play, the Bucks never made the playoffs in his four years there and he was traded to the Sonics before the 1997-98 season.

&#x200B;

**C1: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1969-75)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 1x NBA Champion, 1x Finals MVP, 3x NBA MVP, 6x All-Star, 1969-70 Rookie of the Year, 4x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 2x All-Defensive 1st Team, 2x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 30.4 PPG, 15.3 RPG, 4.3 APG, 1.2 SPG, 3.4 BPG

After an accomplished four seasons at UCLA where he won three national championships, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, then known as Lew Alcindor, was drafted first overall by the Milwaukee Bucks in the 1969 NBA Draft. He thrived in his rookie season as he averaged 28.8 PPG, 14.5 RPG, and 4.1 APG while making the All-NBA 2nd Team and winning that year’s Rookie of the Year as helped the Bucks win 56 games despite playing in just their second season. The next season was even better for Kareem as he averaged 31.7 PPG, 16 RPG, and 3.3 APG while winning the regular season MVP and helping the Bucks win their first championship in just their third season as he won Finals MVP by averaging 27 PPG, 18.5 RPG, and 2.8 APG in four NBA Finals games against the Baltimore Bullets. Kareem continued to be the most dominant center in the league for the Bucks over the next four seasons as he averaged 30.5 PPG, 15.4 RPG, 4.6 APG, 1.2 SPG, and 3.4 BPG during that span which helped him win two more MVPs in Milwaukee and helped the Bucks reach the NBA Finals again in 1974. However, without point guard Oscar Robertson, the Bucks fell to 38 wins in the 1974-75 season, and a disgruntled Abdul-Jabbar was traded to the Lakers after that season after he demanded a trade.

&#x200B;

**C2: Bob Lanier (1980-84)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star

Stats: 13.5 PPG, 5.9 RPG, 2.7 APG, 1 SPG, 0.9 BPG

Bob Lanier was acquired by the Milwaukee Bucks in a trade during the 1979-80 season after nine-and-a-half excellent seasons with the Detroit Pistons. Lanier averaged 15.7 PPG and 6.9 RPG in 26 games for the Bucks that season as he sacrificed his stats for the benefit of the Bucks as he helped them to a 20-6 record during the games he played for them. Lanier averaged 13.3 PPG, 5.8 RPG, and 2.7 APG over the final four seasons while playing a lesser role than he did in Detroit, but he was still selected to an All-Star game with the Bucks. Lanier would retire after the 1983-84 season where he put up 13.6 PPG and 6.3 RPG.

**TL;DR All-Time Bucks Roster**

||Starters|Reserves|
|:-|:-|:-|
|PG|**Oscar Robertson**|Sam Cassell|
|SG|**Sidney Moncrief**|Ray Allen, Michael Redd, Brian Winters|
|SF|**Marques Johnson**|Bob Dandridge, Glenn Robinson, Paul Pressey|
|PF|**Giannis Antetokounmpo**|Terry Cummings, Vin Baker|
|C|**Kareem Abdul-Jabbar**|Bob Lanier|
||*Head Coach*|*Assistant Coaches*|
|Coaching Staff|Don Nelson|Larry Costello, George Karl|

**Analysis**

* The All-Time Bucks starting lineup is one of the better starting lineups for an All-Time team. There are no weak links offensively as Oscar and Moncrief were both excellent playmakers, and all five of these guys in the starting five could score. Kareem and Giannis will wreak havoc inside with the former's sky hook that was very hard to guard as well as the Greek Freak's ability to drive and dunk on opponents. Don't forget about Giannis's playmaking as well as Oscar and Sid's scoring either. Also, Marques Johnson was one of the best scorers during the best seasons in the NBA. This starting lineup has some really good defensive pieces with Giannis, Kareem, and Moncrief.
* In the second unit, Sam Cassell and Bob Lanier don't stand out that much, but they were team players that will get the other bench guys going. Cassell was a very good playmaker and scorer and Lanier was very good at scoring inside. The best guys off the bench are sharpshooting and slashing Ray Allen as well as solid inside presence Terry Cummings and solid all-around scorer Bob Dandridge who also was very good at defense and rebounding.

1843,848,What could Houston realistically achieve if they blew up their team?,"I keep seeing posts about Capella, Gordon, Tucker, and CP3 being on the trade market. I just don't see how they could trade CP3 so his contract will probably remain on the books unless packaged. If they trade away the other three, what chance of them being good enough to compete are there in the upcoming years of Harden's prime? This move just doesn't make sense to me so I keep coming back to the r/nba theory that their owner is being very stingy with money.",nbadiscussion
1844,849,What’s Up With Russell Westbrook?,"Full disclosure: I’m a Thunder fan and a Russ defender and this is a long post

Russell Westbrook is still averaging a triple double for a third season at 20.2/10.7/10.2 but on shooting splits of 42/25/61 compared to 43/35/85 and his scoring is down 5 PPG from last year and 11 PPG from his MVP season.

So what gives?

**1. Free throw shooting rule change**

This rule change hurt Russell Westbrook more than any other player. He couldn’t walk out to half court and reset between FTs because a delay of game is called. Going back to UCLA he has always had the same FT routine, and down to his pregame ritual of PB&J made by himself he likes his routines.  This is a hit to his scoring and he’d be closer to 22 or 23 PPG if he was hitting his FTs at 85%

**2. Integration of new teammates**

Russ also has had a ton of roster turnover in the last few years. Since the departure of KD, here are the starting lineups:

2016-2017 (MVP year) Russ, Oladipo, Roberson, Sabonis, Adams 6th man- Kanter

2017-2018 Russ, Roberson/Brewer, PG, Melo, Adams 6th man- Felton?  Nobody really

Russ started really cold coming off of a knee scope and came out of the gate passing up a ton of looks to get Melo(failed experiment) and PG going.  Around this time last year, he focused on being a scoring threat (19 PPG in October on 15 FGA to 27 PPG in January on 22 FGA) and ended up looking like his old self (which is why I’m not excessively worried)

2018-2019 Russ, Ferguson, PG, Grant, Adams 6th man- Schroeder

Again, Russ had PRP injections in his knee and the ankle injury suffered against New Orleans, so he is not 100% healthy yet and is playing himself back

This year he still has PG as a primary scoring option and has the most roster continuity he’s had since the 2016 WCF run and the Thunder are winning games with his 20 PPG on 18 FGA.  He’s never been an efficient scorer (and especially from deep as a 30% overall), but his finishing around the rim is only at 50%. I also want to point out that Westbrook’s defense is **better than it’s ever been and he leads the NBA with 2.7 steals per game** with Paul George not far behind.  He’s making winning plays on defense now that he doesn’t have to do it all on the offensive end.

**3. Shot selection/Final Thoughts**

That little pullup midrange jumper from the elbow that was MONEY in the MVP season and also helped him space the floor a little?  It’s pretty much gone from his arsenal and he doesn’t quite have the touch he used to on those bank shots. 


He’s probably **too bulky** like he’s come into the season the last two years and he needs to play himself slimmer as the season goes on.  He also just had twins, so I think his sleep schedule may not be great right now (fun fact his twins are named Skye and Jordyn and he’s an Air Jordan athlete). I think Russ will be fine as the season wears on and he can get a little more rhythm and get into basketball shape as the year goes on. I think he should take those midrange shots in the flow of the offense to try to get his shot to fall a little more, and he’s also going for contested layups where he’d usually go in for the dunk, which makes me think he’s not in shape. (This could be how he altered his game with age as well so I’m not sure either way). He’s not getting all the calls that Harden and such get so he’s gotten **10 technicals** on the year, so as his FTAs regress positively, we should see Russ drop a couple of 40 point games later in the season. This might be the best Thunder team we’ve seen since 2016, but we need Russ to be Russ to try to challenge the Warriors with our length and defensive ability.

Overall, if this slump continues past the ASB I think concern is warranted but I think (and hope) Russ will be fine

Thanks for reading!  Hope to read your thoughts about Westbrook as well.

**Kobe Bryant per 36**: 21.4 pts, 4.2 reb, 3.5 ast, 2.7 TO, 42.8 FG%, 34.1 3P%

**Tracy McGrady per 36**: 14.9 pts, 9.0 reb, 3.7 ast, 2.6 TO, 43.6 FG%, 22.9% 3P%

This comparison just makes Luka look even more promising in my eyes. Obviously defense and teammates aren’t accounted for here, but Luka seems to be on track to be an absolute offensive superstar in the near future.

1846,851,Are the 09 Magic under appreciated?,"The 09 Magic are often overlooked in NBA history. It's the easily forgotten break between our most recent Lakers/Celtics finals clashes, or at most seen as the reason we never got a Kobe/LeBron finals. But after watching some of the 09 finals earlier today, I was struck by how much that team foreshadowed the future of the NBA without being given credit for it.

&#x200B;

The easiest reason that they're dismissed is probably that they never reached that level again, and were arguably just on a run of playing above their true talent level at the right time of the year. Also, Dwight's incredibly promising career has left a bitter aftertaste the last few years. I think this does a disservice to the roster, and especially SVG's forward thinking coaching, though.

&#x200B;

First of all, Dwight is an all time great, regardless of how he's fallen off (or become a locker room cancer). 3 time DPoY, All-NBA and All-Defensive 1st teams for 4 years straight, plus plenty of other accolades, etc. He is rightfully criticized for the choices he's made and play style he favors (/demands), but some of it can also be attributed to the back injury that derailed his career. As for the rest of the roster, there were no other superstars (Lewis and Nelson were the next two biggest players), but plenty of solid NBA players that went on to have long careers in the league (guys like JJ Redick, Gortat, Courtney Lee, Turkoglu).

&#x200B;

But the thing that stood out to me most was the play style. More than maybe any team in the league in that whole era, you could pluck them out of time and place them in todays league and they would fit right in. Spacing was huge; both deep spacing with a plethora of snipers (including Lewis, who was the exception rather than the rule as a stretch 4 at the time), and vertical spacing with Dwight in his prime feasting inside. This was also before the criticism of not being a ""back to the basket"" big had gotten to Dwight, so he was still in the mold of today's rim runners in many ways.

&#x200B;

The Magic in 09 were 26th in FG/FGA, and 30th in 2P/2PA, yet they were 10th in total PTS and 11th in ORtg. This is because they were remarkably efficient; top 3 in 3P, 3PAr, FTr, and eFG%, getting the bulk of their shots in the right ways. And defensively, ensuring the other team wasn't; top 3 also in opponents' 3P/3PA/3P% and eFG%, and the top DRtg in the league. They forced the second most 2PA, but at the lowest 2P% in the league; all while allowing the 4th lowest FTr. They also had the 3rd lowest OFT%, which could be luck, or could be that the bulk of the fouls they were giving were against bigs that don't shoot well.

&#x200B;

Regardless, the Magic seemed ahead of their time. The Celtics had just won the Finals the year before in large part to Thibs's defensive evolution after zone rule changes, and already the following year we saw a team playing with what would become in many ways the blueprint for the response to that defense, the results of which we're seeing today.

&#x200B;

Looking back, maybe the reason they aren't looked at as trend setters (like the SSoL Suns, for example) is that they had the right system, but the wrong talent allocation. Instead of solid perimeter play to give spacing for dominant bigs, the league now demands solid interior play to give spacing to dominant perimeter players. Even the next generation of bigs in this league is shooting 3s and facing up defenders from outside.

&#x200B;

Still, I think the Magic, and SVG especially, deserve credit for being a bridge between the grinding style of the 00s and the efficiency based offenses and defenses of today's NBA.

1847,852,What if the OKC Thunder never traded for Paul George and/or Carmelo Anthony?,"Following the conclusion of Russell Westbrook's MVP campaign and the 2016-17 season, Thunder GM set into motion 2 trades that were lauded as franchise saving in the wake of Kevin Durant's shock decision to sign with the Golden State Warriors. The first was a trade for Pacers star Paul George, sending their second leading scorer from the 2017 team Victor Oladipo, and promising young bigman Domantas Sabonis in exchange. The second was for all time great scorer Carmelo Anthony, sending Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott and a second (which became Mitchell Robinson) as compensation.

We know how these trades panned out. Anthony was a serviceable scorer who nonetheless stalled the offence and contributed little on defence, and was soon on his way to the Hawks in exchange for Dennis Schroeder. Paul George was great for the team and signed an extension, before leaving to the Clippers after an MVP worthy season in exchange for Danilo Gallinari, Shai Gilgeous Alexander and a war chest of draft picks.

However, what we don't know is what OKC would have looked like had these trades not taken place. Oladipo and Sabonis went on to have all star calibre seasons at different times on the Pacers. Kanter was an important piece for the Portland Trail Blazers in the 2019 playoffs. McDermott was (and surprisingly still is) a great three point shooter and spacing tool for multiple teams. 

I personally believe this growth and development still would have occurred had these players stayed on the Thunder. For Russ' entire tenure on that squad, spacing was their number one issue. Looking at the players who they traded for George and Anthony, Oladipo shot 37% from three the next season, McDermott shot 38%, Sabonis shot a respectable for a big man 35%, and we don't talk about Enes Kanter outside of the paint. George added spacing and an extra scorer, but Melo did nothing but act as an offensive black hole who didn't shoot the three well.

Imagine, if you will, a roster of Russ, Oladipo, Roberson,  Sabonis, and Adams, with a bench featuring the likes of Jerami Grant, Doug McDermott, Mitchell Robinson, and Terrance Ferguson. I don't think this team would be better than the PG teams right away, but I think with time the team could develop to be as good or better as the Russ/PG teams at their apex. Maybe even better than OKC currently is.

What do y'all think?",nbadiscussion
1848,853,14s shot clock after off. reb. has inflated all stats,"You always hear that the pace of the game has changed so much and players are taking more 3PT shots, but no one points to the 14second Shot Clock Reset after an offensive rebound. NBA Games will average approx 20 offensive rebounds per game which under this new rule, would have eliminated an extra 200 seconds off  the shot clock. That's more possessions each per nba player, and more FGA attempts.

What kinda gets me a bit irk'd is seeing posts like "" X player joins the likes of: MJ, Kobe etc"" or ""No one has reached this level since Wilt"" etc. 

Of all of the seasons, these past two have been the absolute most inflated as far as stats go and I feel like  without deflating everyone's stats, you can't compare someone's stats from this era from the previous(yet you see it ALL the time on r/nba).

1850,855,The Dallas Mavericks have five players taking three or more 3pt shots per game while making them at a percentage above 35% (4 of them are above 38%). Not a single one of those players has a FT% above 80%.,"Currently, the team's percentage of 3PTers that are assisted is 81.5, good for a ranking of 19th.  Their collective ast/tov ratio is 22.8/15.7 which is well behind some of the best teams who have a roughly 2/1 ast/tov ratio.  So they're taking slightly more contested three-pointers than league average while distributing the ball far worse than the best teams overall which leads me to believe that they will continue to struggle to get their guys open looks.  Also, 3 out of those 5 players are currently shattering their career highs in 3pt%, with the other two posting their highest 3pt% while having been with the Mavericks (Matthews had a higher one with Portland and Barnes had his career high with Golden State).  Is it time to short the Mavericks?  They've been red hot, but it doesn't look like that will continue, at least not in the shooting department.  I was tempted to hedge my southwest division futures bet with them when they were at 25-1, but I'm kind of glad I didn't.  I had a really strong feeling that they would go through a major slump at some point in the season while being led by a rookie.  After seeing these numbers, I certainly have more conviction now that they will slump.  Maybe Carlisle can keep them in the playoff race, but I don't see this team winning this division without a trade.

1851,856,Which contract was valued incorrectly: Harrison Barnes or Malcolm Brogdon?,"I think it has been clear for multiple years that Brogdon is the better asset, and that’s been proven thus far this season. Both signed for 4 years / $85 million this summer.

I first off cannot believe that no team tried harder to land Brogdon. He was flawless last year and deserved at least $100 mil. And there’s not a single team/ style of play that he wouldn’t fit into and immediately raise the level. First team that comes to mind is Philly, who I will never understand what inspired them to max their 4th or 5th best player. Did they not consider that Brogdon would round out their starting lineup to perfection at half the price? this basically applies to every big fish (LAL, DAL, HOU) it just does not make sense that they let Indiana steal an all star.  

And how are Kings fans supposed to feel about Harrison Barnes?  What exactly is the point of giving him that kind of money, especially from a rebuilding team? His best role was w Golden State: as the 5th best player that never had to create offense. He has this incredible reputation, and I’m not sure if there’s a reason for it other than him being a #1 overall recruit and everyone raving about his character. And teams just accept that and pay him like he “deserves” while players who bring similar if not more value (Marcus Smart, Covington) go for half the price. He didn’t deserve to be on the Olympic team, and he doesn’t deserve to have over double the career earnings of Lou Will. Am I missing something or is he just (half joking) an Ivy League Moe Harkless?",nbadiscussion
1852,857,Clippers and the triangle offense,"Do you guys think this Clippers team would benefit greatly from running the triangle offense? In phil jackson's stint with the bulls and lakers, the system seemed to be at its maximum effectiveness when theres a competent post player who can kick out effectively and a wing who can create their own shot as a last resort. The clipper now have wings in kawhi and george who have a great size advantage over their defensive matchups plus are great post players as well. Both are good facilitators and can create their own shit with ease. Furthermore, the team is also built with players who can spot up and cut in pretty effectively when you look at Patrick Beverly, Landry Shamet and not to mention both Paul and kawhi can also fill in these roles seamlessly. 

I understand this team is extremely talented and could just reap the benefits of their talents through simple plays like ""pick and rolls"" and ""isos"" through their stars. Just hope someone can expand on this or explain to me why it would be a good or bad idea to do so. If it's not a good idea, what would you recommend instead.",nbadiscussion
1853,858,What current NBA player is it hardest to evaluate because they have yet to play with the right supporting cast?,"I was replying to a post earlier asking for people's opinions on Julius Randle and while I felt that many people brought up great points on why they feel the way they do about him, I had a hard time trying to decide how I felt about him and where I would put him talent wise amongst NBA bigs because, in my mind, he has yet to play with the correct big man partner to help show himself in his best light and provide a clear picture of what he can do. This led me to start looking through teams and trying to see what other players I felt this way about and I found a good number of players who, like Randle, I could see myself seeing a considerable range of stances on them being viable given their past supporting cast limitations. I don't want to list off all my players to avoid tainting the results below so I'll just stick with mentioning Randle in my post and will hopefully chime in on others that show up in the comments.

To explain what I mean using my example above, I dont think I can accurately assess Julius Randle until I see him paired with a big who can stretch the floor on the offensive end allowing him to act as the team's primary interior big, but then have his partner act as the primary rim protector letting Randle cover the opponent's 4. The closest player he's shared the floor with would likely be Nikola Mirotic, but I would like to see him with a Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, or Dewayne Dedmond type player. Then I think it would be pretty clear what level of player Randle is capable of being.

I have to believe other people feel this way about some NBA guys too and I'm curious who everyone else thinks has plenty of room for interpretation to where if they get paired with the right player archetype(s) then we might consider them a completely different player than we do now. More importantly though, out of all of these kinds of players, who do you think is the hardest player to get a clear read on currently?

Edit: My mistake on forgetting that Randle and Lopez played together only a couple seasons ago in LA. The sample size isn't as big as I'd like before I draw conclusions about a player (14.4 minutes per game in 68 games), but he did have a great season finishing around the rim (68.8% inside 10 ft.) and while I can't find a way to get these numbers only during their time on the court together I think just the huge spike during that lone season is significant. However, I think current day Randle is different than he was two seasons ago due to his large increase in both volume and efficiency from 3 last year. This would open up room for him and others to drive and create for themselves that the Lakers simply couldn't create given his poor shooting at the time. To sum up my thoughts after realizing my mistake. Randle has enough experience with this player archetype to make him far from the most difficult to judge player. However, after his evolution last season I still want to see him play with this kind of big again before I get to firm in my views.

Once again, sorry to have missed this recent example and thank you for bringing it to my attention.",nbadiscussion

1855,860,[O'Connell from The Ringer] The Three Steve Kerr Adjustments That Tipped the NBA Finals Back in the Warriors’ Favor,"https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/6/3/18650472/warriors-raptors-final-game-2-steve-kerr-coaching-adjustments

If you like x's and o's this is a pretty great article detailing adjustments made for Game 2. In short these are the 3 adjustments but I would highly suggest reading the whole thing. There's good clips to show the actions.:

1.Turning the NBA Finals Into a Hockey Game

> In Game 1, the Warriors set the majority of their on-ball screens close to the 3-point line. On Sunday, they set many of them near the logo, including in the play above. By setting ball screens closer to half court, the Warriors paid homage to their Canadian hosts by creating the basketball equivalent of a hockey power play.

2 . Going From Small Ball to Boogie Ball

> Warriors have outscored teams by 13.9 points per 100 possessions in the playoffs when Curry and Green have been in the game without another big man alongside them, per PBP Stats. Especially following Durant’s injury, you’d think that Kerr would lean on this duo as much as possible in the Finals, but Draymond didn’t play a single minute at center in Game 1. Entering Game 2, the expectation was that Kerr would unleash it. Nah. Instead, Kerr featured Green at center for only three minutes (and the Warriors were outscored 8-5) and went about supersizing Golden State’s lineups.

> DeMarcus Cousins started Game 2 and played 28 minutes, tallying 11 points, 10 rebounds, and six assists. Bogut came off the bench and went 3-for-3 from the field in seven quality minutes. Kerr often screws around at the center position, starting Bogut or Jordan Bell over Kevon Looney, who’s his team’s best option there. Starting Cousins seemed like the coach’s next goofy choice. But Boogie’s playmaking in the post quickly made it apparent why Kerr went this direction.

3 . Putting Draymond in Position to Thrive on Help D

> Nurse must find better ways for the Raptors to attack Cousins on defense moving forward, but it’s not like he didn’t try in Game 2. Toronto ran countless pick-and-rolls against Boogie, but the Warriors neutralized their effect by dropping the big man and happily allowing Gasol to shoot from deep. Gasol often hesitated, and even if the Raptors attacked the paint, Cousins had help as a result of Kerr’s other changes.

> The Warriors opened the second half with Thompson defending Leonard, either Iguodala or Draymond guarding Kyle Lowry, and whoever wasn’t on Lowry sagging off Pascal Siakam. It worked wonderfully: Lowry can shoot but is an infrequent cutter, so two defenders as intelligent as Iggy and Green were able to successfully help off the ball to halt other players’ drives, keep track of Lowry, and afford themselves enough time to recover.

1856,861,Have we seen spacing to it’s fullest potential yet?,"So pretty much what I’m asking is, have we seen a lineup with 5 real shooters? 

Like the warriors always had Draymond and even the one year he shot well they had Bogut 

The Rockets take a bunch but they’ve played with a traditional big and now even without Capela Westbrook is a non shooter, Tucker and Covington are not knockdown guys and don’t have a comfort level taking a lot of 3s 

Dallas looks to have a lot of spacing on paper, but Luka is still iffy (I know a lot of it is tough shots) and Kristaps has the Lauri Markannen effect going on where we all just kind of decided he’s a great shooter but the numbers don’t back it up in 3 out of his 4 seasons 

What’s the best shooting lineup that’s been thrown out there? One where all 5 players are good enough to shoot when open without hesitation and there’s not a weaker link that teams can live with getting open shots 

Do you guys think there’s a higher level of spacing we’ve yet to see in the NBA? 

And also, what teams do you think are candidates to build this way? 

The Timberwolves have the best shooting center in history, so that’s a big boost right there. D’Lo though is a career 36% shooter, which is good at his volume, but not someone I think teams panic when they see open from 3. Their other young guys who I really like in Culver and Okogie don’t shoot very well either 

The Grizzlies have JJJ who’s a knockdown shooter and can play the 5, but Ja’s someone teams will live with shooting, Brandon Clarke shot well this year but at low volume 

Will we ever see someone have a lineup with all five players shooting 40% or above on decent volume without it being bad defensively?",nbadiscussion
1857,862,Have the NBA and the evolution of Basketball made it harder for players to win several MVP titles with a gap of several seasons between titles ?,"I noticed that except LeBron James between 2009 & 2013, no player in the NBA has won several MVPs with even a season seperating their them since Karl Malone in 99 : 

- Tim Duncan : Won in 2002 & 2003
- Steve Nash : Won in 2005 & 2006
- LeBron James : Won in 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 (outlier)
- Stephen Curry : Won in 2015 & 2016
- Giannis might be en route in 2019 & 2020 but still too early to tell, but still confirms my point 

Do you think this pattern will become a trend, where players tend to win MVPs in a bulk rather than having them split with seasons in between ?

One could factor in the fact that there is voter fatigue, or that players tend to rest more during the regular season when getting old which could be a consequence of the game being harder on the body. Could that also be a consequence of a lack of interest from players to win it when they leave their peak ? 

It seems like it has also become harder to win the MVP title once players ""leave"" their physical prime. In the past few years, MVP winners have usually had exceptional seasons while other players performed well (James Harden in 2017, LeBron in 2018, KD and Harden in 2016 though the race wasn't that close). 

Talking about previous multiple MVP winners with several seasons in between: 

- Michael Jordan : First MVP in 88 and last in 98 (record for biggest gap between first and last title)
- Kareem Abdul Jabbar : First in 71, last in 80
- Wilt : First in 60, last in 67
- Bill Russell : First in 58, last in 65
- Moses Malone : First in 79, last in 83

Thoughts on this? I don't think Donovan is the sole reason for OKC's troubles but he's one of the only things that they can deal with immediately. They can't fire or trade Russ, nor can they directly impact his shot selection. I think keeping Donovan is a step in the wrong direction. OKC's roster isn't built all that great for the stars they have, but their system still isn't built properly.",nbadiscussion
1860,865,Something that I think has gone under the radar...Rudy Gay,"I think this is very interesting because throughout his career Rudy Gay has always been seen as an ""empty stats"" player because he's inefficient, doesn't play good defense, and isn't a good passer. Whether it was the Grizzlies, Raptors, or Kings, his teams have done better after he has left as well.

I'm not going to lie and tell you that I've watched many Spurs games, but I have been seeing him play better and the stats surely do back it up this season.

This season he is averaging career highs in FG%, 3P%, 2P%, eFG%, TS%, WS/48, and AST:TO ratio. He's doing this on the lowest field goal attempts of his career as a starter, and his lowest USG% since his rookie year.

Of course, playing on the Spurs under the GOAT NBA coach Pop certainly helps him, but I think we should pay more attention to Rudy Gay's improvement as a player.",nbadiscussion
1861,866,The Rodman-Elliott trade is one of the most one-sided trades ever made,"So the year is 1993 and the Pistons have failed to qualify for the playoffs for the first time in 10 years. Things weren't looking good for them at all, but the same could not be said for their star forward Dennis Rodman. Rodman was a two time All-Star and a two time DPOY who has ended the season leading the league in rebounding for the second time in a row. The thing is, Rodman wasn't in a good place mentally. He was even considering taking his own life. This may or may not have played a part in him demanding a trade that same year. Maybe he needed a change of scenery to deal with his issues? Maybe he just didn't like the direction the Pistons were heading in? Nevertheless it happened and the Pistons tried to at least get something good for him in return. They thought they did so by trading for the Spurs' second leading scorer, Sean Elliott. Boy were they wrong.


Elliott ended up having, at the time, the worst season of his career. He only averaged 12 PPG on, at the time, the worst shooting percentages of his career as well. Oh yeah, the Pistons failed to make the playoffs once again, winning a grand total of 20 games. Meanwhile in San Antonio, the Spurs ended up finishing with the 4th seed with Rodman leading the league in rebounding for a third straight year, but failed to get past the Jazz in the First Round. 


Okay, so here's the funny part. Sean Elliott ended up getting traded back to San Antonio after the season for Bill Curley and a second round pick. Never heard of Bill Curley? Well that's because he only played one season with the Pistons averaging a whooping 2.7 PPG before injuring his ankle. The Pistons didn't make the playoffs in the 94-95 season as well despite Grant Hill's best efforts meanwhile the Spurs were rolling. They had the best record in the league at 62-20, Rodman led the league in rebounding once again and Elliott went back to his old ways, averaging 18 PPG for the season. Oh yeah and there's this one guy, David Robinson, he was kind of the MVP that year too. Sadly for them, Hakeem was on a mission in the WCF, averaging 35.3 PPG against Robinson and Rodman and guiding the Rockets past the Spurs in 6. There's no doubt in my mind that that Spurs team would have dealt with the 95 Magic pretty easily in the Finals.


I don't see this trade getting talked about at all. So essentially the Spurs got a league leader in rebounding and an elite defender in Rodman and a reliable second option on offense in Elliott for a guy who averaged 2.7 points a game for his entire career. That's pretty much a robbery if you ask me.",nbadiscussion
1862,867,Was Kobe's 2004 finals or LeBron's 2011 Finals worse?,"LeBron's per game averages:

* 22.6 points on 22.6 field goal attempts

To me, on paper Kobe's stats look worse, but I didn't watch the 2004 finals so and can't speak to the eye test, defense, etc. I did watch 2011 though and remember LeBron looking like ass, which was made exponentially worse with the decision still fresh in everyone's minds.",nbadiscussion

OKC receives: Kevin Love, 2021 MIL 1st

Miami sends: Hassan Whiteside, 2019 MIA 1st

Miami receives: Steven Adams, 2019 HOU 1st

Why Cleveland does it: Get off the Love contract for an expiring deal while moving up in the 2019 draft

Why OKC does it: They owe a ton of money to Russ til 2023 and to PG til 2022.  Kevin Love is under contract til 2023, so he can be the stretch 4 needed to help these guys out.  This franchise may need a complete rebuild by 2022 or 23, so upgrading a 2nd rounder to a 1st in 2021 may help them out.  They would need to move Jerami Grant to the 5, would be interesting to see a ""Russ + 4 shooters"" approach.

Why Miami does it: They are in a bad space in terms of roster, salaries, and draft picks.  This trade allows them to upgrade at Center, not take on additional salary, and move down in the 2019 draft instead of having to trade a pick away",nbadiscussion
1865,870,How Minnesota can trade Wiggins.,"**Memphis trade**

Minnesota sends: 

+ Wiggins, Saric, 2019-20 unprotected 1st, 2020-21 pick swap(or 2021-22 pick swap), 2022-23 top 8 protected 1st(top 6 protected following year)

Memphis sends: 

+ Conley

Memphis hopefully conveys their pick to Boston this draft and Memphis can embrace the tank for a couple seasons.  If not Memphis is all but assured to be a bottom 6 team next season without Conley and Gasol to overachieve early in the season.  Having the opportunity to pick swap with Minnesota is a risk free opportunity and given the generous lottery odds for middling non playoff teams the Wolves pick could have a chance of jumping into the top 4.  An unprotected 1st from Minnesota next season is a must and there is a decent chance they are a lottery team in a loaded WC.  Saric is a stretch 4 that Memphis could and should build around along with JV and JJjr.

Minnesota sacrifices Saric, and draft capital to unload the albatross that is the Wiggins contract.  Minnesota still keeps who they draft with this years lottery pick and a pick swap with Memphis still would theoretically net a high draft pick .  They lose only one draft pick in the next 3 years so improving the roster without relying on free agents is still possible.  

**Hornets trade**

Minnesota sends: 

+ Wiggins, Saric, Top 8 protected 2021-22 1st round pick, 2018-19 2nd round pick(cheap contract for a cash strapped Hornets team)

Charlotte sends: 

+ Batum.

This is one that Minnesota makes because Batum’s deal is 2 years shorter than Wiggins, Dieng and Batum would come off the books the same offseason allowing Minnesota to overpay for a Khris Middleton/Tobias Harris type free agent while keeping draft capital to build around KAT. 

Charlotte has Lamb hitting free agency and they probably can’t afford to re-sign him if Kemba stays the Maple Jordan could find success in a change of scenery.  Kemba could also walk in free agency and if that happens this trade makes a ton of sense for Charlotte.  The Batum signing has been a disaster trading 2 years of Batum for 4 of Wiggins could hurt but no Kemba allows them to see how Wiggins does as a number 1 and if he still doesn’t take a step forward then moving him in a couple seasons as an expiring wouldn’t be difficult.  Saric is a good player that has shown he is a impressive shooter and underrated defender, and a future 1st is a valuable commodity and given Minnesota is in the Western Conference that could easily be a lottery pick.

1866,871,Rockets vs Lakers Discussion Thread,"The Rockets showed once again that their defense is amazing. They suffocated the Lakers' Paint game.

Robert Covington should be selected to the All-Defensive team. The man is amazing on defense. Good at guarding big men and guards, but what he’s best at is help defense, where he just shines. Extremely smart defensive player.

And on the other hand, there just wasn’t anyone who could guard Harden 1 on 1, they had a few great double teams (from which Rockets came out as winners anyway) and that’s the way you should try to slow down Harden. But when that didn’t happen, [Harden kept driving to the hoop](https://i.imgur.com/Q028ABQ.png) and didn’t take a lot of ""Harden threes"", but rather found better solutions on the offensive side. Westbrook did a good job, I think he can drive to the hoop even better, and Gordon, who redeemed himself for the first 6 terrible games, also played a good role for the second game in a row.

The Lakers tried everything. Their paint game was stifled, Howard and McGee didn’t come to any expression, and they played a lot with Davis on five. Davis did well in 1-on-1, just like LeBron in the 1st half. They will have to reach a little deeper into their pockets and find some other offensive weapons...

1868,873,Would Blake Griffin lower his injury risk if he dropped weight? Even if it means to the point of losing muscle?,"I'm not asking this rhetorically - though I do have some personal thoughts. I'm mostly just curious if anyone knows much about sports medicine and/or general physiology enough to say wether weight plays a significant role in injuries in the NBA - and if that rule/principle would apply to Blake.

My opinion, without knowing much about the subject: I've always observed NBA players generally being fairly lean. LeBron James aside, I don't know many NBA athletes who are known for being 'bulky strong' and not simply 'leg/lean strong.'

And based on the fact that he hasn't really dropped much of that 'thiccness' makes me wonder why that is. Maybe the PT specialists already determined it didn't have to do with weight.. or maybe there was more confidence in modern medicine and the treatments. If so maybe its not fair to put this on Blake for not trying.

On the other hand, maybe he should be criticized for his massive build (Greek god) - being as talented and skilled as he is I think it could be argued that he really doesn't need that amount of raw strength since his earlier years? I don't mean he should be berated for this, just that it seems fair to suggest the load might be taking it's toll.",nbadiscussion

Personally I'm pretty neutral on it since historically 1-8/2-7 matchups aren't that volatile, and upsets regarding those are usually based in injuries or hugely matchup oriented, as with the 2007 Mavs/Dubs series.

1871,876,New York Knicks FA of 2019,"People were talking like this is the end of the world for the Knicks but in reality I think it's not that bad. They've got couple of young players on decent contact value with room for development (Randle, Portis, even Payton) and drafted RJ Barret. They didn't overpay some star on the decline, didn't throw max money on Vucevic or Middleton or somebody of similar quality, and as they won't be PO team next year they have another chance to hit it big on draft day. Also Kris Wilkes can easily turn out be another potentially good undrafted player. So surely more wins and step in the right (well at least slightly better) direction compared to last year.

What all of you think about this?",nbadiscussion
1872,877,[OC] Has the changing distribution of salaries in the NBA made it more difficult to trade for high-end/expensive talent?,"On a recent Bill Simmons podcast, Simmons posited that it has become too difficult to trade for expensive players in the NBA. He argues that players like Chris Paul and Kevin Love are making so much money that few teams have the ability to match salaries in a trade and those teams that do can't make the trade without gutting their entire roster. 

[He fired off a couple of tweets about this yesterday, which I think captures the gist of his discontent](https://twitter.com/BillSimmons/status/1205154632961384448)

His solution is to change the rule so that teams only need to match 50% of the value of the player they're trading for. Under the current system, teams can only take back at most 125% of the salary they send out.

Setting aside whatever you think about Simmons' solution, I do think he's on to something about how difficult it is to trade for the NBA's most expensive players. 

tl;dr: [Here are some charts](https://imgur.com/a/nCXWOKA)

I downloaded the annual salaries for every player since the 2011-12 season from [spotrac](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/rankings/2020/base/) and [plotted the distribution of those salaries each year.](https://imgur.com/AYqNnHe)

As you can see, the distribution of salaries has always been right skewed, meaning a select group of players makes a lot more than the rest of the league. However, over the years, the distribution has only increased in skew-iness. 

In other words, while the distribution has always been unequal to a degree, the distance between the middle class of players and the upper class of players appears to have grown over the past several years. 

[Here is that same chart, but this time with a logged x-axis.](https://imgur.com/a/0jtllDe). 

That little bump around the 100k mark you see in previous years but not this year is from 2-way players who get called up to make a few thousand bucks a game -- usually at the end of the season. 

Another way to think about this is by looking at the average annual salaries for different percentile groups. 

[In this chart](https://imgur.com/zxxEtjy), I plotted the average annual salaries from 2011-12 - 2019-2020 for 5 different groups: 

- The bottom 20% of the league 

- The 21st to 50th percentile 

- The 51st to 80th percentile 

- The 81st to 90th percentile 

- And the 91st to 100th percentile 

Clearly, the average salaries for all five groups has increased since 2012. That shouldnt be surprising with the increase in the salary cap and increasing values in salaries like the Vet-minimum. However, it does appear that the vast most of the gains in salary have been captured by the most expensive players. 

In 2012, the gap between the average salary for a player in top 10% and the average salary for a player in the 51st to 80th percentile was about $9.2M. This year, the gap between those two groups is about $22.4M. 

**My question to you all is does this widening gap between the top 10% and the rest of the league suggest the NBA ought to tinker with the salary matching requirements for trades?**

1873,878,Sixers Early Season Struggles and What to look for as improvement,"
Early in the season the Sixers have struggled on offense and some think they may be less of a contender than preseason predictions had them at. I agree that some of this early season play has been concerning on the offensive end. Time to gel and get right definitely explains some of it, but I think looking ahead two big things will be important if they want to win a championship. 

1. Joel needs to get better at passing out of double teams. Embiid gets doubled by a lot of teams as soon as he catches the ball or if he makes a move toward the basket. It’s actually fairly predictable that the double will come because most teams do it. If Embiid can improve his passing from this spot and lower his turnovers there it would really help the rest of the team. It would result in mismatches all of the court from hitting a cutter or an open guy for a 3 or creating hockey assists and forcing perfect defensive rotation to stop an open shot or drive. Right now Embiid is definitely working on that, but improvement there would be huge for this offense which struggles to get open looks in the half court right now. 


2. Simmons needs to start shooting the corner three. Being able to run sets where Simmons is in the corner and a moderate threat would open up space for pick and roll and pick and pop with Embiid and Horford setting screen and Richardson and Harris ball handling. Could add a new dynamic to the spacing and even if it’s a below league average corner 3 hitting those will be important. This season Ben has Ben videoed taking the corner three in warmups before every game and I definitely think some in game attempts are coming and could really propel this team. Ben does does so many things well already that his shot doesn’t have to be money from every spot. But in the corner forcing close outs on him to drive around, knocking down some open ones, and providing more spacing and probably offense rebounding crashing the glass from there would be great. Like how James Ennis is so successful getting rebounds from corner. I liken Ben’s improvement a lot to Siakams from last year, Siakam wasn’t really a deadly shooter from all over the court, but his corner three was crucial to the Raptors in the playoffs. Obviously Simmons isn’t going to be Danny Green or Kyle Korver from the corner but I think being able to hit from the corner would be a big step for him and his game.

Building off of that I think adding the corner 3 for Ben would really open up Harris and Richardson’s game a little bit where Ben can take a break from being the primary ball handler and creator and let those guys work a little bit and hopefully be able to mesh their games with the team more as the season goes on. The size of our team creates a lot of mismatches and Ben off ball cutting from the corner of people actually go out to him would help these guys play make some more.

These are just my thoughts on what I think I’d like to watch for and see as improvement this season.

What do you guys think about the Sixer’s so far. Are they real? Do they need these improvements to get past the second round? Make the finals? Win the finals? Or is this just early season kinks?",nbadiscussion
1874,879,Josh Jackson has the NBA's lowest OBPM at -4.7. Is it time for the Suns to worry about him?,"Given, he's 21, very physically gifted, and plays on a bad, non-fitting team. But if you're Phoenix, you might (and maybe should) be worried about how poorly your top pick from 2 years ago is playing offensively, while also grading negatively defensively, too with a -0.5 DBPM. I dont catch many Suns games, given that I'm an East coaster who mainly watches the Lakers and Nets. I haven't heard much positivity from anyone about Josh. Main complaints being that he looks ""lost"" and doesnt have the skills necessary to play the 2 or 4, this limiting his versatility.

I tried to make every trade as mutually-beneficial as possible, but as is the nature of NBA trade ideas, some of you will inevitably value players more or less than I do. My proposed trade ideas are ordered from most likely to least likely; let me know what you think and if you've had any other deadline trade ideas.

* **PHI receives Nikola Mirotic (expiring), Wesley Johnson (expiring)**

* **NOP receives Wilson Chandler (expiring), 2019 PHI 1st, 2019 PHI 2nd, Furkan Korkmaz (expiring)**

The Pelicans start their tank with a 1st round pick. The Sixers might have to give up more than this if a bidding war for Mirotic is underway, but I don't think there is a more logical plug-and-play trade in the NBA right now.


* **HOU receives JR Smith, David Nwaba (expiring)**

* **CLE receives Brandon Knight**

Brandon Knight has been one of the worst players in the NBA getting significant minutes this year and it's clear he is not 100% healthy. Cleveland has organized its contracts to all expire in the '19-'20 offseason, and Knight fits that plan while giving both he and JR Smith a chance to revive their careers in new cities. David Nwaba provides guard depth to a Houston team in desperate need of it.

* **SAC receives Enes Kanter (expiring), Emmanuel Mudiay (expiring)**

* **NYK receives Zach Randolph (expiring), Skal Labissiere, Ben McLemore (expiring), 2nd round picks in 2019, 2020**

New York is going to look nothing like it did even just 2 days ago after this deadline firesale. Kanter needs to go but his contract and public complaints surely have tanked his value entirely. Sacramento is the only logical landing spot money-wise, and they could use more competition at the back-up point guard slot, which Mudiay provides.

* **ATL receives Thon Maker, Jason Smith (expiring), 2020 MIL 2nd**

* **MIL receives Dewayne Dedmon (expiring)**

Milwaukee has been trading away a lot of its picks in recent years and they need to continue building without gutting their draft assets entirely. I think Dedmon is a really underrated player and he is a great back-up to Brook - he's a threat from 3, he's fairly mobile and he can crash the boards. Meanwhile Atlanta has a year and a half to see what they can get out of Thon Maker before ideally aiming to contend again.

* **TOR receives E’Twaun Moore**

* **NOP receives CJ Miles, 2019 TOR 2nd, 2020 TOR 2nd**

The New Orleans exodus continues. E’Twaun Moore is having a 2nd great year in a row shooting the ball while CJ Miles has fallen off a cliff. The two make similar money and Toronto’s 2nd this year is pretty worthless so the Raptors probably need to throw in another pick to make this upgrade happen.

* **IND receives Markieff Morris (expiring), 2019 ATL 2nd from WAS**

* **WAS receives Jerryd Bayless (expiring), 2019 MIA 2nd from MIN**

* **MIN receives Cory Joseph (expiring)**

Indiana surely still wants to make the playoffs, but rumors prior to Oladipo's injury were that the franchise wanted to trade a guard to find minutes for Aaron Holiday. Indiana can afford to part with Joseph to gain a high-2nd round pick this year. Markieff Morris may be done for the year based on his current recovery process for a neck injury, and the Wizards have said they won’t tank. Bayless gives them guard depth without giving up much, and Minnesota adds a better defender to their roster.

* **LAL receives Wesley Matthews (expiring), Kyle O’Quinn (expiring)**

* **NYK receives Caldwell-Pope (expiring), Michael Beasley (expiring), 2020 LAL 2nd**

* **IND receives Lance Stephenson (expiring), protected 2021 LAL 2nd **

The reunion trade, Lance goes to Indiana (again), Beasley goes back to New York (again). Indiana trades away another non-essential expiring contract in O’Quinn for a pick while the Lakers add better 3-pt shooting than what KCP offered and a better rebounding center than Tyson Chandler. I doubt the Lakers get AD this year so they may as well make some marginal upgrades.

* **SAS receives Trevor Ariza (expiring)**

* **WAS receives Jeremy Lin (expiring)**

* **ATL receives Pau Gasol, 2019 TOR 1st from SAS**

I think the likelihood of this one happening is pretty slim, but I’d sure like to see it. Washington needs to keep Beal and Satoransky healthy by curtailing their minutes, and like the previously-mentioned Bayless trade, they need guard depth badly. San Antonio could use a veteran like Ariza to hold down the wing, and Pau Gasol is not worth the money he’s making. In a weak 2019 draft 
Toronto’s 1st won’t be particularly valuable.

* **CHO receives Tristan Thompson, Rodney Hood (expiring-restricted)**

* **CLE receives Bismack Biyombo, Dwayne Bacon, Dragan Bender (expiring), 2019 CHO 1st (lottery protected in 2019, top-10 protected 2020, converts to 2nd in 2021)**

* **PHX receives Frank Kaminsky (expiring)**

Cody Zeller can’t seem to stay on the floor and Biyombo’s contract is obviously terrible. This is essentially a trade of Thompson for Biyombo and a late 1st with draft busts getting a new start a year early.


* **MEM receives Meyers Leonard, Caleb Swanigan, lottery-protected 2019 POR 1st (top-3 protected 2020)**

* **POR receives JaMychael Green (expiring), Shelvin Mack (expiring), Omri Casspi (expiring)**

Portland has to make some sort of move eventually if they’re going to keep Dame happy. This move isn’t huge but it certainly makes the Blazers a lot better this year while freeing up salary next year. JaMychal Green can be an excellent back-up for Aminu while Mack can play well alongside Seth Curry. Caleb Swanigan doesn’t seem like he’ll ever move the needle for Portland so it makes sense to let him go and see what Memphis can get out of him.

1878,883,'Super-Max': What Is It & Who's Next?,"In 2017, the NBA and the Player’s Association introduced many new changes to the league’s Collective Bargaining Agreement. One of the major highlights was the implementation of the Designated Rookie Extension, as well as the Designated Veteran Extension – the latter commonly known as the ‘super-max’. This article takes a look at each of these extensions: clarifying the specific details of what the extensions are, identifying who has signed them, and who may be eligible moving forward.

​

## Designated Rookie Extension

Teams have a strong advantage to retain players that have finished their rookie deal via their ability to offer longer, higher-paying contracts than outside teams. Instead of the standard four-year deal that a player can get in free-agency, players can re-sign with their own team with an additional fifth year on the deal. Teams can also offer their own players up to 8% raises (via Bird Rights) versus the standard 5% raises as a free agent.

However, teams are also permitted to designate up to two players in the final year of their rookie deal for a **Designated Rookie Extension**, which totals 6 years (including the remaining year on contract). The maximum salary for this extension is 25% of the cap and there are no performance requirements to qualify; the player simply has to be designated by the team (only one designated rookie can be acquired via trade). Thus far – Joel Embiid, Andrew Wiggins, and Devin Booker have inked this extension.

​

**Other names to watch this year:** Karl-Anthony Towns (Minnesota would reach their two designated rookie limit with Wiggins), Kristaps Porzingis

**Next Summer:** Ben Simmons, Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Jamal Murray

## 

## Designated Veteran Extension - ""Super-Max""

The **Designated Veteran Extension** has a maximum salary for 35% of the cap and is available to players that have 7-8 years of experience, 1-2 years remaining on their contract, and are still with the team that drafted them (or was traded on his rookie deal to another team). In addition to these requirements, the player must meet at least *one* of the following performance criteria to qualify:

* The player was named to the ***All-NBA First, Second, or Third team*** in the most recent season, or both of the two seasons that preceded the most recent season.
* The player was named ***Defensive Player of the Year*** in the most recent season, or both of the two seasons that preceded the most recent season.
* The player was named the ***NBA Most Valuable Player*** in any of the three most recent seasons.

Steph Curry, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and John Wall are the only four players that have signed the coveted 'super-max' thus far. Despite both signing contract extensions in the summer of 2016, Harden and Westbrook were grandfathered into eligibility for the extension beginning in 2017 once the revised CBA was released. The 35% maximum salary coupled with 8% Bird Right raises is the ultimate commitment that a team can make to a player and it has already presented interesting challenges for teams and ownership (also the player cannot be traded for one year after signing this extension). Certain stars can command this level of money with their talent, but filling out the rest of the roster can be difficult with so much money concentrated into one player. For a front office - it is all the more important to invest wisely, acknowledging the consequences of offering this extension and preparing for what it may look like on the back-end of the deal.

​

## Players on 'Super-Max' Watch

Next summer, ***Anthony Davis*** will be eligible for a record-setting $235 million extension. Davis automatically qualifies for the Designated Veteran Extension, no matter what occurs this season, since he was on an All-NBA team in 2016-2017 and 2017-2018. In order to turn down the inevitable super-max offer sheet or request a trade, Anthony Davis would need to have a strong desire to get out of New Orleans - just ask Kawhi Leonard how much he gave up. As players continue to acquire more and more leverage in contract negotiations, stars like Davis will be faced with the choice of exercising their freedom to play where they want, but at a steep financial cost. To better understand the costs of turning down the super-max; here is the super-max extension Anthony Davis will automatically be eligible for, the super max contract Kawhi was eligible for in San Antonio, and what Kawhi can now sign for in Toronto and in Free Agency.

​

Per the CBA, teams are only permitted to have two designated veterans on their roster. Having already given one of those slots to Steph Curry, the Golden State Warriors will not be able to extend the same offer to *both* ***Klay Thompson*** and ***Draymond Green***,should they each qualify.The Warriors escaped that conflict this summer since both Klay and Draymond failed to meet the qualifications. Klay was not voted to an All-NBA team this past season or in '16-'17 (he was in both '14-'15 and '15-'16) and Draymond does not currently meet the 'years of service' requirement (7-8 seasons). However, next summer, the Warriors could be in a difficult position should both players qualify and pursue this deal. With Draymond's age at the conclusion of current deal and Klay's reported desire to craft a team-friendly extension, the super-max may ultimately prove to be unlikely; however, each player's asking price could be high enough to where 'helping out the team' and ignoring their eligibility for the super-max isn't very appealing.

​

​

If he makes an All-NBA team this upcoming season, ***Damian Lillard*** will be eligible to sign the super-max extension in the summers of 2018 and 2019 (automatically qualifying that following year for making consecutive All-NBA's the preceding two seasons - as with Anthony Davis this summer). Signing the extension next summer would mean that the increased salary would be over four seasons, as Lillard would have two years remaining on his current deal (the Designated Player Extension has a six year maximum, including the years remaining on a player's current deal).

Damian Lillard is a relevant example because there are many similarities to his situation and that of DeMar DeRozan while he was in Toronto; face of the franchise for the last few years, court of public opinion seems to believe that their teams *appear* to have hit their ceilings, and both projected to be due for HUGE paydays down the road. Toronto certainly raised their [risk profile](https://www.thedreamshake.com/2017/6/13/15792650/daryl-morey-we-have-something-up-our-sleeve-houston-rockets) by bringing on Kawhi this year to replace DeRozan, but their management made a clear statement by moving on from their franchise player - they did *not* want to commit to him financially for the long-term. Portland will face similar questions to ask of Lillard if the team does not take a jump this year: commit to your player long-term for *big*money or try to move him for assets. In a weaker Eastern Conference, it is more than likely that DeRozan would have been remained eligible for the Designated Player Extension and it appears that the mechanism designed to help teams to retain their stars was one of the possible reasons Toronto decided to move on (similar situations have already occurred with Jimmy Butler in Chicago and DeMarcus Cousins in Sacramento).

​

**Other names to watch for** **eligibility:** Giannis Antetokounmpo, Bradley Beal, CJ McCollum, Rudy Gobert, Kemba Walker\*

\**Not each of these player's may be the typical candidate for a super-max deal - however,* if eligible - their earning potential increases greatly and the player may have more leverage in contract negotiations as we discussed with Draymond and Klay.

​

## Other MISC Notes:

* **Chris Paul** and **LeBron James** both signed max deals this summer. Since they each played more than 10 seasons, they were both eligible for a 35% maximum salary. Each signed 4 year deals at that value, with Paul retaining his 8% Bird Right raises (since he was traded from LAC) and James signing with the standard 5% raises.

* Other CBA note: LeBron does not have a no-trade clause on his contract with the Lakers. To qualify, a player has to have been in the NBA for at least eight seasons and have played for the team with which he is signing for at least four seasons.
* If he opts out of his final year with Golden State and enters free agency, **Kevin Durant** will be eligible for the same max contracts as Chris Paul and LeBron since he has also been in the league for 10+ seasons (35% of the cap - no Bird Rights \*outside of GS\*).

Understandably when I saw the clip of the reporter asking KD about a Sonics resurrection last night, I was pretty amped up.

1881,886,Who has had the most disappointing season on your team?,"Who did not make a development you expected? Who regressed hard? Who was just an overall minus on the court, when you could expect more from him before the season? 

&#x200B;

For the Raptors: 

**Jeremy Lin** has not been playing well at all, since he came here. I didn't expect much from him after we picked him up at the buyout market, but I also wasn't prepared for that kind of disappointment. 21.6% from 3, 38.6% from the field, -4.1 BPM (which is actually pretty hard considering how well the entire team has been playing), -0.2 VORP. He has looked a bit better in the last game, but still very likely will have no role in our playoff rotation. 

Also, **OG Anunoby** has not really developed the way one could have expected. I don't want to be too hard on him because he was better than expected last year and had a lot of personal issues this season, but both his shooting numbers and his advanced stats are worse than they were in his Rookie season. I'm pretty sure that he'll be able to pick things up next year, but, this season he hasn't been as good as I had hoped.  

For the guys that left us during the season, **CJ Miles** has obviously had a horrible shooting slump (31.4% from 3, which is his worst performance since 2012), but he looked close to coming back to his form when we traded him. **Malachi Richardson** was also pretty disappointing, he was probably the only deep bench guy who showed absolutely no reason why he should be on a NBA team. The fact that he was drafted over Siakam still fascinates me. ",nbadiscussion
1882,887,Predict the Christmas Day slate for 2020,"I thought it would be fun to predict next year's Christmas slate

There are some teams that I think are virtual guarantees to play on Christmas next year (barring a surprise retirement or death).

Los Angeles Lakers - Why? The most popular athlete in the anglosphere (LeBron), arguably the most popular non soccer team on Earth, Anthony Davis, most likely a title contender

Los Angeles Clippers - Why? Richest owner in sports, title contender, Kawhi Leonard

Golden State Warriors - Why? Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, championship pedigree, big market. I know they are a disappointment this year but Steph is probably the second most popular basketball player in America, he'll be scheduled for Christmas.

Brooklyn Nets - why? they play in the capital of western civilization, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, title contender It's pretty shocking that no New York team is playing this year (it's a good thing but it's still shocking). Next year that won't be the case.

Boston Celtics - historic franchise, conference title contender, big market

Milwaukee Bucks - Giannis, title contender, probably will have a deep playoff run this year.

Dallas Mavericks - Luka. That's basically the only reason. They're a good team but without him they won't have a chance at Christmas. Though it is a big market

Philadelphia 76ers - Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, conference/title contender. Big market helps.

That is eight teams, so two more are needed. I have a few contenders

Miami Heat

Why? Very solid team, place in a place players want to go in December 

Why not? No superstar players, not a huge market in terms of population

Denver Nuggets

Why? Great team, Jokic is pretty popular (not quite a superstar though)

Why Not? Small fanbase - Denver just doesn't have an NBA culture, they are virtually no fans outside of Denver

New Orleans Pelicans

Why? Zion. He's the reason they were scheduled this year. 

Why not? The NBA might be concerned about Zion's availability. Very small market. 

Houston Rockets

Why? James Harden, Westbrook, big market

Why not? They might blow it up if they don't win the west this season

Indiana Pacers

Why? Very good, solid squad. Should be an eastern conference contender

Why Not? Small market, not a large fanbase, seen as a ""boring"" team

Toronto Raptors

Why? Great organization so should be in the eastern conference hunt

Why Not? Because they play in Canada

Knicks and Bulls are theoretical options due to their market size but, unless they get a surprise free agent, they wouldn't be rewarded.

With that being said, here is my predictions

MIL at MIA - Milwaukee doesn't seem to host Christmas day games for whatever reason. I'm sure they wouldn't mind a trip to Miami in December. Throw a bone one of the faces of your league. This would most likely be on ESPN.

BOS at BKN - The Knicks used to always host Christmas games until they got so pathetic that the NBA wouldn't allow the most valuable NBA franchise in the most important city outside of East Asia to host games. The NBA will love to host in Brooklyn. Boston and New York is a rivalry older than the US itself.  This would most likely be on ABC.

PHI at DAL - Central timezone should get a game and Mark Cuban is one of the NBA's favorite owners. Luka vs Embiid would be a great way to show the international spread and appeal that the future most popular sport on Earth has. This would probably be an ABC game.

LAL at GSW - LeBron and Steph Curry. The two most popular NBA players and if Tom Brady retires, the two most popular athletes in the USA. This would certainly be an ABC game. 

NOP at LAC - You might think the Lakers would get preference over the Clippers in hosting, but with Steve Ballmer owning the Clippers, the league bows to the Clippers. I do think the league will schedule the Pelicans again because, simply put, Zion is the future American face of the league. He's incredibly popular. I think if he comes back this season, he'll have some highlight plays and people will remember that he's more popular in American than Luka or Giannis (sadly).

What do you guys think? Which teams are locks? Any teams I omitted that you think could be on the slate (I feel like Houston has the best chance of any team I omitted followed by Denver)",nbadiscussion

1886,891,What's the deal with the Pacers?,"Currently, the Indiana Pacers are third in the East with the number one defense, number one scoring defense while having a below average offense despite despite being fifth in the league for 3 point percentage on the third most attempts per game. They have the fifth best record in the league over much more discussed East teams like the Sixers or Celtics, and every Western Conference team sans Warriors and Nuggets. How come we don’t talk about them like we do with those those teams? Do they not deserve our respect? Let’s find out! 
	
You know during the finals the past couple of years, Lebron or Kyrie or someone would yell or scowl at another player on the team and you would sit at home thinking “Wow, does Lebron even like anyone on this team?” Well, you have the opposite reaction while watching this Pacers team, if someone gets beat off the dribble everyone acts like they have to make sure the opponent doesn’t get to the hole so that whichever defender doesn’t look bad. It’s like what every front office hopes for, an actual family working together. Studying them over the past month has made me very jealous of Pacers fans but getting too close to any competitive  Eastern conference team is like befriending a pig you know will be slaughtered for its bacon. The western conference team that wins the WCF (the Warriors) will most likely murder whatever team makes it out of the East, so we should try not to high hopes for any of these teams. Maybe that’s answer for why the Pacers are seemingly generally ignored when talking about the teams that could make it out of the East. Fans ignoring their games are missing out on some excellent fundamental basketball. Every player cuts, tries hard on defense, and doesn’t wait around for their star to iso or get the motion started. They communicate on switches quickly so that no assignment is missed. 
	
One thing I want to mention is how they got to where they are now. They’ve only had one draft pick in the top ten in the entire 21st-century, which was the tenth pick used on Paul George, an obvious home-run. They also didn’t construct their current roster around one player with other players traded for or signed in order to play of that player’s flaws and strengths. In the 2017 free agency, most people thought the Pacers were signing random players that all together would compete for the number one pick, not a top playoff spot. The Front office took risks in trades and signings clearly believing that they would get the best out of these players. What they got was a team that had players all with a certain role, which each player excels at, let’s look at these players to show what I mean. 

**Darren Collison**: Despite a drop-off in efficacy and scoring from last year, his job is to set other guys up and run the offense with Oladipo which he does quite well with scoring bouts every now and then. He was the leader in AST - TO ratio last year and is currently sixth this year with 5.7 per game, despite never being in the top 20 in AST-TO any year before playing in Indiana. He scores 9.7 points per game on mostly partially open shots. He’s not a bad player for the fifth worst in your starting lineup but last year, he led the league in three point percentage with 12 points per game with elite shooting splits of 49/46/88 so hopefully he can pick up the efficacy post-all star break. 

**Bojan Bogdananvic**: Someone replied the WOJ tweet that announced the Pacers signed him by saying: “We just signed a bag of dicks.” He was generally thought of as someone who can heat up every now and then but that was all he offer. Now, no-one has an opinion on him because he’s on the Pacers but he has been arguably the most important part of the Pacers offense due to Oladipo’s struggles. He’s averaging 16 points (career high) on a 61.4 TS% (was never in the 60s before this season), good for 21st in the league and tied with Tobias Harris. While he might not contribute a ton of rebounds and assists, he is a huge rease why they have the second best defense in the league. No single defender gave more trouble to LeBron last post-season. He is smart, strong, and (like all of the Pacers) tries his hardest. He improves on both ends of the floor every season. 

**Sabonis**: Only 22 and third in True shooting with a percentage 66.4% (a hair ahead of Steph Curry) off 15 points per game and just shy of ten boards a game with almost three assists. 97% of his shots come from two-point land, but is shooting a whooping 77% on the few thress he has taken. All this while coming off the bench. Although every conversation about Sabonis is how good he is at scoring, his rebounding and passing could be something truly special with a couple of year and couple of more minutes per game. He’s another player that probably won’t make an all-defense team in his career but is not a barnyard door either. No-one on the Pacers is. He is quick and long enough to protect the rim from those who want to drive. 

**Myles Turner**: Also only 22 and everyone knows that he is a good defender but he is above where people rank him, he is a top-3 DPOY candidate already. He’s first in blocks and first in blocks-to-foul ratio. The Pacers have the best defense in the league but during the stretch of games without Myles they slide all the way down to 27th! On the offensive end, he scores 12.9 points per game on 50/38/68. People keep expecting him to make that leap into an elite scorer and defender but he just improves a little each year offensively, he scores well enough inside, can catch lobs, and if you sag off him he will hit the open three. 

I didn’t want to talk about Oladipo but rather comment on how all these role players but let’s look at their star and how far this team can go. Last year, Oladipo was the Most Improved Player who seemed on the verge of superstardom but has taken a step back this year. He is currently averaging 19.2 on 42/34/73, a True Shooting percentage of 51.9%. Even last year, he wasn’t the most efficient but his impact was based off all that he could do: defend at a high level (led the league in steals), terrific athlete, good enough shooter who can dish and run a top-ten offense as well. His assists are up from last year (from 4.3 to 5.2) but he has not been the guy people thought he would be this year. Should he be an all star? Yes. There’s no question. Best player on the fifth best team in the league with almost 20/5/5 with good defense. Is he good enough to be the best player on a contending team? I’m not sure. 

While his numbers are all-star level, they are that of a superstar. Can a contending team compete with one all-star and a bunch of excellent role-players? What other top team has only one all-star? Of the top 8, all have either multiple all-stars or a clear superstar/MVP level player. (in one team’s case an MVP candidate, possibly the greatest scorer of all time, with a top ten player coming off the bench but I’ll talk about Giannis, Middleton, and Brogdon in another article). 

I don’t want to speculate as to superstars to sign, they would greatly benefit from one superstar. They have a lot of cap space but I don’t see why they wouldn’t want to re-sign this core, maybe try for a Conley trade, re-sign all the role players, and convince one superstar to more to Indiana. Durant, people would respect the hell out of you if you can bring a ring to this Indiana team. I’m not sure about this team’s future but I love how they got to wear they are by having multiple high-caliber role players who complete their task. Collison protects the ball and get guys involved. Turner turns them into the best defensive team. Sabonis comes off the bench and gets buckets over the other team's’ bench players with superstar efficiency. While individually none of them are superstars, when they come together they are (in a way) a superteam.

1887,892,"The ""usage rate"" statistic: do you have an intuitive understanding of what it means?","If you think you do then you're possibly wrong about it, like me.            
**Usage rate** - the percent of plays ended with the player either shooting the ball, turning the ball over or getting to the free-throw line.  
                
I feel like in online discussions this statistic is often used as if it represents the proportion of time during which the player *controls* the ball. At least that's what it looks like to somebody who hasn't read the formal definition.                
     
If a player dribbles the ball for 20 seconds then kicks it out for a shot, this possession *wouldn't show up* in his usage rate.              

For completeness, this season's [usage rate stats](https://stats.nba.com/players/usage/).             
Examples: Klay Thompson has almost the same usage rate as Steph and KD (26.2 vs 29.3, 30.5). Kyle Kuzma has an almost 50% bigger usage rate than Lonzo Ball (23.1 vs 16.2).",nbadiscussion

1889,894,Harden and the Hand-checking Era,"I often hear people say that Harden is helped by the current rules, particularly the lack of handchecking. And, offensively, I agree it is easier for every player to score without dealing with handchecking, Harden included. 

However, one of Harden's primary attributes is how unusually strong he is for a perimeter player. Thus, *relative to other perimeter players*, I think he would be affected less by hand-checking than most perimeter scorers. 

But the primary reason I think Harden would be better in the handchecking era has to do with one of his biggest areas of weakness: his perimeter defense. Harden is, flatly, a bad perimeter defender. He's good in the post. He's good at playing passing lanes and stripping the ball. But he is terrible at on ball perimeter defense. 

In the handchecking era though, I think Harden would have been a much better defender. Again, Harden is exceptionally strong for a perimeter player. If he was allowed to hand check, he could utilize his strength on perimeter defense, something he really can't do in today's rules. And, given his strength (especially his hand and arm strength), as well as his ability to poke the ball loose, I think he would have been a very effective hand-checker. 

So, while I agree that Harden's job as scorer is made easier since handchecking isn't allowed, I think his exceptional strength for a perimeter player makes him, relatively speaking, less helped by it than other scorers, and that, if handchecking was allowed, he'd be a much more passable defensive player.",nbadiscussion

1892,897,"[OC] Boston's trade assets have been highly vaunted, but how valuable are they? A closer look.","With Anthony Davis requesting a trade, now more than ever we are discussing the kind of assets Boston can send to New Orleans to bring The Brow to TD Garden. There is merit, though, to taking a bit of a deeper look at the players and picks Boston has in their trade arsenal, some of which will undoubtedly be in the package Danny Ainge will offer to Dell Demps and the Pelicans come this summer, provided he is not dealt to the Lakers before the trade deadline. 

That being said, let's first take a look at the players Boston has to offer, and take a brief look at how well they've been doing this year. (S) denotes starter, (B) denotes bench. 

|**Name**|**Age**|**Position**|**Points**|**Rebounds**|**Assists**|**Shooting Splits**|**USG%**|**TS%**|**NETRTG**|
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Jayson Tatum|20|SF (S)|16.2|6.2|1.8|44.8 FG%, 38.1 3P%, 85.5 FT%|21.8%|55.2%|8.6|
|Jaylen Brown|22|SG (B)|12.3|4.2|1.3|44.8 FG%, 33.1 3P%, 67.7 FT%|21.1%|53.3%|2.8|
|Terry Rozier|24|PG (B)|8.6|4.0|2.8|38.0 FG%, 34.8 3P%, 79.7 FT%|17.5%|49.2%|0.5|
|Marcus Smart|24|SG (S)|7.9|2.8|3.9|40.8 FG%, 36.5 3P%, 78.6 FT%|13.6%|56.2%|7.9|
|Marcus Morris|29|PF (S)|14.6|6.1|1.4|47.5 FG%, 41.9 3P%, 86.8 FT%|20.3%|60.8%|6.9|

From this, we can draw a few conclusions and acknowledge some interesting things:

1. Marcus Morris is having a career year, averaging a career high in points, rebounds, FT%, and 3P% (this marks the first year he has shot above 40% from 3). He also has a team-high TS% (not counting the 74.9% TS of Robert Williams III, as he has not been averaging double digit minutes. Kyrie Irving is a close second, with a TS% of 60.3%), and has overall been playing the most efficient basketball of his career. Many teams would love to have a PF with the efficiency and outside shooting ability of Morris, as he is able to space the floor well.

2. Terry Rozier and Jaylen Brown have underperformed, but this is mainly due to Brown's injury problems, and after undergoing medical procedures he has elevated his level of play. Brown continues to remain a promising young prospect, and his resume from Boston's 2018 playoffs run will more than likely elevate his value in the eyes of teams like New Orleans that are looking for talented players that can perform in the post-season. Rozier continues to perform well as a starter in the absence of Kyrie Irving, but he has not been very good off the bench. Any team looking to trade for Rozier will likely have to start him to allow him to perform at a high level. Again, he is still young (at 24), and as such he has time to continue developing. 

3. Jayson Tatum has been in a bit of a slump, but continues to post above league average FG%, 3P%, FT% and TS%. He has been a standout player from his draft class, and has had more post-season success than rival sophomore stars like Donovan Mitchell, De'Aaron Fox, Lauri Markannen, Kyle Kuzma, and John Collins. Tatum is the most valuable trade asset player Boston has, and perhaps even the best young asset any team is willing to part with for AD, and as such, they will understandably be reluctant to trade him unless Davis commits to re-signing with Boston.

4. Marcus Smart has emerged as one of Boston's best defensive players, having a bigger impact than the stat-sheet suggests. His move to the starting lineup has been big for him, and he is a good, young asset that has some scoring ability and is primarily a defensive minded player. He will be a good piece in any trade offers, and at 24, still has room and time for improvement on offense. 

More so acknowledged than the players, however, are Boston's draft pick assets. However, it isn't so simple as ""Boston has 4 first round picks in the 2019 draft"", as each have different rules and protections. I am going to use tankathon.com to predict draft order (based on the current records), and it should give a good idea as to where these picks will end up based on the protections, and how teams are performing at this moment.

|**Pick**|**Protection**|**Current projected position**|**Likely to convey this year?**|
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Boston Celtics|N/A (Own pick)|23|Yes|
|Los Angeles Clippers|Lottery protected|18|Maybe|
|Memphis Grizzlies|Top 8 protected|6|No|
|Sacramento Kings|Top 1 protected|13|Yes|
|*Conditional:*Philadelphia 76ers|To Boston if it is higher than SAC pick|25|No|

A bit of further explanation:

1. The 76ers pick (as a result of the Markelle Fultz trade) will head to Boston if it is higher than the Kings pick, but given the Kings position in a tough western conference and the 76ers current performance, it is almost 100% guaranteed that Boston will have the Kings pick. The flip-side is, however, Boston was expecting a top-5 pick from the Kings (just not #1 overall), and thanks to Sacramento's excellent performance the first half of the season, combined with a draft regarded as very top-heavy, a pick likely to end up in the early to late 10s may not have as much value as Boston was anticipating. 

2. The Grizzlies pick is top 8 protected, and with Memphis's start to the season Boston was likely excited to get a pick that would convey. However, with their latest struggles and rumors of Mike Conley and Marc Gasol being on the trading block, Memphis will likely tank the rest of the season and as such due to the protections (the pick is projected at #6 currently) Boston will likely not get this pick. Next year, the pick becomes top 6 protected, and if Memphis were to tank a consecutive year and get a top 6 pick, the pick becomes unprotected and conveys regardless in 2021. 

3. The Clippers pick is honestly a question mark at this point. While LAC is out of the lottery now, they have not been performing well as of late, and will likely not make the playoffs if the Lakers go on a big run with the return of James (and maybe with Davis, nobody knows). If LA is able to stay out of the lottery as they wish to, then the Celtics get the pick. If they slip deeply in the tail-end of the season and end up at the very bottom of the lottery, the pick will not convey. The pick is also lottery protected in 2020, so if they end up in the lottery once more that pick does not convey and instead they will convey their 2022 second round pick to Boston. 

Boston has some great young talented players, and valuable draft assets on paper, but those draft assets in reality may have lesser worth than many fans and pundits may think, and some of those players have been struggling as well. The remainder of this season and the post-season will be very important, as some of those trade pieces will have to show their worth. While Boston can still put together a very convincing trade package centered around Jayson Tatum, there are still questions as to whether a team like New Orleans will bite on draft picks that have some questions around them currently. Then again, things may be different by the end of the season, so there is no telling.

1896,901,Creating a Lebron Team Equivalent Talent Wise to an MJ Bulls Team (than debating GOAT),"I am watching the Jordan doc and he had incredible teammates assembled alongside of him. Lebron had terrible teams around him until he went to Miami and they still weren't a perfect compliment to his skill sets... So, with some help, I was hoping we could assemble a Lebron led team (or 2 teams one resembling the first 3 peat and the second 3 peat) that would be equivalent talent wise to Jordan's bulls... Couple notes: I am taking players from that generation and replacing them with more contemporary players. Obviously there's more of an emphasis on shooting now so I loosely pairing people based on talent but trying to think how teammates complimented Jordon and trying to find players who were around the same talent level and seeing how they would compliment Bron.... I am open to new suggestions.

Start with Scottie -- DPOY, great passer, the perfect number two for Jordan... Who would that be for Lebron? I was looking on the greatest players of all time ([https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/29105681/ranking-top-74-nba-players-all-nos-40-11](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29105681/ranking-top-74-nba-players-all-nos-40-11)) and number 21 was Pippen and 20 was Garnett... Garnett was an incredible defender, great shooter, great team player/teammate.. Garnett would the PERFECT number 2 to Lebron. So let's imagine if Lebron's prime years and Garnetts prime years overlapped precisely (like Jordan's and Pippens)... Open to other ideas if Garnett isn't perfect... (Edit: I think a healthy and PEAK Paul George is a fine replacement) 

**First Three Peat --**

Pippen ----> Garnett (or PG13)

Horrace Grant (Prime) ---> Shawn Marion (Not set on this) 

John Paxton ---> Joe Harris (Changed from Reddick or Korver) 


BJ Armstrong ---> Derek Fisher — Changed from Mike Conley? (IDK)

Bill Cartwright ---> Cody Zeller 

**Second Three Peat --**

Pippen ----> Garnett (or PG13)

Dennis Rodman -- Draymond Green?

Stever Kerr -- Kyle Korver or JJ Reddick

Harper ——> Patrick Beverly 

Toni Kukoc --  Prime Channing Fry? (Changed from Manu?) 

Luc Longley -- Robin Lopez?

Note these comps are more about talent comparison and also fit next to star. 

So now I am trying to imagine Lebron getting to play with this cast and crew of players. Lebron, Garnett pick and roll would be insane, with even just 2 shooters around him would be unstoppable. And on defense they would be insane, long and switchable... Could be the same PG13 just obviously different in some ways. 

Either of these teams would of been incredible. His assists would be up. His efficiency would be up. He would won 4-8 championships.

THOUGHTS? HELP? -- Note: suck it hatters. It's really hard to do this cause there are so many factors, I am def not a 90s bulls expert so I would love some help. I think it's a worthy thought experiment cause if we ever compare the two, the context of teammates/ team is extremely important.

1897,902,"How ""scalable"" is Luka Doncic? Is his game more predicated to being a floor raiser than a ceiling raiser?","I've been watching and listening to some of Ben Taylor's ""Thinking Basketball"" and recently he posted an interesting video on Kobe's scalability in the playoffs versus Wade and Harden. Due to Kobe's incredibly diverse offensive arsenal he was able to overcome various looks on defense and Taylor shows that Kobe's box +/- actually improved in the playoffs versus the regular season in 2008, in contrast to Harden who's numbers depreciated in the playoffs versus the regular season.

Without going into too much detail on that video, it got me thinking about one of my favorite players to watch this year: Luka. Whatever expectations he had going intuitive year 2 after his ROY campaign, it's clear he's surpassed them and positioned himself as a strong case for being considered a top 5 player in the league already.  I love watching Luka play and seeing what could maybe be one of the greatest players of all time in his early years is exciting.

However I do wonder if Lukas otherworldly sophomore campaign is helped by the fact that Rick Carlisle lets him be the entire offense when he's on the floor. What Luka does in his role is incredibly difficult and impressive - I'm willing to garner only a few players in his role can do what he does give or take - Giannis, Lebron, Harden etc so this isn't meant to take away from what he's doing. But I wonder if this current setup the Mavs have of Luka being the one man offense is the best way to cater to his skill set - and if it puts a ceiling on him.

Does Luka need to be the heliocentric universe of whatever offense he's on to be as good as he is? Would his game scale better or worse than other top players right now in various other offensive situations?  Part of me wonders if having the entire offense run through Luka puts a floor on how good they can be, especially when defense gets more physical and clamps are brought out in the playoffs. It feels like if Luka can't get his step back going or get his defender behind him on the pick and roll he gets forced to dump the ball out.  When everything is working, his step back is falling and his high pick and roll is working everything clicks into place. His shooting forces the defender to play up on him which opens his drive which opens his floater/tough layup/lob/skip pass game but when one of these factors isn't working it feels like it negatively impacts Luka harder than another player.

1898,903,30 NBA All-Time Teams in 30 Days: All-Time Miami Heat (24/30),"I'm back with another All-Time team with the All-Time Miami Heat. Rules are as usual; 2-4 players at each position, players are included based on their tenure with the team, and I can move players out of position if I feel that's what's best for the team but I can only move them one position up or down. I don't do this a majority of the time, but I do have cases where I move a few players around. Anyways, onto the All-Time Heat squad.

**PG1: Tim Hardaway (1996-01)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 1st Team, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 17.3 PPG, 3.2 RPG, 7.8 APG, 1.5 SPG, 0.1 BPG

Tim Hardaway was a really good point guard during his five-and-a-half years with the Miami Heat. Hardaway was acquired by the Heat during the 1995-96 season from the Warriors, and he averaged 17.2 PPG, 3.5 RPG, 10 APG, and 2.1 SPG in 28 games for them that season. However, his first full season in South Beach would be a big one for Hardaway as he averaged 20.3 PPG, 3.4 RPG, and 8.6 APG while helping the Heat reach the Eastern Conference Finals en route to an All-NBA 1st Team selection that season. Hardaway would continue to be one of the NBA’s best point guards over the next two seasons as he averaged 18.3 PPG, 3.5 RPG, and 7.9 APG during that span while making the All-NBA 2nd Team. However, age was starting to get to Hardaway, and he averaged 14.3 PPG and 6.7 APG in his final two seasons in Miami before being traded to the Dallas Mavericks during the 2001 offseason.

&#x200B;

**PG2: Goran Dragic (2015-)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star

Stats: 16.7 PPG, 3.8 RPG, 5.4 APG, 1 SPG, 0.2 BPG

Goran Dragic has been a very good point guard during his four-and-a-half-year stint with the Miami Heat so far. Acquired by the Heat during the 2015 trade deadline, Dragic was solid in his 26 games for them that season as he averaged 16.6 PPG, 3.4 RPG, and 5.3 APG. After averaging 14.1 PPG, 3.8 RPG, and 5.8 APG in his first full season with the Heat, Dragic improved in the 2016-17 season as he averaged 20.3 PPG, 3.8 RPG, and 5.8 APG. Although Dragic’s stats fell off a bit in the next season as he averaged 17.3 PPG, 4.1 RPG, and 4.8 APG, he was able to make his first All-Star team that season. Dragic only played in 36 games this past season due to a knee injury, but he looks to bounce back for the upcoming season with Jimmy Butler joining the Heat this offseason.

&#x200B;

**SG1: Dwyane Wade (2003-16, 2018-19)**

Accolades w/Team: 5 Finals Appearances, 3x NBA Champion, 1x Finals MVP, 13x All-Star, 2010 All-Star Game MVP, 2x All-NBA 1st Team, 3x All-NBA 2nd Team, 3x All-NBA 3rd Team, 3x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 22.7 PPG, 4.7 RPG, 5.6 APG, 1.6 SPG, 0.9 BPG

Dwyane Wade is the greatest player in Miami Heat history as he had an excellent 15-year stint with the franchise. Drafted fifth overall by the Miami Heat in the 2003 NBA Draft, Wade was good in his rookie season as he averaged 16.2 PPG, 4 RPG, and 4.5 APG, but he had a huge second season, paired with Shaq, as he averaged 24.1 PPG, 5.2 RPG, and 6.8 APG while making the All-NBA 2nd Team. Wade took over the alpha dog role for the franchise in his third season as he averaged 27.2 PPG, 5.7 RPG, 6.7 APG, and 1.9 SPG while also helping the Heat win an NBA championship as he won Finals MVP by averaging 34.7 PPG and 7.8 RPG in six games against the Dallas Mavericks. Wade would still be an All-Star, although marred by injuries, in the next two seasons, but Wade was stellar in the 2008-09 season as he averaged 30.2 PPG, 5 RPG, 7.5 APG, 2.2 SPG, and 1.3 BPG while making the All-NBA 1st Team for the first time. That would be Wade’s best season, but he was still an All-Star in each of the next seven seasons, even with LeBron James and Chris Bosh, as he averaged 22.3 PPG, 4.8 RPG, 5 APG, and 1.5 SPG during that span while helping the Heat win two more championships. Although Wade left in free agency to the Bulls in the 2016 offseason, he’d return to the Heat in the 2018 trade deadline. Wade had his farewell season this past season as he averaged 15 PPG in that season before retiring.

&#x200B;

**SG2: Eddie Jones (2000-05, 2007)**

Stats: 16 PPG, 4.5 RPG, 3 APG, 1.3 SPG, 0.6 BPG

After having an All-NBA season with the Hornets in the 1999-00 season, Jones was traded to the Miami Heat during the 2000 offseason. Jones was a very good shooting guard, and he averaged 17.8 PPG, 4.4 RPG, 3.2 APG, and 1.4 SPG during his first four seasons with the franchise even though he never made the All-Star team in that span. However, Jones averaged just 12.7 PPG, 5.1 RPG, and 2.7 APG during his fifth season as his scoring role diminished due to the acquisition of Shaq and the rise of Dwyane Wade. Jones was traded to the Grizzlies during the 2005 offseason, but he returned to the Heat during the 2006-07 season although he averaged just 9.5 PPG in 35 games.

&#x200B;

**SF1: LeBron James (2010-14)**

Accolades w/Team: 4 Finals Appearances, 2x NBA Champion, 2x Finals MVP, 2x NBA MVP, 4x All-Star, 4x All-NBA 1st Team, 3x All-Defensive 1st Team, 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 26.9 PPG, 7.6 RPG, 6.7 APG, 1.7 SPG, 0.7 BPG

Even though LeBron James only played four seasons with the Miami Heat, they were arguably the best seasons of his NBA career. James ""took his talents to South Beach"" during the 2010 season and was really good in his first season with them as he averaged 26.7 PPG, 7.5 RPG, and 7 APG while making the All-NBA 1st Team and helping the Heat reach the Finals that season. Even though James had a mediocre NBA Finals performance that year against the Mavericks, he bounced back in each of his next two seasons as he averaged 26.9 PPG, 8 RPG, 6.8 APG, and 1.8 SPG during that span. Not only that, but he won an MVP in each of those two seasons, but he helped the Heat win an NBA championship in both of those seasons as he averaged 28.1 PPG, 9.1 RPG, 6.1 APG, and 1.8 APG during both the 2012 and 2013 postseason runs combined. James was still phenomenal in the 2013-14 season as he averaged 27.1 PPG, 6.9 RPG, and 6.3 APG en route to another All-NBA 1st Team selection. However, the Heat lost to the Spurs in five games in the 2014 NBA Finals, and the King returned home to Cleveland during the 2014 offseason.

&#x200B;

**SF2: Glen Rice (1989-95)**

Stats: 19.3 PPG, 4.9 RPG, 2.2 APG, 1.2 SPG, 0.3 BPG

Drafted fourth overall by the Miami Heat in the 1989 NBA Draft, Glen Rice was a very good player and excellent sharpshooter during his six seasons with the franchise. Rice was a solid player as he averaged 15.5 PPG and 4.8 RPG during his first two seasons. However, Rice emerged as one of the NBA’s elite three-point shooters over the next four seasons as he averaged 21.2 PPG and 5 RPG during that span while shooting 39.3% from three-point range on 4.9 attempts per game during those four seasons despite not making an All-Star team in any of those seasons. Even with Rice’s excellent shooting ability, the Heat traded him to the Hornets before the 1995-96 season for All-Star center Alonzo Mourning.

&#x200B;

**SF3: Jamal Mashburn (1997-00)**

Stats: 15.8 PPG, 5.2 RPG, 3.4 APG, 1 SPG, 0.2 BPG

Jamal Mashburn was a solid player on the Miami Heat during the late 1990s when they were Eastern Conference contenders. Mashburn arrived in South Beach during the 1997 trade deadline and averaged 13.4 PPG, 5.6 RPG, and 3.5 APG in 32 games that season. Although Mashburn missed a total of 50 games over the next two seasons due to injury, he improved during that span compared to his first half-season as he averaged 15 PPG, 5.3 RPG, and 2.9 APG during those two seasons. Mashburn played a full season again in the 1999-00 season as he had his best season in Miami and averaged 17.5 PPG, 5 RPG, and 3.9 APG. However, Mashburn was traded to the Hornets during the 2000 offseason in the deal that sent Eddie Jones to the Heat.

&#x200B;

**PF1: Chris Bosh (2010-16)**

Accolades w/Team: 4 Finals Appearances, 2x NBA Champion, 6x All-Star

Stats: 18 PPG, 7.3 RPG, 1.8 APG, 0.9 SPG, 0.9 BPG

After five All-Star selections with the Toronto Raptors, Chris Bosh signed with the Miami Heat, along with LeBron, during the 2010 offseason. During his four seasons with both James and Wade, Bosh was a really good third option as he averaged 17.3 PPG and 7.4 RPG during that span while making the All-Star team both times and helping the Heat win two NBA championships. After LeBron returned to Cleveland during the 2014 offseason, and Bosh saw an increase in production in the season after that as he averaged 21.1 PPG and 7 RPG before a blood clot ended his 2014-15 season after 44 games. The next season, Bosh averaged 19.1 PPG and 7.4 RPG with yet another All-Star selection before another blood clot ended his 2015-16 season after 53 games. Sadly, those blood clots would be career-ending for Bosh, but he was still important to the Heat’s big three during their championship run.

&#x200B;

**PF2: Udonis Haslem (2003-)**

Accolades w/Team: 5 Finals Appearances, 3x NBA Champion

Stats: 7.6 PPG, 6.7 RPG, 0.9 APG, 0.5 SPG, 0.3 BPG

Despite being signed as an undrafted free agent by the Heat in 2003, Udonis Haslem has played in 16 seasons with the franchise so far. Haslem was solid in his rookie year as he averaged 7.3 PPG and 6.3 RPG. After that rookie season, Haslem was a key piece of the Heat rotation over the next seven seasons as he averaged 10.5 PPG and 8.4 RPG during that span. However, a torn ligament shortened Udonis Haslem’s 2010-11 season to 13 games, and he was never the same player after that. He has played in each of the eight last seasons, although he only averaged 3.8 PPG and 4.5 RPG. Haslem is a great veteran presence in the locker room, so he’s on the Heat roster still despite only playing in 40 games over the last three seasons.

&#x200B;

**PF3: P.J. Brown (1996-00)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 9.9 PPG, 7.9 RPG, 1.4 APG, 0.9 SPG, 1.1 BPG

P.J. Brown signed with the Miami Heat during the 1996 offseason and was a key member of the franchise for four years when they were contending during the late 1990s. As the starting power forward on those teams, Brown was solid while averaging 9.9 PPG and 7.9 RPG. He wasn’t much offensively, but his defense was really good as he made two All-Defensive teams in four seasons with the team. During the 2000 offseason, Brown was traded to the Charlotte Hornets with Jamal Mashburn in the deal that sent Eddie Jones to Miami.

&#x200B;

**PF4: Grant Long (1988-94)**

Stats: 11.6 PPG, 7 RPG, 2.1 APG, 1.4 SPG, 0.5 BPG

Grant Long was a solid player in a little over six seasons with the Miami Heat. Despite being drafted in the second round in the 1988 NBA Draft, Long had a solid rookie year as he averaged 11.9 PPG and 6.7 RPG. After his stats decreased to 8.8 PPG and 6 RPG during the next two seasons, the two seasons after that were better as he averaged 14.4 PPG and 8 RPG during that span. After playing one more season with the Heat while averaging 11.4 PPG and 7.2 RPG, Long was traded to the Atlanta Hawks two games into the following 1994-95 season.

&#x200B;

**C1: Alonzo Mourning (1995-02, 2005-08)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA Champion, 5x All-Star, 2x Defensive Player of the Year, 1x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 2x All-Defensive 1st Team

Stats: 16 PPG, 8.1 RPG, 1.1 APG, 0.5 SPG, 2.7 BPG

Alonzo Mourning was an elite center during the apex of his NBA career, and he played 11 seasons for the Miami Heat. Acquired in a trade by the Heat before the 1995-96 season, Mourning was impressive in his first three seasons with the franchise as he averaged 20.9 PPG, 10 RPG, and 2.6 BPG during that span while making the All-Star team twice. However, Mourning emerged as one of the NBA’s best defensive players over the next two seasons as he averaged 21.1 PPG, 10.1 RPG, and 3.8 BPG during that span while making an All-NBA team and winning the Defensive Player of the Year both times. Unfortunately, Mourning was diagnosed with kidney disease before the 2000-01 season which would affect the rest of his career. He played in 13 games that season and averaged 15.7 PPG, 8.4 RPG, and 2.5 BPG the next season before missing the entire 2002-03 season due to those kidney issues. Mourning returned to the Heat for a second stint that lasted three-and-a-half seasons which included helping the Heat win a championship in 2006 before retiring.

&#x200B;

**C2: Shaquille O’Neal (2004-08)**

Accolades w/Team: 1 Finals Appearance, 1x NBA Champion, 3x All-Star, 2x All-NBA 1st Team

Stats: 19.6 PPG, 9.1 RPG, 2.1 APG, 0.4 SPG, 1.9 BPG

Shaquille O’Neal was a really good center in three-and-a-half-years with the Miami Heat even though it wasn’t as tremendous as his Magic and Lakers tenures. Acquired by the Heat during the 2004 offseason, O’Neal thrived in his first season in South Beach as he averaged 22.9 PPG, 10.4 RPG, and 2.3 BPG while placing second in the MVP voting. Even though Shaq’s next season was shortened to 59 games due to injuries, he was still really good as he averaged 20 PPG and 9.2 RPG while helping the Heat win a championship that year. Unfortunately, after that championship run, O’Neal was never the same player due to those aforementioned injuries. Shaq played in just 40 games the following year while averaging 17.3 PPG and 7.4 RPG and making the All-Star team still. However, O’Neal struggled in the 2007-08 season as his stats went down to 14.2 PPG and 7.8 RPG, and he was traded to the Phoenix Suns mid-way through that season.

&#x200B;

**C3: Hassan Whiteside (2014-19)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 14.1 PPG, 11.9 RPG, 0.6 APG, 0.7 SPG, 2.4 BPG

Hassan Whiteside was signed with the Miami Heat a month into the 2014-15 season and was a very good center in five seasons with the team. He was solid in 48 games that season, despite being sent to the D-League at times during the first half of that season, as he averaged 11.8 PPG and 10 RPG. Whiteside emerged as one of the better defensive bigs over the next two seasons as he averaged 15.7 PPG, 13 RPG, and 2.9 BPG during that span. However, his last two seasons haven’t been much as he hasn’t helped the Heat much despite averaging 13 PPG and 11.4 RPG during that span. He was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers just this offseason after his production dropped in those last two seasons.

&#x200B;

**C4: Rony Seikaly (1988-94)**

Stats: 15.4 PPG, 10.4 RPG, 1.3 APG, 0.7 SPG, 1.4 BPG

Rony Seikaly was a very good center in his six seasons with the Miami Heat. As the first-ever draft pick in the history of the franchise, Seikaly had a solid rookie season as he averaged 10.9 PPG and 7 RPG. However, Seikaly improved in his sophomore season as he averaged 16.6 PPG and 10.4 RPG while winning that year’s Most Improved Player. After that much improved season, Seikaly remained a really good big man over the next three seasons as he averaged 16.6 PPG and 11.6 RPG during that span. After averaging 15.1 PPG and 10.3 RPG in the 1993-94 season, Seikaly was traded to the Golden State Warriors before the 1994-95 season.

**Analysis**

* This all-time team's starting lineup is really good. The Big Three in Miami during the early 2010s and the duo of Hardaway and Mourning of the late 1990s team up to create this all-time team's starting five. They have excellent playmaker and scorer Tim Hardaway at the point, all-around shooting guard and very good defender Dwyane Wade, the King, All-Star and stretch four Chris Bosh, and Alonzo Mourning who was a solid inside presence both offensively and defensively.
* The bench doesn't have a lot of All-Stars (with the Heat), but that second unit is really good. Dragic was an All-Star and has been a very good point guard. In addition, you have one of the most dominant centers in Shaq, three-point shooter Glen Rice, and a really good three-and-D guy in Eddie Jones. In addition, Udonis Haslem, the backup four, was a solid post presence on both sides of the ball and provides great leadership as a Heat lifer.

1899,904,Why are Brandon Ingram's advanced stats so bad?,"You watch a game and you look at a player, say a Will Barton or Dennis Smith Jr., and you can immediately tell they aren't good basketball players (relative to their peers) - they are practically dying to show you how bad they are. 

You then look at their ""simple"" stats, and sure enough they are chuckers that do not contribute much else. You look at their advanced stats and you are not surprised to find them at the bottom of the league.

Now take Brandon Ingram, you watch him play and he doesn't immediately stick out as a bad player - he isn't forcing shots, he lets the game come to him most of the time, maybe he's a bit passive but he rebounds and his length has some impact on defense. He isn't a gamechanger, but he also doesn't make you want to gouge your eyes out.

You look at his simple stats and they're decently impressive, in fact you can [cherry pick some searches](http://bkref.com/tiny/vy3sS) and find him in some elite company for age/experience. A bit turnover prone though.

But then you look at his advanced stats - 175th in the league in [BPM](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2019_advanced.html), near dead last, or 55th in [RPM](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/page/2/position/5) among 3s, and even [PIPM](https://www.bball-index.com/18-pipm/) has him somewhere at the back of the league.

And it's not like he's dragging down the team on [defense statistically](https://on.nba.com/2ReYb1y) either.

Certainly helps that both Embiid and Lopez are proficient high volume 3pt shooters.

1902,907,Wiggins trade value,"Do you think Wolves should trade Wiggins?

I know that he looks a lot better out there and so far he is a main candidate for MIP but his trade value might be as high as ever since he signed the max.

Wolves has a tough decision to deal with:you betting your whole franchise on Wiggins and hope this start of the season isnt a fluke or you trade him while he is a positive or neutral contract.

Wolves franchise for the next years will depend on this decision.If Wiggins goes back to being mediocre to average then that means that they can lose Towns too and with it they would have to start another rebuilding.But another problem is if you can get rid of Wiggins what star would even want to come at Wolves?is worth getting rid of Wiggins for then to sign a Middleton/Tobias type of player for a max(borderline all star)?

1903,908,Wilt was not the most dominant scorer in NBA history (but he was still pretty damn good),"**Warning: this whole post is stupid and should not be taken seriously. Read at your own risk.**

Every NBA fan knows about the crazy numbers that Wilt put up back in the day.

* 50 points
* 25 rebounds
* 20,000 women

But the game has changed drastically since Wilt's heyday. Stat nerds have shown that [Wilt was not the rebounding god that he is made out to be](https://skepticalsports.com/the-case-for-dennis-rodman-part-14-c-rodman-v-ancient-history/). The following analysis will show that Wilt was also not the most dominant scorer in NBA history either (although he was elite while playing a ridiculous amount of minutes).

&nbsp;

^(Spoiler alert: it's Michael Jordan, but a few other people got close.)

----

**Wilt's Dominance**

Wilt Chamberlain put up some gaudy numbers back in the 1960's. Over his first six years in the NBA, he *averaged* [40.6 points and 24.9 rebounds per game](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/chambwi01.html#1960-1965-sum:per_game). These are numbers that [no modern player has approached in a single game](http://bkref.com/tiny/oZeQO).

Wilt's peak came in the 1961-62 season in which he averaged 50.4 PPG and 25.7 RPG. A quick glance at the [NBA's PPG leaders by year](https://i.imgur.com/ommA0ET.png) shows that this season stands head and shoulders above every other NBA performance in history.

Clearly Wilt was the most dominant scorer of all time, right?

----

**Wrong!**

Wilt's per-game numbers are inflated for two reasons:

1. The game was played at a frantic pace back then. In the 1961-62 season, Wilt's Warriors averaged 131 possessions per game, while modern teams average about 100. More possessions means more shot attempts, which means more points scored for ball dominant players.

2. Wilt almost never sat on the bench. In his ridiculous six year stretch from 1960-1965, he averaged 47 minutes per game, including an unbelievable 48.5 minutes per game in the 1961-62 season. Modern superstars typically average around 36 minutes per game ^(unless they play for Tom Thibodeau).

So Wilt played 33% more minutes than most modern players and had 31% more possessions per minute of game time.

This means **his stats are inflated by about 70%**.

----

**So how does Wilt stack up with modern scorers?**

Let's take a look at the [top per-possession scorers](https://i.imgur.com/GvfQoar.png) since the 1973-74 season, when possessions per game were first tracked. On the far right of the graph are the highest volume scorers. Here we mostly see the seasons that we expect:

* Michael Jordan's 37.1 PPG 1986-87 season
* Kobe's 35.4 PPG 2005-06 season
* Westbrook's 31.6 PPG 2016-17 triple-double season^*
* A bunch of other MJ seasons. Apparently he was pretty good.

^* ^(Wait what? Yep, Russ put up those numbers on only 34.6 MPG at a leisurely pace of 97.8 possessions per game)

[Now let's throw Wilt's best seasons (and Elgin Baylor's 38.3 PPG 1961-62 season for good measure) onto the same chart.](https://i.imgur.com/BnZ7y4G.png)

This gives us some perspective. Wilt's peak season lines up nicely with peak LeBron and peak Shaq in terms of volume and efficiency. Not bad company to be in, but certainly well short of the volume of MJ, Kobe, and (apparently) Russell Westbrook.

**In defense of Wilt's offense**

This should not detract from Wilt's legacy. Although his per-possession numbers are not the greatest of all time, we should note that Wilt was able to maintain **elite** scoring and rebounding while playing nearly every minute of every game at a time when the pace of an NBA game was insanely fast.

At 7'1"" 275 lb., Wilt was a giant who ran the length of the court 260+ times per game while scoring half of his team's points each night. Had he been able to rest a few minutes each night (which is hard to do when you're working your way through 20,000 women), perhaps his per-possession numbers would be more in line with modern superstars.

----

**Bonus content: inflating modern scoring numbers**  
**(warning: this is even dumber than the preceding content)**

Let's take MJ, Kobe, and Russ's best seasons from the chart above:

Season | PPG | RPG | APG
---|---|----|----
Jordan 1986-87 | 37.1 | 5.2 | 4.6
Kobe 2005-06 | 35.4 | 5.3 | 4.5
Westbrook 2016-17 | 31.6 | 10.7 | 10.4

Now let's put these guys on the 1961-62 Warriors and assume that they are able to maintain their per-possession numbers while playing every minute of every game as Wilt did back in the day. **This is a totally ridiculous assumption**, but whatever.

Here's what their stats would look like in this scenario:

Season | PPG | RPG | APG
---|---|----|----
Jordan 1961-62 | 60.8 | 8.6 | 7.6
Kobe 1961-62 | 59.7 | 8.9 | 7.6
Westbrook 1961-62 | 58.7 | 19.8 | 19.3

What does this mean? I don't know but it's fun to think about.

1904,909,NBA G.O.A.T. Survey Results,"Hey everyone! I have the complete set of survey results and analytics from the survey that I posted on here about 3 days ago. Thanks to you guys, i received an overwhelming amount of responses and feedback.

&#x200B;

**Here are the results:**  [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1iEbVeolgRd8VuFOx7WygLEPWk4XNVexktswDJyt0n5U/viewanalytics](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1iEbVeolgRd8VuFOx7WygLEPWk4XNVexktswDJyt0n5U/viewanalytics)

&#x200B;

**Breakdown of Results:**

Majority of survey participants are 90s babies, but there is a decent amount of 80s babies too.

Years of watching the NBA were pretty evenly distributed. 6-9 years was the most picked answer.

Interesting divide of answers for importance in a player's career: 47.9% believed Individual Success was more important than Team Success, and 52.1% believed in the opposite.

Number of Championships, Regular Season MVPs, and Career Stats were the top 3 most chosen measurements for G.O.A.T. criteria. There was a decent amount of ""other"" entries.

*Finally,* who is the G.O.A.T. of the NBA?

58.9% thought Michael Jordan

26.8% thought LeBron James

the remaining percentages were pretty evenly distributed between most of the other options (Kobe had 2.9% and Kareem had 4.8%).

&#x200B;

**Some things i should've done better in the survey are:**

set the year constraint to 1900-2019 inclusive rather than 0-2019 inclusive (i.e. some people would put 98 for birth year, and some people would put 1998; this lead to inconsistent data).

Should've added ""The Eye Test"", ""All-NBA Team Selections"", and some other criteria that you guys put as ""other"" when measuring the G.O.A.T. criteria.

Should've limited responses to 1 each (didn't know I could do that before i created the survey haha).

Should've made all questions required to answer (some people didn't answer all questions).

&#x200B;

Thanks for participating in the survey and giving me your input! I would love to hear what you guys think about the results.",nbadiscussion

1908,913,The free throw rates for the past 3 seasons are the lowest in recorded history,"From [Basketball Reference:](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats_per_game.html) the 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 are the 3 NBA seasons with the lowest recorded free throw rates in NBA history (ever since stats like FTA and FGA started being recorded for all games instead of just some, which was in 1973-74).

[Free throw rate](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/factors.html) is a stat that measures how often a player/team goes to the line and makes the free throws, considering the number of field goal attempts he/they take. The simple formula is FT/FGA.

[The average free throw percentage](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/share.fcgi?id=L9obe) the past 3 seasons is also close to the highest it has ever been, so it's not like the number of free throws made is much smaller than the number of free throws attempted.

What this shows is that the ""common sense"" (eye test-based) idea that referees are suddenly calling fouls way more often nowadays is COMPLETE NONSENSE. The people who claim that the refereeing was better and let players play more freely in the past are NOT basing their ideas on fact and reality, but rather on irrational nostalgia for past times.

In fact, the highest free throw rates in the past 30 years come from seasons like 2005-06 and 2006-07, exactly in the era ""it-was-better-in-the-past"" peple claim was better and tougher than today's.

And if you wany to respond to my post with a statement regarding the 'eye test"" and one which claims that you have objectively determined that referees today call more fouls than 10, 20, or even 30 years ago, I would recommend you read [this article](https://cleaningtheglass.com/how-to-watch-basketball/). An excerpt from it is this:

""The human eye is not designed to watch everything at once. You cannot physically see and process all 10 players plus the ball at once, in real time. And if you can’t do that, you can’t analyze the game and understand what happened, or scout a player effectively. That’s true for even the greatest basketball minds. Steve Clifford, after a playoff loss in 2016, said as much:

**I heard Pat Riley say this 16 years ago: “Until I watch the film, I really don’t know”…I just made my notes in there about what I think will happen…When I watch the film on the plane, half of it will be wrong.**

If Steve Clifford and Pat Riley can’t analyze the game without film, then you shouldn’t feel bad for not picking up on important aspects of the game when watching live. If you want to analyze and understand the game, you should follow their example: watch the film.""",nbadiscussion
1909,914,"Realistically speaking, which current NBA players are making and have promise to make the basketball hall of fame?","Okay, before I start, I want to categorize these players into three categories; Locks, Looks Good, and Great Potential. 

Locks consist of those players such as LeBron James, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant... The players that if they retired today, are basically in for sure or are locks.

Looks Good consists of players such as Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, and Jimmy Butler. They are proven players and have had great careers up to this point, but either are still a little too young or haven’t done quite enough to make it for sure. Regardless, they will probably make the Hall Of Fame.

Finally, Good Potential consists of players such as Luka Doncic, Zion Williamson, and Trae Young. In their first few seasons they’ve been superstars, but they haven’t necessarily stacked up the wins. It’s okay though, because they are still young and have whole careers ahead of them.


According to Basketball Reference, here are what current NBA players HOF odds[HOF odds](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/hof_prob.html) are.

I think the formula is accurate in predicting the Locks, but as for the other two categories it is relatively shaky for me due to a lack of experience and data from other players. After all, the calculator can’t see into the future.

Anyways, this is how I would place the current NBA players who have solid HOF chances.

Locks:
LeBron James,
Stephen Curry,
Kevin Durant,
Chris Paul,
Russell Westbrook,
James Harden,
Carmelo Anthony,
Vince Carter,
Pau Gasol,
Marc Gasol,
Dwight Howard,

Anthony Davis,
Draymond Green,
Derrick Rose,
Rajon Rondo,
Kemba Walker (with some winning seasons in Boston),

1910,915,How do the Lakers adjust for game 3?,"There were a couple of possessions near the end of the game where Caruso or Green was switched onto Jokic. It seems like the Nuggets are hell bent on running a pick and roll on those two to breakthrough the Laker defense. How should Frank Vogel  adjust?

AD on Murray, while Dwight on Jokic?
Lebron/Kuzma/Morris on Murray, while AD/Dwight on Jokic?

Also, the Nuggets seemed to have been able to force Lebron into inefficient midrange jumpers. If the Nuggets can reliably score, and reliability defend Lebron, this will be a close series with the winner being the team that can execute more over 48 minutes. AD will have to be a monster on isolation to carry this team. 

Thoughts?

Why does no one ever point to the 2014 Spurs? If you look over that team, they didn't have a single player who averaged more than 20pts a game. They had one all star on the team in Tony Parker.

It's looking like they end up as a seven or eight seed and face one of the Warriors/Nuggets/Rockets in the first round. All things included, they're shaping up to be a first round exit once again. 

Most Thunder fans, myself included, think Donovan should be on the hot seat. He's failed to implement any offensive scheme or legitimize this team since the KD departure. I realize this is only Paul George's second season there, but he's also on a long term deal and I think if you want to show off a championship focus, you get out from under the lackluster accountability and hire a coach that can lead to bigger heights. 

Obviously, shooting is an issue too. The team is full of volume scorers that aren't consistent with their numbers. Paul George (38.8) and Jerami Grant (38.7) are their best three point shooters while the others rank in the early thirties or in the late twenties such as Westbrook.

1917,922,How would you approach the Knicks off-season,"Thought this could be an interesting exercise we could do for all teams with cap space, starting with NY.

Let's assume the cap drops by 20M based on a middle ground made between estimates [1](https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/1974097) and [2](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/03/21/coronavirus-could-cost-nba-1-billion-bring-about-record-salary-cap-drop/).

Using [Spotrac](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/new-york-knicks/cap/2020/), Knicks have team options for Portis(15.8M) and Pinson(1.7M), non-guaranteed contracts for Gibson/Bullock/Ellington/Payton(thank god), all of whom have only 1M guaranteed. Damyean Dotson is a RFA. Cap holds for Dotson/Harper/Rabb. 6.5M dead cap because they waive+stretched Joakim Noah.

My off-season approach would be:

1. Decline team option for Portis, waive Gibson/Ellington/Payton. Fairly self-explanatory I would've thought.
2. Accept team option for Pinson, guarantee Bullock's money(good trade chip at the deadline to pick up some seconds)
3. Match offers up to 4/40M for Dotson. But realistically he won't get near the same amount; Jeremy Lamb got 3/31.5 iirc, and he has many more runs on the board. So just match whatever realistic offer Dot gets. Very dependable 2-way player.

At this stage, Knicks have around 47M committed to Randle/Barrett/Frank/DSJ/Knox/Bullock/Pinson/Robinson/Brazdeikis/Dotson cap hold, with 2 first rounders and second rounder to come in. 2 roster spots need to be filled through free agency. Pinson, DSJ are candidates to be waived if better options appear in the draft and free agency

4.  Offer VanVleet similar contract to what Barnes received last summer(4/85 declining to 18M by the fourth year). Just a great fit. Start FVV/Frank or Dot/RJ/Knox/Robinson next year. FVV can run the point to a decent level, but can also slide off the ball when RJ and if Frank take a step as primary ballhandlers; until then he relieves the pressure off those guys to create for the team, and also gives the team a reliable way to create advantage offensively through the FVV/Robinson PnR. This opens up more opportunities for Dot, RJ, Knox to attack off the catch.

   5.  It couldn't hurt to sign one more competent PG off the bench, especially if the Raps somehow matched 4/85 for FVV. Guys like Ferrell/Napier/McLaughlin fit the bill, able to play on or offball. I guess this one depends on whether they still believe in DSJ. I don't think it'd be awful to spread the PG minutes distribution to something like FVV 32, Frank 12, RJ 4 if DSJ doesn't pan out.

   6.  Sign more young talent. Korkmaz/Josh Jackson/Derrick Jones Jr. are 3 of the better ones(Melton, Beasley might be out of the Knicks price range, if they aren't they're included here) are wings(can't have enough of them in today's game) with some upside. I'd have 3 year deals offered to DJJ/Korkmaz at least. Getting one of these guys across the line probably means its curtains for either DSJ or Pinson.

   7.  Sign another C. I would cap Randle to 24 MPG next season, with 12-16 playing as a small ball C where he actually could contribute in a way that doesn't destroy offensive flow; but anyway in that scenario you would still need some insurance at C especially with Robinson's fouling issues. Billy Hernangomez, Harry Giles, Skal Labissiere all make sense as guys who are NBA level but also have some upside left in them. Backup plan would be to offer TT/Plumlee/Ibaka/Noel/Favors 1 year deals for good money, again with a view to trading them at the trade deadline like they did with Marcus Morris this past season.",nbadiscussion
1918,923,Isiah Thomas Underated,"Let me paint a picture for you.

 Arguably should be three  1988 finals against the Lakers.  Game 6 pistons up 3-2 Isiah rolls his ankle in the third finishes with 43 points and a 25 point 3rd quarter. Gets his team back in it , pistons up one last play of the game ball goes to Kareem, Kareem goes up for a sky hook over Lambier and misses but a phantom foul was called, Kareem sinks two fts giving the Lakers game six and IT's  ankle makes him a non factor game seven. 

I get it his numbers were never WOW like  but IT is so much more than those numbers, he was the heart and soul of them Pistons teams and beat 3 of the greatest players ever on great teams in series while they were in their prime.  And he gets no credit all time, no mention all time except as part of the bad boy pistons that MJ conquered. That's what he's relagated to. That and for MJ hating him so much he kept him off the dream team.  So if you get a chance go watch some IT, watch some of them bad boy piston games.

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 10x All-Star, 1993 All-Star Game MVP, 2x All-NBA 1st Team, 6x All-NBA 2nd Team, 3x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 13.1 PPG, 2.7 RPG, 10.5 APG, 2.2 SPG, 0.2 BPG

As the all-time leader in assists and steals, John Stockton is one of the greatest point guards in NBA history, spending his entire 19-year career with the Jazz. Drafted 16th overall in the 1984 NBA Draft, Stockton was solid while coming off the bench in his first three seasons as he averaged 7.1 PPG, 6.9 APG, and 1.8 SPG during that span. Over the next nine seasons after that span, Stockton led the NBA in assists in each of those seasons as he averaged 15.7 PPG, 13.1 APG, and 2.6 SPG during those nine seasons while making the All-Star team eight times as well as an All-NBA team in each of those nine seasons. Although Stockton never led the NBA in assists in any of the seven seasons after the 1995-96 season, he was still among the leaders in that category as he averaged 12.3 PPG, 8.6 APG, and 1.7 SPG in those final seven seasons, which included two NBA Finals appearances in 1997 and 1998, before retiring after the 2002-03 offseason. Not only was Stockton an elite point guard during his nineteen years in Utah, but he was also really healthy as he only missed 22 games throughout his entire career.

&#x200B;

**PG2: Deron Williams (2005-11)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 17.3 PPG, 3.2 RPG, 9.1 APG, 1.1 SPG, 0.2 BPG

Drafted third overall in the 2005 NBA Draft, Deron Williams was in the discussion of the best point guard in the NBA during the late 2000s when he played for the Utah Jazz. After averaging 10.8 PPG and 4.5 APG during his rookie year, D-Will improved as the full-time starting point guard in his second season as he averaged 16.2 PPG and 9.3 APG while helping the Jazz make the Western Conference Finals that year. After that breakout sophomore season, D-Will emerged as one of the NBA’s top point guards over the next three seasons as he averaged 19 PPG and 10.6 APG during that span while making the All-Star team once and the All-NBA 2nd Team twice. Williams averaged 21.3 PPG and 9.7 APG in the first 53 games of the 2010-11 season with the Utah Jazz while making his second All-Star team before being traded to the New Jersey Nets during that season.

&#x200B;

**SG1: Pete Maravich (1974-80)**

Accolades w/Team: 3x All-Star, 2x All-NBA 1st Team, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 25.2 PPG, 4.3 RPG, 5.6 APG, 1.4 SPG, 0.3 BPG

The then-New Orleans Jazz, heading into their inaugural season, acquired former LSU superstar Pete Maravich from the Atlanta Hawks in a blockbuster trade during their expansion draft. Maravich continued with his impressive scoring in his first two seasons with the Jazz as he averaged 23.4 PPG, 5.1 RPG, and 5.8 APG during that span. However, Maravich had a huge 1976-77 campaign as he averaged a league-leading 31.1 PPG, 5.1 RPG, and 5.4 APG while making the All-NBA 1st Team. Despite dealing with knee issues the next season which caused him to miss 32 games, Maravich was still excellent that season as he averaged 27 PPG, 3.6 RPG, and 6.7 APG en route to another All-NBA 1st Team selection. Unfortunately for Pistol Pete, those knee issues would continue to hamper his play. He averaged 22.6 PPG and 5 APG the next season while missing 33 games, and the following year, after the team moved to Utah, he averaged 17.1 PPG in just 17 games before being waived midseason.

&#x200B;

**SG2: Darrell Griffith (1980-91)**

Accolades w/Team: 1980-81 Rookie of the Year

Stats: 16.2 PPG, 3.3 RPG, 2.1 APG, 1.2 SPG, 0.3 BPG

Drafted second overall by the Utah Jazz in the 1980 NBA Draft to replace Pete Maravich, Darrell Griffith was an excellent dunker and three-point shooter during his ten seasons with the franchise. He was really good in his rookie season as he averaged 20.6 PPG en route to winning the Rookie of the Year award. Griffith averaged 21 PPG over his next two seasons before helping the Jazz make the playoffs for the first time in franchise history during the 1983-84 season. During that season, Griffith averaged 20 PPG while breaking the NBA’s record in three-pointers made in a season with 91 and shooting 36.1% on 3.1 attempts per game. Griffith improved even more in the next season as he averaged 22.6 PPG, broke his record for most threes made in a season with 92 while shooting 35.8% on 3.3 attempts per game. Unfortunately, Griffith missed the entire 1985-86 season due to a foot injury and averaged just 11 PPG in his final five seasons before retiring.

&#x200B;

**SG3: Jeff Hornacek (1994-00)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances

Stats: 14.4 PPG, 2.8 RPG, 4 APG, 1.3 SPG, 0.2 BPG

Jeff Hornacek was acquired by the Utah Jazz during the 1993-94 season to help bolster their three-point shooting. Hornacek played in 27 games for the Jazz that season while averaging 14.6 PPG during those games. Hornacek would be the starting shooting guard and a solid piece on some contending Jazz teams over the next four seasons as he averaged 15.1 PPG and 4.3 APG while shooting 42% from three-point range on 2.4 attempts per game during that span. Hornacek played under 30 MPG in each of his final two seasons, but he averaged 12.3 PPG while shooting 45.7% from three on 1.8 attempts per game and 95% from the free-throw line in his final season before retiring after that final 1999-00 season.

&#x200B;

**SF1: Adrian Dantley (1979-86)**

Accolades w/Team: 6x All-Star, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team

Stats: 29.6 PPG, 6.2 RPG, 3.7 APG, 1.1 SPG, 0.1 BPG

Adrian Dantley averaged 19.9 PPG and 7.2 RPG over his first three seasons on three separate teams before being traded to the Utah Jazz before the 1979-80 season. Dantley took advantage of this opportunity with the Jazz and averaged 28 PPG and 7.6 RPG in his first season with them while making his first All-Star team. Over the next four seasons, Dantley was one of the best scorers in the NBA as he averaged 30.5 PPG, 6.1 RPG, and 4 APG, while shooting 56.4% from the field during that span, leading the league in scoring twice during those four years, and averaging at least 30 PPG in each of those seasons. Even though Dantley never averaged 30 PPG after the 1983-84 season, he was still an exceptional scorer in his last two seasons with the Jazz while averaging 28.5 PPG, 5.5 RPG, and 3.4 APG during that span while making the All-Star team both times. However, Dantley was traded to the Detroit Pistons during the 1986 offseason.

&#x200B;

**SF2: Andrei Kirilenko (2001-11)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star, 1x All-Defensive 1st Team, 2x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 12.4 PPG, 5.6 RPG, 2.8 APG, 1.4 SPG, 2 BPG

Despite being drafted 24th overall by the Utah Jazz in the 1999 NBA Draft, Andrei Kirilenko did not join the franchise until 2001. He was solid in his first two seasons as he averaged 11.4 PPG, 5.1 RPG, 1.4 SPG, and 2.1 BPG during that span. However, Kirilenko broke out in his third season, after the retirement of John Stockton and the departure of Karl Malone, as he averaged 16.5 PPG, 8.1 RPG, 3.1 APG, 1.9 SPG, and 2.8 BPG en route to his first All-Star selection. He was a really good defensive power forward in that season as well as the two after that as he averaged 15.4 PPG, 7.3 RPG, 3.9 APG, 1.5 SPG, and 3.2 BPG during those two seasons which both resulted in All-Defensive selections. Kirilenko’s role decreased over his last five seasons with the Jazz as he averaged 10.8 PPG, 4.8 RPG, and 3.1 APG during that span before returning to Russia during the 2011 NBA lockout.

&#x200B;

**SF3: Gordon Hayward (2010-17)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star

Stats: 15.7 PPG, 4.2 RPG, 3.4 APG, 1 SPG, 0.4 BPG

After coming a half-court heave that hit back iron away from winning a national championship for Butler in 2010, Gordon Hayward was selected with the tenth overall pick in that year’s draft by the Utah Jazz, where he’d spent seven seasons while increasing his points per game average after each year. He didn’t get much playing time in his rookie season as he averaged 5.4 PPG on 16.9, he would start at small forward for the team during his sophomore season while averaging 11.8 PPG. After averaging 17.4 PPG, 4.5 RPG, and 4 APG over the next four seasons, Hayward made the All-Star team for the first time in the 2016-17 season while averaging 21.9 PPG, 5.4 RPG, and 3.5 APG which helped the Jazz make the playoffs for the first time since 2012. After that season, Hayward signed with the Boston Celtics as a free agent during the 2017 offseason.

&#x200B;

**SF4: Thurl Bailey (1983-91, 1999)**

Stats: 14 PPG, 5.5 RPG, 1.6 APG, 0.5 SPG, 1.2 BPG

Thurl Bailey was selected with the seventh overall pick by the Utah Jazz in the 1983 NBA draft after helping N.C. State upset Houston in the 1983 NCAA Tournament Final in one of the greatest upsets in NCAA history. Bailey started in his first two seasons with the franchise as he averaged 11.8 PPG and 6.1 RPG during that span. However, Bailey took a bench role after his sophomore season, which he held for six seasons as he averaged 15.7 PPG and 5.5 RPG during that span which included a two-season span from 1987-89 where he averaged 19.5 PPG and 6 RPG. However, Bailey averaged just 9.4 PPG and 6 RPG over the first 13 games of the 1991-92 season before being traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves during that season. He returned for the 1999 lockout season but didn’t do much before retiring after that season.

&#x200B;

**PF1: Karl Malone (1985-2003)**

Accolades w/Team: 2 Finals Appearances, 2x NBA MVP, 14x All-Star, 2x All-Star Game MVP, 11x All-NBA 1st Team, 2x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team, 3x All-Defensive 1st Team, 1x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 25.4 PPG, 10.2 RPG, 3.5 APG, 1.4 SPG, 0.8 BPG

With the second-most points scored in NBA history, Karl Malone is one of the greatest power forwards of all-time and the greatest player to play for this franchise with 18 excellent years. Drafted 13th overall by the Utah Jazz in the 1985 NBA Draft, Malone was very good in his rookie year as he averaged 14.9 PPG and 8.9 RPG, and improved in his second season where he averaged 21.7 PPG and 10.4 RPG. However, starting with his third season, Malone was selected to an All-NBA Team for fourteen consecutive seasons from 1987-2001. During that span, the Mailman averaged 27 PPG, 10.6 RPG, and 3.6 APG, made the All-NBA 1st Team eleven times out of those fourteen All-NBA selections, made the All-Defensive Team four times, helped the Jazz make the NBA Finals in both 1997 and 1998, and won two MVPs in 1997 and 1999. Interestingly enough, Malone didn’t make an All-NBA Team in his final two seasons, but he didn’t really slow down much as he still averaged 21.5 PPG, 8.2 RPG, 4.5 APG, and 1.8 APG during that final two-year span with the franchise before signing with the L.A. Lakers during the 2003 offseason.

&#x200B;

**PF2: Carlos Boozer (2004-10)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team

Stats: 19.3 PPG, 10.5 RPG, 2.9 APG, 1 SPG, 0.4 BPG

Carlos Boozer signed with the Utah Jazz as a free agent during the 2004 offseason after averaging 15.5 PPG and 11.4 RPG in the previous season. Boozer was plagued with injuries in his first two seasons with the team as he only played in 84 games, but he was good as he averaged 17.2 PPG and 8.8 RPG during that span. However, Boozer made the All-Star team in each of his next two seasons as he averaged 21 PPG, 11 RPG, and 2.9 APG during that span while shooting 55.3% from the field. After an injury-plagued 2008-09 season where he played in just 37 games, Boozer bounced back in the next season as he averaged 19.5 PPG and 11.2 RPG during his last season with the Jazz before being traded to the Chicago Bulls during the 2010 offseason.

&#x200B;

**PF3: Truck Robinson (1977-79)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 1st Team

Stats: 23.2 PPG, 14.9 RPG, 2 APG, 0.8 SPG, 1.1 BPG

Signed by the New Orleans Jazz during the 1977 offseason, Truck Robinson played in a season and a half with the franchise. During his first and only full season with the team, Truck averaged 22.7 PPG, and a league-leading 15.7 RPG despite being a 6’7” power forward en route to his first All-Star selection and a selection to the All-NBA 1st Team. Truck continued his production next season as he averaged 24.2 PPG and 13.4 RPG in 43 games with the Jazz that season. However, despite Robinson’s play, the Jazz were losing a lot of games, and Robinson was traded to the Phoenix Suns during the middle of that 1978-79 season.

&#x200B;

**C1: Rudy Gobert (2013-)**

Accolades w/Team: 2x Defensive Player of the Year, 1x All-NBA 2nd Team, 1x All-NBA 3rd Team, 3x All-Defensive 1st Team

Stats: 11.1 PPG, 10.5 RPG, 1.3 APG, 0.7 SPG, 2.2 BPG

The first and only current Jazz player to make this all-time team, Rudy Gobert has been a defensive force during his six seasons in Utah so far. After not getting much playing time in his rookie season, Gobert improved in his next two seasons, with the Jazz trading center Enes Kanter, as he averaged 8.7 PPG, 10.1 RPG, and 2.3 BPG during that span. The past three seasons have been really dominant for Gobert as he has averaged 14.6 PPG, 12.3 RPG, and 2.4 BPG during that span which has garnered him a selection on the All-Defensive 1st Team in all three of those seasons and two All-NBA selections in those three years as well as two Defensive Player of the Year awards in the past two years. Heading into the 2019-20 season, Gobert looks to continue his dominance on the defensive end while continuing his improvement on offense with the addition of point guard Mike Conley.

&#x200B;

**C2: Mark Eaton (1982-93)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star, 2x Defensive Player of the Year, 3x All-Defensive 1st Team, 2x All-Defensive 2nd Team

Stats: 6 PPG, 7.9 RPG, 1 APG, 0.4 SPG, 3.5 BPG

Mark Eaton was drafted in the third round of the 1982 NBA Draft despite being 25 years old, but he turned out to be one of the best shot-blockers in NBA history. After averaging 4.3 PPG, 5.7 RPG, and 3.4 BPG in his rookie season, Eaton became the Jazz’s starting center in his second season while averaging 5.6 PPG, 7.3 RPG, and a league-leading 4.3 BPG. Eaton improved even more in his third season as he averaged 9.7 PPG, 11.3 RPG, and an NBA record 5.6 BPG en route to the first of his two Defensive Player of the Year awards. Eaton continued to be a dominant shot-blocker over his next four seasons as he averaged 7.3 PPG, 9.1 RPG, and 4.1 BPG during that span while making an All-Defensive Team in each of those seasons. However, Eaton started to slow down after his only All-Star selection in the 1988-89 season as he averaged 4.1 PPG, 6.6 RPG, and 2.2 BPG in his final four seasons before retiring.

&#x200B;

**C3: Mehmet Okur (2004-11)**

Accolades w/Team: 1x All-Star

Stats: 15.3 PPG, 7.6 RPG, 1.9 APG, 0.5 SPG, 0.7 BPG

After averaging 9.6 PPG and 5.9 RPG off the bench for the Pistons on their championship squad in 2004, Mehmet Okur signed with the Utah Jazz as a free agent during that offseason. Okur came off the bench for a majority of his first season with the team as he averaged 12.9 PPG and 7.5 RPG, but he improved as the starting center in his second season with the Jazz as he averaged 18 PPG and 9.1 RPG. Okur was one of the best stretch bigs over the next four seasons as he averaged 15.7 PPG and 7.4 PRG while shooting 39.7% from the three-point line on 3.5 attempts per game. Unfortunately, Okur dealt with an Achilles injury that limited him to just 13 games in the 2010-11 season before being traded to the Nets during the 2011 offseason.

**TL;DR All-Time Jazz Roster**

||*Head Coach*|*Assistant Coaches*|
|Coaching Staff|Jerry Sloan|Quin Snyder, Frank Layden|

**Analysis**

* This is another high-octane offense among these All-Time teams in the Western Conference (the Kings, Suns, Nuggets just to name a few). With Stockton passing to Malone, Maravich, Dantley, or Gobert, the Jazz can score in many ways. Pistol Pete had the shooting ability, Dantley was an excellent scorer along with the Mailman who can deliver in the paint as well as efficient scoring big Rudy Gobert, and even Stockton could score as he was a really good three-point shooter. Among those elite offenses of the All-Time teams, the Jazz have a really good defense compared to the Suns and Kings as Stockton and Malone have both made multiple All-Defensive teams and Gobert can defend other bigs in the paint.
* The bench has a really good offense. Like Stockton, Deron Williams could pass the ball well and shoot threes although his defense is quite worse. He has a lot of options like Griffith who can drive inside and shoot threes, and Boozer with his excellent mid-range game. Manning the middle is center Mark Eaton who will not score a lot of points, but he will get a lot of blocks as will Kirilenko at the backup small forward who can defend and score very well.

1921,926,[OC] NBA Concise History with focus on Rules and League Settings - for better discussion on player comparison across eras (30000+ character),"*(I originally posted this on r/NBA but got no love; hope to try my luck again here!)*

Many of us (esp. r/NBA) love comparing players. Me too. Lebron or Jordan? Nash or Magic or Jerry West? Would Wilt Chamberlain be dominant in today's game? Would Curry & Durant die playing in the physical 90s? Can Dwight suddenly dominate the game like a decade ago?

I think a better understanding of history of NBA will lead to more meaningful discussions on player comparison. There are many ""NBA history"" articles online, but most put focus on player achievements and team results. So I want to write a summary of NBA history which only focus on stuff that affect player performance and team building - **the rules, the league settings and other circumstances of different eras**. 

Disclaimer: it is just a piece of casual, unauthoritative write-up based 
on 25+ years of NBA news-following and a week of reading from Google searches, including NBA.com, Wikipedia, SI vaults, old NY Times articles, various forum (incl. Reddit, ISH, RealGM etc.) and blogs. I wish I can find the old NBA rules before 2005 (the actual rules, not the summary) but was in vain.

I already try my best minimizing it, otherwise many topics could be elaborated to 5 times longer and exceed the character limit.

*Please consider it a draft. Correction and criticism welcome, but response might be slow due to different time zone and working hours.*

## (1) Pre Shot Clock Era (1946-1954, 8 seasons)

Notable Superstars: George Mikan, Dolph Schayes, Joe Fulks

The era is dominated by Minneapolis Lakers & George Mikan. They won 5 of 6 seasons (Lakers joined in 1948) and in 1951 they lost as Mikan was injured.

\- Key differences -

- **No shot clock**, no 3 points, zone defense disallowed
- Paint area was 6 feet only (widened to 12' in 1951)
- Number of teams fluctuated from 11 to 8 to 17 to 10
- Number of games fluctuated from 60 to 48 to 72
- Number of playoff format changed almost every year to cater for changes in number of teams (even a double round-robin in 1953!)
- No free agency, no salary cap

\- Discussions on rules -

The game was very different from today's game, so **don't do any statistical comparison with this era.** The league was still in its infancy stage.

- Without shot clock, the leading team would slow down to burn time. The trailing team would have to foul, forcing free throw (or jump ball!) to regain possession. Late-game fouls plagued the game and frustrated the fans.

- There was **no team foul limit**. Instead, every non-shooting foul led to 1 free throw (FT), then possession went to the fouling team. There were lots of free throws and the overall game time was very long.

- Initially, **the lane (paint area) was only 6 feet wide**. The game was dominated by big men, including 6'10"" George Mikan. Big men could just stay very close to the basket and wait for opportunity to score. Subsequently, the league widened the lane to 12' in 1951 ""to move the big men out"".

- Rule enforcement of palming and traveling were very strict.

\- Other Observations -

- Teams were fighting for survival financially in the new league. There were no money from TV broadcast. After reaching a max. 17 teams in 1949,  teams folded (even mid-season) almost every year, down to 8 teams in 1954. With little money, the arena and the equipment were not good at all (more on this later).

- Most players were less athletic due to poorer nutrition and training machines. Many weren't full-time basketball pro anyway. The FG% was abysmal, despite improving from 27% to 37%.

- The game was **very violent**, with punches thrown frequently, spectators harassing players and throwing litter for calls they don't like.

- There were only awards for All-NBA team (2 teams), All-Star Game MVP (1951) and Rookie of the Year (1952).


## (2) Shot Clock (8-team) Era (1954-1966, 12 seasons)

Notable Superstars: Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, Wilt Chamberlain, Bob Pettit, Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, Oscar Robertson

The era is dominated by Boston Celtics & Bill Russell. They won 9 of 10 seasons since Russell joined in 1956, and Boston lost in 1958 with Russell injured.

\- Key differences -

- **No 3 points**, zone defense disallowed
- Paint area was 12 feet only (widened to 18' in 1964)
- **hand-checking not prohibited**
- Number of teams = 8 (to 9 in 1961)
- Number of games gradually increased from 72 to 78
- 6 teams qualify for playoffs
- Still no free agency nor salary cap

\- Discussions on rules -

Games was closer to modern era, but still without 3 pointers. The competition level was much higher than previous era and talents were concentrated in 8 teams. 

- **Shot clock was introduced** which change basketball totally. Teams no longer needed to foul to regain possession in late game. Since they needed to shoot within 24s, they played run-and-gun to create space to score as close to basket as possible. The pace was up tremendously, and the scores skyrocketed from 80 to 110. 

- FG% was still low but improved gradually, going up steadily from 37% to a respectable 43%. The fast pace and low FG% led to **lots of rebounds** (73 in 1960 vs 43 in 2017). 

- Meanwhile, despite the run-and-gun, **assist-to-FG ratio is relatively low** (50% in 60s vs 60% in 80s onwards). It might be because scorekeepers in later eras were more generous in giving assists to home team for publicity purpose.   

- The league was still dominated by big men (Russell & Wilt), so the league further **widened the lane to 18 feet** in 1964.  

- All backcourt fouls led to 2 FT. Also, **team foul limit** was introduced to reduce fouls. On the 6th fouls per quarter, a bonus FT was given. Non-shooting fouls gave 2FT. Backcourt fouls and shooting fouls (missed) gave 3-to-make-2 FT. Shooting fouls (made) gave 2-to-make-1 FT. 

- **Hack-a-Wilt**! His FT% =50% in 1960. He had to go ""hide-and-seek"" to prevent opponents fouling him at late game, making it a silly scene. The league reacted by making away-from-the-ball fouls in the final 2 minutes of the game gave 1 FT *with fouled team keeping possession*. It was effective as there was no record of Hack-a-Shaq until 90s.

- Footage of 60s NBA showed players with amateur-looking dribbling. That's because the **rules on palming was still stringent**. The palm needed to be strictly on top of the ball, and players dribbled with pronated wrist. Dribble penetration was difficult as it was not easy to control the ball in such stance. Even for very skillful players (e.g. Bob Cousy), dribble penetration was not as effective as today because defenders packed the paint (there was no reason to move out to defend an ineffective long distance 2)

\- Other Observations -

- Having **no free agency** was a big factor why Boston kept dominating the era. Basically, the ""option clause"" in contracts before 1976 bounded the players to a single team in perpetuity. NBA was a monopoly. If you didn't want to play for a team after your contract is up, you would have to sit out for 1 whole year (which no decent player would do). Players had no leverage to demand a trade. ""Loyalty"" was a non-issue because the players had no choice. So, once a good team was formed, only injury could dismantle it. These made the draft ultra-important, and Boston's Red Auerbach was brilliant in picking talents.

- The arena and equipment was still not good, but improving. Reportedly some venues were cold & breezy. Courts might have ""dead spots"" where ball don't bounce. Game balls could be bad and non-uniform. These poor conditions might be reasons for the lower FG% in the beginning of this era, but we'd never know how much the players' performance was affected. Anyway, stuff were gradually improving with increasing popularity and more money from, say, TV.

- **Flopping** was as old as the league. Frank Ramsey, who played for Boston in 50s-60s, actually wrote a book on his flopping. There is no ""return to the men's game in good old days""; every era has its own floppers.

- The league had **more African-American players**, which led to increased athleticism and pace.

- Awards were added for MVP (1955) and All-Rookie team (1 team, 1962).


## (3) Expansion Era (1966-1979, 13 seasons)

Notable Superstars: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Julius Erving, John Havlicek, Rick Barry, Willis Reed, Walt Frazier, Wes Unseld, Elvin Hayes, Bob McAdoo, Pete Maravich, etc.

This period was all about the rise and merge of rival league ABA and the resulting expansion to 22 NBA teams. It was a period of parity. Although Boston and LA were the consistent powerhouses, 9 teams won the championship within these 13 seasons.

\- Key differences -

- Still **no 3 points** and zone defense disallowed
- **hand-checking not disallowed** most of the era
- **Number of teams: gradually increased from 10 to 22**
- Number of games: became 82 since 1967
- Playoff teams gradually increased from 8 to 12, with division leaders having 1st round bye
- No free agency nor salary cap, but has rival league ABA


\- Discussions on the expansion -

The formation of **rival league ABA in 1967** and the subsequent **merge in 1976** caused big changes to team rosters:

- More teams means a **dilution of talents**. Great young players were being drafted to different teams. Stacked team was difficult to form due to no free agency. To make things worse, some stars jumped ship to ABA for higher salary (e.g. Rick Barry). 

- With competition from ABA, players finally had the leverage to ask for a higher salary or demand trade. As players' salary increased, teams had to think twice before signing multiple superstars to long-term contract, especially for small market teams.

- Before 1971, only players who finished 4 years of college (or equivalent time) could be drafted. In 1971 , the court rules that such restriction was illegal. With the restriction lifted and to compete with ABA for young talents, underclassmen and high school players began to be drafted in NBA.

As a result, **teams were less stacked** and filled with some unproven talents, which might be the main reasons for the period of parity.

\- Discussions on rules -

The game was similar to the previous era, except:

- **Free throws for non-shooting fouls were finally eliminated in 1972**;  fouled team kept possession and inbounds the ball. This led to a sharp drop in FT attempted (31 to 25).

- In late 70s, there were some serious fights (e.g. Jabbar punched Kent Benson and Kermit Washington punched Rudy Tomjanovich in 77) which prompted NBA to crack down on fights by imposing **fines and suspensions for fights**.

- **In 1976, hand-checking was explicitly permitted** ""as long as it does not impede the opponent's progress"". Initially, hand-checking was for interior defense only; perimeter defense usually slack off due to low long-range threat (there was no 3 pointers). However, hand-checking was considered to have increased chance of fights, leading to its ban in 1978 (discuss in next era).

- The officiating on palming was relaxed, probably due to influence of ABA.  Players got away with wrist rotation and having palm slightly away from the top of the ball (not on the side, yet). Players had slightly more control of the ball for creative dribbling. However, effectiveness of dribble penetration in half court offense was still limited for various reasons (discuss more in 90s)

- **Steal and Block** records started in 1973, **Turnover** in 1977.

\- Other observations -

- **NBA lost popularity** in late 70s, and the suggested reasons include:

  - Parity and dilution mentioned above;
  - Drug problems;
  - Media didn't like NBA's best player Jabbar
  - TV Broadcaster CBS showed NBA games during non-prime time and even by tape-delay

- Many superstars ""lost"" a lot of official NBA stats as they spent some of their prime in ABA, including Dr. J, Iceman, Malone, Barry, Artis Gilmore, Dan Issel, etc. That's a big reason why the 70s superstars' seems relatively underwhelming.

- With the parity, low popularity and underwhelming stats, superstars in 70s received less love from today's fans. However, don't let it affect your judgment on their basketball skill and flair. e.g. Dr. J and Pistol Pete highlights were fun to watch.
  
- Number of trades increased from <10 per year in 60s to >20 in 70s. More trades means higher chance of lopsided trades, especially with the inexperienced team management of the new teams. Starting in 70s, we could see that lopsided trades made Champions. e.g. Bucks won in 1971 after trading for Oscar Robertson. 

- Awards were added for All-Defensive Team (1968) and Finals MVP (1969)


## (4) 3-Pointer (Magic & Bird) Era (1979-1988, 9 seasons)

Notable Superstars: Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Moses Malone, George Gervin, Isiah Thomas, Kevin McHale, James Worthy, etc.

Magic's Showtime Lakers and Bird's Celtics Big 3 dominated the era, with Lakers winning 5 titles and Boston 3. All Finals involved Lakers or Celtics. 

\- Key differences -

- **Illegal defense rules introduced in 1981**
- **Hand-checking disallowed in 1978**
- Number of teams = 23
- **Playoff teams increased to 16 in 1983**
- Limited ""free"" agency with compensation rule

\- Discussions on rules -

To regain popularity, the league tried many things to improve the entertainment value of NBA, including the 3-pointers which was used in ABA. The game became very close to the one today.

- **3-pointers were introduced** to ""give smaller players a chance to score and open up the defense to make the game more enjoyable for the fans"". However, in most of 80s, the game retained the run-and-gun style with slow infusion of the 3pt shots. After all, the players weren't trained to have 3pt range, and long shots used to be desperation shots. Teams attempted less than three 3pts per game in the first 5 seasons. 

- Zone defense had always been disallowed, but teams had always run some kind zone D (illegally) anyway. **Illegal defense** rules in 1981 aimed to completely stop zone defense so as to further open up the lane. However, it seemed the enforcement wasn't very stringent. Besides, the new rules were considered very confusing for everyone, incl. players, referees and fans.

- In 1978 ""**Hand checking** and other illegal use of hands was eliminated."" Contrary to popular belief, real hand-checking was already eliminated in 78. However, impact were not as big as in 90s, possibly because (1) enforcement was not stringent, because it was difficult to judge what is ""impeding progress"", and players were reluctant to give up hand-check (2) players could still use forearm to ""hand-check"" (3) there was more run-n-gun and less isolation, so tight half-court defense was less frequent (4) during half-court D, tighter perimeter defense was not as important as in later days because players' shooting range was still limited; sagging off to pack the paint was a better option to stop baskets, and hand-check below free-throw line was allowed

- With the above 3 changes and the ever-relaxing officiating on palming, players started to develop their dribble penetration and isolation skills, leading to next era's heavy reliance on isolation. 

- In 81, 1 bonus FT was eliminated, i.e. 3-to-make-2FT became just 2FT, and 2-to-make-1FT became just 1FT. This helped to shorten the overall game time.  Also, backcourt fouls were treated as common foul (i.e. no  more automatic 2FT), which ""allow more defensive pressure in the backcourt"".

*(Does anyone know how 3-to-make-2FT were counted in the stats? I expected a drop either in FTA or FT% depending on how the FT was counted, but the change was insignificant in both stat... )*


\- Other observations -

- Union negotiation and collective bargaining agreement (CBA) had big impact to team rosters:

  - **""Free"" agency was introduced in 1976**. Option clause were finally eliminated. However, the free agency is still not very free: 
    
	- Teams have ""right of first refusal"", i.e. all are restricted free agents.
	
	- Compensation rule: The team signing the ""free"" agent was required to give the old team some compensation ""determined by the NBA Commissioner"". (That's how Lakers got 1979 #1 pick to draft Magic Johnson, by allowing Jazz to sign their vet Gail Goodrich.) 
  
  - **Salary cap** was introduced in 1983. This restricted big market teams from stacking stars and helped parity. It was a soft salary cap, so teams could still go above salary cap to re-sign their own players. There was no luxury tax yet.
    
  - Teams reacted by giving their young superstar (1) long extension contacts (e.g. Magic 25yr extension in 1981) (2) long rookie contracts (Ewing 10yr contract in 1985) to lock their whole career up. That's why discussion on ""Loyalty"" was still non-existent; many superstars were simply under contract until they passed their prime. 
   
- Starting with new Commissioner  David Stern in 1984, NBA gave lots of effort to market their current superstars (Magic, Bird, Jordan, etc.). They started dunk contest and 3pt shootout in All-Star games. They modernized the arenas, got TV broadcast deals and promotional tie-ins. The marketing was very successful - fans fell in love with the NBA stars from 80s onwards (while retired NBA stars before 80s further dimmed in contrast). 

- Since 60s, the average weight of players were around 205lb. In 80s, the **average weight started to increase** (until 2010s). Players had better training & nutrition and bulked up. Athleticism in the league greatly increased. 

- **Lottery draft** started in 1985 to combat tanking (a futile attempt).

- The league finally gave awards for Defensive Player of the Year (1982), 6th Man of the Year (1982) and Most Improved Player (1985).


## (5) Slow-Pace Isolation Era (1988-2004, 16 seasons)

Notable Superstars: Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, Dominique Wilkins, Clyde Drexler, David Robinson, Patrick Ewing, Reggie Miller, Scottie Pippen, Karl Malone, John Stockton, Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan, Vince Carter, Allen Iverson, Jason Kidd, Chris Webber, Ray Allen, Ben Wallace, etc.

The era was filled with 3-peats and back-to-back by different teams. Chicago and Jordan dominated the mid 90s, while Detroit, Houston, Spurs, and LA Lakers also took turns to shine. 

\- Key differences -

- **Illegal defense rules still in place**
- More restrictions on **hand-checking** (but still exist)
- Number of teams: increased from 25 to 29 in 1995

\- Discussions on evolution of slow pace offense -

While the rules and league format remained the same, the game was evolved to a **slower pace** (from 100 down to 90) and **scoring dropped** significantly  from 109 to 93. Some theories on the cause:

- Detroit Bad Boys used **rough defense** to slow down the great run-and-gun teams and won 2 champs. This inspired other teams to follow their slow-pace, defensive approach.

- More importantly, **effective 3pt shooters had arrived**. In 1989, the average 3P% reached a reasonable 33%. Run-and-gun was no longer the best choice to create space for offense.

- 3 point threats and illegal defense rules created space for half-court offense. Such amount of space in the lane was never seen before, and it greatly favored **isolations** for both low-post and perimeter. Teams played very slow to ensure that all off-ball defenders were dragged elsewhere, then the superstar player can showcase their isolation skill against their helpless defender. 

- **Pick-and-roll**, which is like a 2-man ""isolation"", also became very useful with the increased spacing in the lane. 

- **More restrictions on hand-checking rules were made** between 1994-2000. In 1994 *""Hand-checking eliminated from the end line in the backcourt to the opposite foul line.""* In 1997 *""A defender will not be permitted to use his forearm to impede the progress of an offensive player who is facing the basket in the frontcourt.""* In 2000 *""No contact with either hands or forearms by defenders except in the frontcourt below the free throw line extended in which case the defender may use his forearm only.""* The league wanted less ugly D, less contact, less holding and grabbing to open up offense. With higher degree of freedom, perimeter superstars ISO were further favored. 

- **Rules of palming and carrying was very relaxed**. From Tim Hardaway to Iverson, players could get away with having palms on the side of the ball (or even further down). Crossover, behind-the-back, spin-moves and hesitations were used frequently. These allowed the perimeter players to have more control of the ball, giving further advantage to the perimeter ISO. 

The game became very slow, predictable and (arguably) boring. The league tried changing rules to improve scoring, but not effective:

- 3 point line distance was shorted from 23'9"" to 22' in 1994 to improve scoring. However, it backfired and it was restored in 1997. 

- A **5s back-to-basket time limit** was introduced in 1999, aiming at discouraging slow low-post isolation.

- **Time to advance past midcourt was reduced from 10s to 8s** in 1999. It was a good move, but the time saved was still used up by the slow isolation.

(Elimination of illegal defense in 2001 are discussed in next era)

\- Discussions on rules -

- In early 90s, NBA tried hard to improve image by reducing on-court roughness. Flagrant fouls in 1990. Immediate ejection/suspension for throwing punches in 1992. Suspension for cumulative flagrant fouls in 1993. Automatic suspension for leaving bench during fight and stricter rules on taunting in 1994. Players are ""softer"" nowadays mainly because the **league penalized roughness severely**.


\- Other observations -

- **Hack-a-Shaq** revived in late 90s. Possible reasons:
  
  - Favorable conditions for low-post isolations made talented big men with only low-post moves valuable even without shooting range (Shaq); 
	
  - Team valued defensive players and played them heavy minutes despite them having limited shooting range (Ben Wallace);
  
  - The improved effectiveness of half-court offense (about 1.04pt per possession in 2000) made gifting 2FT to a poor FT shooter (say, <50%) a better option than defending normally
  
  - No rule was changed, because usage was limited on just a few players.

- After more NBPA negotiation, the ""right of first refusal"" and ""compensation rule"" was removed in 1988. **Unrestricted free agency** finally achieved, first for veterans in 1988 and for everyone in 1995. In 1998, after lockout, new CBA introduced max salaries, luxury tax and maximum contract length. Team-building became a difficult art and **great teams were difficult to kept long-term due to easier player movements**. ""Dynasty"" was difficult to form...

- ... Meanwhile, any team could suddenly become a contender with successful free agency signings. In particular, **salary cap jumps** or planned cap space clearance let teams have the opportunity to have big money to lure superstars from other teams. e.g. In 1996, cap jumped +44% and Lakers signed Shaq.

- **Draft was reduced to 2 rounds** in 1989 (used to be 10+ rounds until teams run out of prospect). Weighted lottery started in 1990. 

- **Dream Team** in 1992 Olympics inspired players in other countries. International talents gradually improved in coming decades.

- There were again complaints on dilution of talents due to expansion to 29 teams. Demand for talents led to **more high school players and international players being drafted** starting in late 90s.

- NBA improved refereeing by adding a **3rd referee** in 1988. 

- In 1988, All-NBA team expanded to 3 teams and All-Rookie teams expanded to 2 teams to match with the increased number of players.


## (6) Small Ball and Analytics Era (2004-, 15+ seasons)

*As with any history topic, discussion on current era is always incomplete. The era might even have already ended due to an event or person whose significance is not recognized today yet.*

Notable Superstars: LeBron James, Dirk Nowitzki, Dwyane Wade, Chris Paul, Steve Nash, Paul Pierce, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Carmelo Anthony, Pau Gasol, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose, ~~Kawhi Leonard~~ etc.

Another period of parity. Lakers, Celtics, Spurs, Miami, Cleveland and Golden State had periods of dominance. Golden State, in particular, has chance of longevity unseen since the start of true free agency.

\- Discussions on rules -

The league finally improves the flow of the game successfully by allowing zone D:

- **Illegal defense rules was eliminated** in 2001, thus allowing zone defense. Isolation (especially low-post) is no longer effective due to better help defense. 

- **Faster pace** started to regain popularity to counter the improved half court defense, especially in light of the success of Phoenix Suns in mid 2000s.

The average score improved from 93 to 106 and the pace improved from 90 to 97.

- Stringent **elimination of hand-check and *body-check*** in 2004. This allows perimeter (small) players, especially PG, to have an easier time creating and penetrating. Defenders could no longer rely on strength, brute force and body bump to hinder perimeter plays; long wingspan, speed/athleticism and skills became more important for perimeter defenders.

- Enforcement on **palming is now very relaxed**. We can see palming with *hands near the bottom of the ball* not whistled, allowing almost complete control of the ball during each dribble. In particular, **tall perimeter players** are benefited greatly, who otherwise would have been more susceptible to being stolen by smaller defenders.

- Enforcement on traveling also have always been not very stringent. In fact, in 2009, NBA has relaxed traveling rules to allow easier officiating, **allowing gather-step, step, step**. This made euro-step moves and step-back jumpers much more effective and used extensively.

- Ironically, despite the better shooting from big men (discussed below), **hack-a-Shaq** becomes more common. The league reacted by extending the away-from-the-ball foul penalty to final 2 minutes of *each quarter* in 2016.

- Starting in 2002, **referees are allowed to use instant replays** to improve officiating.

\- Discussions on analytics -

- In 2000s, data **analytics** gained importance. Simply put, teams gathered lots of new data (e.g. Synergy/SportsVU/Sportsradar) and use statistics to evaluate team, make roster changes and form strategies. Some of the impacts include:

  - Teams put **more emphasis on 3 pointers** as it is considered more efficient (1.09pt/shot) than mid-range 2-point shots (0.8pt/shot). 3 pointers attempts increased from 15/gm in 2004 to 29/gm in 2018.
    
  - Teams love **long wingspans** players who defend these efficient shots well. 
  
  - Agile big men who can defend perimeter, run inside to protect the rim, ""switch everything"" and have 3-point range become valuable. ""Traditional"" big men who are tall and heavy with only low-post game become obsolete. Center's average height actually dropped since 2000.  
  
  - Great teams are filled with capable shooters in 2010s. Defenders are drawn out to defend 3-point shots. Space created in paint makes **isolation** viable again.
  
  - **Resting stars** is more common to keep stars fresh. NBA reacted in 2017 by reducing back-to-back and four-in-five-nights.
  
\- Discussions on free agency -
  
- This is the **golden era of free agency**. 90s star with super-long contracts retired. Current players have max contract length of 5-7, leading to lots of free agents each year. Max. salaries and luxury tax reduce the financial incentives for players to stay with the same team and vice versa. Amount of player movement is unprecedented.
  
- An important aspect of this era is that **players have better control of their careers**. They are *free* to make their own career decisions, whether for maximizing financial gain, for winning/achievement, for family/stability or for their 'brand'. In fact, star players' career decisions have as much (or arguably more) impact to team-building as team management: 

  - Free agency allow veterans who can still contribute to sign with good teams hoping to **chase rings**. This may involve a pay-cut (e.g. Drexler in 94, Richmond in 01, Malone & Payton in 03, etc.)
  
  - Star players (or even starter-level players) frequently find themselves able to join/form a good team but hindered by the salary cap & luxury tax. Some stars opt to take **pay-cut** to increase the chance of winning (Duncan in 12, Nowitzki in 14, Durant in 16). Huge **endorsement deal** of stars, which start appearing in 90s and boomed in 2000s, help alleviate such pay-cut decisions. 
  
  - Superteams have always been common in the history of the league. However, **player-initiated superteams** are new phenomenon, simply because the stars finally have control on their own career. As a result, ""loyalty"" of players and teams are more heavily discussed.
  
  - Team results can change abruptly year-by-year due to signing or losing free agents, especially for years with salary cap jumps. 
    
\- Other observations -

- There is an influx of talented **international players**. Talent level in NBA is considered all-time high.

- Meanwhile, more NBA players (who can still perform but somehow unwanted) went to play in overseas league, notably the Chinese Basketball Associations.

- **Flopping** seems to be more frequent in current era. Possible reasons:

	- Better instant replay exposes flops. Instant replays now have multiple angles, zoom, ultra slow-motion, higher definition, and are more ""instant"" than before.
	
	- Flops are easier to sell because there are generally less contact in today's game.
	
	- Not all flops are equal. Some flops are used to sell/exaggerate contacts. The worst flop is to fake contact when there is none. Offenders might have the benefit of doubt before, but today's instant replays completely expose this kind of ugly flops.
	
	- The anti-flopping penalty introduced in 2012 was half-hearted and not effective.
	
- Issues that might have impact to the NBA game and players but current discussion has been inconclusive ^(or I haven't done enough research):

  - NBA draft age limit
  
  - AAU basketball impact to young player development

  - Increased importance of developmental league and two-way contracts
  
- While there is no indication when this current era would end, here's some of my speculation:

  - League nerf the 3 pointers after teams jack 3 pointers all game and the game becomes predictable (similar to the overuse of isolation in 90s)
  
  - Competition of talents by foreign leagues leading to dilution of talents (similar to ABA in 70s)  
  
  - Introduction of 4 point line used in BIG3 (similar to the introduction of 3 point line in 80s) ^(doesn't seem likely tho)

Final words: The game is very different in different eras. It is unwise to compare players across eras without knowing the league rules and settings in each era. In fact, league rules and settings dictate what kind of players that can be successful. Players who dominated the game or ""exploited the rules"" are reasons of rule changes. On the other hand, the first players who take advantage of the change can become the king of the era.",nbadiscussion

1923,928,2018-19 All-NBA Centers: Who gets left out?,"Let's talk All-NBA teams this year.

The 6 forwards are a lock, only the order is up for debate:

Giannis, Paul George, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, Kawhi Leonard, and LeBron James. ""4th team"" to Pascal Siakam and Jimmy Butler.

The 6 guards is a little trickier. I think there's a clear top 4: James Harden, Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, and Stephen Curry. 

The 2 last spots on the 3rd team I think are up for grabs. I think it'll likely be Ben Simmons and Russell Westbrook, but there are strong cases to be made for Mike Conley, Bradley Beal, and Kemba Walker. Westbrook and Simmons have team record to point to, but those other three have been absolutely beasting it trying to carry much weaker rosters.

But anyway, this thread is about the centers, and I have absolutely no clue what to do here.

Nikola Jokic, Rudy Gobert, Karl-Anthony Towns, Joel Embiid, Nikola Vucevic, and Anthony Davis.

First off, let's talk about AD. Anthony Davis has all the advanced and traditional stats as you would expect, but with only 54 out of 72 games played and his minutes way down since the all-star break, he is being taken out of the conversation. If he played more games and 30+ minutes instead of 20-22, he would be in there, but thankfully we can shave this one name off the list to try to get it down to 3.

Secondly, Nikola Vucevic absolutely deserves to be part of this conversation. He is carrying the Magic on his back, 1 game out from the 8th seed to make the playoffs. Posting 20.7/12.1/3.9 with 1 steal and 1 block per game. He's played 70 out of 71 games for the Magic, 27.8% usage. His advanced stats puts him firmly within the pack with those other names.

Jokic is remarkable, he's the best passing center of this or the last few generations. He should finish top 5 in MVP voting and has my vote for All-NBA first team.

Karl-Anthony Towns has been putting up some crazy numbers. Very similar situation to Vucevic where he is solo carrying a bad team. Most years, he's a lock for All-NBA, but this might be the year that the center position is so stacked he's left off.

Rudy Gobert is the most unique of the centers here, no other player here is so much carried by his defense over his offense. The other 5 names have a usage percentage of 27-33. Gobert's is 17.6%. But he's also got the 3rd highest win shares in the league behind Giannis and Harden. He's either going to win or be runner up for Defensive Player of the Year. I really don't know where to slot him in the All-NBA rankings, somewhere between 2nd and 5th.

Joel Embiid represents the biggest disparity between eye test + traditonal stats vs. advanced stats that I know of. He's posting 27.3/13.6/3.5 with 2.0 blocks per game on 33.2% usage. And yet, if you look at advanced stats, he is consistently way off from the pack in [Win Shares](https://i.imgur.com/ap9avFi.png), [Box Plus Minus](https://i.imgur.com/NvY2syC.png), and [Value Over Replacement Player](https://i.imgur.com/URObI5F.png). Just look at those BPM and VORP charts, the other 5 centers I've mentioned are clustered so tightly together but Embiid is way out. This is not something new with Embiid, advanced stats have always been low on him. What accounts for this, and how much weight should you give it when ranking players overall?

So who are your 3 All-NBA centers this year? I think Jokic can't be denied, and even though his advanced stats are bad, I think most people still have Embiid on there somewhere. That leaves 1 spot for KAT, Gobert, or Vucevic. Vucevic and KAT have similar player profiles, and between the two, KAT has the name recognition even if I think statistically they are very close. So do you give it to KAT, or Gobert? I'm not sure. What do you think?",nbadiscussion

1925,930,Buddy Hield isn’t happy. The 76ers need a shake-up. Presti loves picks. This trade addresses all 3.,"So first, a disclaimer. This is a trade idea I found on another forum, not an original thought.


This 3 way trade addresses  a significant problem for two teams, as well as giving the thunder picks and ridding them of CP3s contract. Here’s the idea:


76ers receive: Buddy Hield, Chris Paul, and Harrison Barnes.


Thunder receive: Tobias Harris, 2020 OKC 1st via Philly, 2022 Philly 1st


Kings receive: Josh Richardson, Al Horford, Zhaire Smith, and 3 2020 seconds from the sixers.


My thoughts: i definitely think the thunder and 76ers would do this. The kings might need more incentive to take on Al Horford, but I’m not sure. 


What if instead of Zhaire, Thybulle? Or would the sixers then be giving up too much?


I’d love to see what you guys think of the base trade or if there’s a better version of it out there!",nbadiscussion
1926,931,With the Lakers/Nuggets series getting so much attention can we focus on the chess match between Heat/Celtics....,"####*The Lakers vs Nuggets series is amazing but I think the Heat vs Celtics series is even more delicate and is basically a chess match between Spo and Brad*. 

###What did the heat do so well in GM1 and GM2 that got them the win? What the Celtics do that made them lose?###

> The biggest factor is the **heat playing zone.** They played zone the most in regular season out of any team but didn't play much in the post season. They brought it up this series and it was super effective. 

> The heat use their **forwards for their 2 man part of the zone**: Butler and Crowder. Since they are both lengthy and mobile enough to block the passing lanes and the driving lanes; we saw butler get couple of steals from this. This makes their guards close out faster on shooters. Bam as a safety.

> The **Celtics were seemed super thrown off by the Zone** and went on a cold stretch which allowed the heat to mount a come back. 

> The Heat defense is suffocating and Celtics have a super low margin to get their passes off. **Kemba hasn't been the facilitator the Celtics could needed** and often wasted possession on the clock trying to shake his defender. Saw this several time in the 4th when he was trying to shake off Crowder or Bam and it fails and gives the ball up to Tatum.

> Dragic continued his offensive performance and cooked Thesis on those mismatches. Celtics would switch those PnR with Bam and Dragic. Dragic hit some big shots over the slower center.

###What happed in GM3? How did Celtics adjust and maintained their lead?###

> Brad got Hayward back and I think this added another dimension to his offense and defense. They can now match the Heat small ball lineup and Hayward is another great ball handler and passer. *An interesting bit of stat that I found was that majority of Jaylen Brown's points are assisted by Hayward. (seems like Hayward is better at finding Brown more so than Kemba or Tatum)*

> **The Celtics had Smart on Dragic** and I think this had the intended effect. Dragic shot 2/10 I believe and had much harder time driving and finishing. 

> The **zone has diminishing returns**. In a 7 game series, teams will get comfortable and will figure out how to neutralize it and when you have a coach as good as Brad this was bound to happen. **Celtics also decided to attack faster making it harder for the Heat to set up zone**.

> Jaylen Brown was more active and was **attacking Duncan Robinson. As a matter of fact it seems like Duncan Robinson is who they wanted to attack every time he was on the floor**. 

> **The heat seemed tired?** From the tip off they just weren't as sharp mentally and Boston wasn't going to give up a lead 3 games in a row. 

> **The heat switch because they are so mobile.** Bam did a great job on Kemba when he was switched on and **Celtics are using this to their advantage.** They are switching Bam on to Kemba and with their best rim protector OUT of the PAINT. This allows their guards to attack easier. 


###What can we expect in GM5 from both teams?

> Brad is going to **continue putting Smart on Dragic**; although who starts on a player doesn't matter much as players are switched depending on the possession but this might make Dragic more weary on attacking Smart as opposed to Kemba.

> Spo might resort to **using Zone less**, might bring it on when the Celtics bench is in. They might try to trap Kemba when he tries to get Bam switched on to him  allowing Bam enough time to protect the paint.

> I can see **Jimmy being more aggressive**; they need another player outside of Dragic who is willing to drive and attack the paint. Herro was doing this but Jimmy needs to attack Kemba and look to finish through contact. 

>  **Heat needs to limit fast break points**. There was a stretch where Brown and Tatum both played good defense and threw the ball ahead for quick buckets. This could be avoided by better passing. 

> **Brad might go small to combat Bam**, Brown is amazing defender and might be able to hang in there with bam. Especially if Bam doesn't take advantage of that smaller players in the post. **Celtics would have all 5 players who can drive, dribble, and shoot.**


**Super interested in how Spo adjusts for GM4. Whoever win this game is going to have a huge momentum and could close out the series. If the Heat make the right adjustments and win the game the celtics would have to win 3 in a row...If the Celtics win and neutralize the Heat's adjustments they have huge momentum.....**",nbadiscussion

Another team with really some great wing depth, Joe Johnson, Pierce, PG13 are a really strong starting trio offensively, all great shooters who can also take their defenders off the dribble. The spacing for this starting lineup is great, 4 really good shooters who demand respect from 3. I thought pretty hard about having Lopez in the starting lineup to really maximize shooting, but Horace Grant's defensive ability swung me (although Brook is a perfectly capable defender, especially in the post). All in all this starting lineup is really deadly and has the potential to give a lot of the stronger teams we've seen so far some serious problems.

With all that said I can't help but feel like the coaching for this hypothetical team would be really, really crucial. I can fairly easily envision this offense falling into an iso heavy, your shot then my shot offense. Grant doesn't need touches on offense, and is a fine screener, which does help. PG13 might relish the opportunity to be a shooter (who would get wide open looks) and focus all of his energy on the defensive end and Jason Terry was able to coexist as the second fiddle to Dirk, but without a true distributor this offense could get bogged down. With that said the spacing that this starting 5 provides probably makes up for the lack of a true distributor.

A few thoughts when constructing the roster

****

Not a ton of guys who I really agonized over excluding them. Sine notable names include *Erick Dampier, Lindsey Hunter, Brandon Jennings, Johnny ""Pooh"" Dawkins (weird), Justise Winslow, Austin Rivers, Elfrid Payton, Jeyon Dooling, and Spencer Hawes*. I did have Jennings in over Pooh Richardson, but Pooh might be a slightly worse 3 pt shooter, but he's better defensively and is just a better player. It is still weird to me though that this team could have had two guys named ""Pooh""

Lopez and Bynum both have cases to start over Grant. Like I mentioned earlier Lopez's shooting ability with the rest of the starters is a really intriguing proposition. The additional spacing he would provide would allow JJ, Pierce, and PG13 to go to the rim with little opposition. Not to mention that Lopez is a stout post defender who can at least make some of the elite centers in this field work for their buckets. Bynum is such a weird, sad story. He's still only 31 and hasn't played basketball in 4 years. In his last, somewhat, healthy season he averaged 18.7/11.8 with 1.9 blocks a game. If he was able to stay healthy, and somewhat normal, he would be the starter here. Ultimately Grant's defensive presence and ability to be an effective player without the ball won me over.

Eddie Jones, McCollum, and Butler are all great depth off the bench. I suppose Pooh Richardson could be the PG with the bench unit, but I'm sure that McCollum would be able to be an effective primary ball handler. Butler and Eddit Jones are pretty similar players (with the 3 being a larger part of Jones' game) and can both be leading scoring options with bench units.

****

This team is flawed for sure, but a lot of fun and really talented. A combo of Grant, Thomas, Lopez, and Bynum are great bodies who can be thrown at some of the larger teams in the field. They're all big and strong and should be able to hold their own. Lopez might be the key piece to this team with his shooting ability, which would allow a supersized lineup of JJ, PG13, Pierce, Horace Grant, and Lopez. Like the #9 team the wing depth of this team is exceptional. This team doesn't have the same creators on the wing like the #9 team, but they do have 5 wings who can put up points. Guard play is lacking, Pooh Richardson is fine I guess, but McCollum and Terry are both great offensive players. I do worry about the defensive limitations by the guards on this team, the #4 team with Westbrook and CP3 would eat these guards alive, which would put more pressure on the wings and the bigs to contain penetration.

I really like the potential of this team, I don't see them winning the whole tournament, but they can advance pretty far if the right matchups fall into place

1928,933,What rookies are you most excited about?,"Besides the main rookies (young, doncic, ayton) what rookies do you think have the best futures in the league? 

For me id have to pick Mitchell Robinson, C for the knicks. Ive been high on him since he was drafted because of his size and presence on defense and he more than proved that he is going to be a force in this league for years to come. Mikal Bridges would be a close second for me because of his production on the defensive end (1.6 steals per game)",nbadiscussion
1929,934,Which Conference was better in the 90s?," 

I've heard the East was a better conference than the west but looking bball reference it seems that the west had the advantage. I wasn't born yet so here's my take:

Looking at the teams Jordan played in the ECF: Pistons, Cavs, Knicks, Orlando, Heat, Pacers

Finals: Lakers, Blazers, Suns, Sonics, Jazz, Jazz

Who wins: Lakers over pistons in 5, Blazers over cavs in 6, Jazz over heat and pacers both in 6

Toss up: Knicks and suns in 93, Orlando and sonics in 96

I feel as if the west had at least 3 teams back then that could win a title rather the east just have 1 other team rather than Jordan win it in certain years.

Please do enlighten me if I'm wrong.",nbadiscussion

Welcome back to the (un)official reddit player rankings of the 2019 offseason!

I checked on the poll results from yesterday and I have less than 50 votes so I'm back, requesting for more people to vote. There are currently ties that need to be resolved so please vote so we have a clearer picture of who the next five players to be ranked are. If you can, please vote in the following form: https://forms.gle/tSd7AqKK3cHkparc9.

In the meantime, use the comment sections to discuss who should be a part of the next five or to evaluate the current rankings (is anybody too low/high?).

Once again, a reminder that this ranking is **reflective.** We are primarily basing these rankings off the 2018-2019 season and playoffs and how each player performed specifically during that time.

I'll report back with the results at around the same time tomorrow and hopefully finally move on to 36-40.

We've all heard the criticism: ""He had 22 points, but took 22 shots to get there."" But why is that so bad? 

This has been a common knock on players' performances since before Moreyball was as emphasized as it is now, so I'm not sure it can be attributed to the lack of 3s. Perhaps the lack of FTs, but I'm still curious to hear what you guys think. My only thought is that it's pretty rare for perimeter players shoot that many times exclusively from 2.

1937,942,Who makes final two out west?,"I think top six in no order Lakers, Clippers, Jazz,  nuggets, Rockets, and Blazers. Final two is up for grabs. Team in contention fmo are GS, SA, Kings, Mavs, and honestly Wolves.

  I think GS will be weaker but I think people over low that their roster is like a G-league team. If you take out Curry, Dray, D lo, Looney; Burks, WCS, Chriss, and GR3 have been rotation players in the NBA. Alec Burks was a longtime Jazz and has had playoff experience. If they can contribute eight he starters, GS can still be decent. If other young guys do well too it can a decent bench. If Gs can get sixth I wouldn’t count them out of anything. I take them at 7.

  Eight will be a three way tie cause I like the spurs as a team or more respect. I know they have the streak for longest playoff streak. But for me it’s a three way tie with Kong’s, Spurs, and Wolves.

  I honestly think Wolves might be good. KAT looks good and I think their depth might be alright. Layman was decent in Portland and guys like Okogie might make an impact. Maybe Wiggins moves to the bench and he can be a good sixth man. If they make a trade for a another scorer they can actually be a playoff team. I think the Mavs and Pelicans are a bit overrated. They have high talent but its kind of young and the Mavs for me have a shitty bench.",nbadiscussion

1939,944,(4) Boston Celtics versus (5) Indiana Pacers,"So, how should this playoff series play out?

I did a quick skim over the team stats and Indiana ranks highly in all defensive metrics, but they have issues scoring the ball. Boston, on the other hand, are at least comparable defensively and can at least score points and have a lot more flexibility in their line-ups.

I think how the Turner/Young match-up performs versus Horford, and whoever Stevens thinks is a nice complement to Horford will be a key thing to look for. The series is likely to be a long defensive slugfest. Am I right in my assessment?",nbadiscussion
1940,945,Three team Anthony Davis Trade with Portland and Philadelphia,"Pelicans receive:  CJ McCollum, Jusuf Nurkic, Markelle Fultz, Zach Collins, Amir Johnson, Nik Stauskas and Philly and Portland 2019 unprotected 1sts.

Trailblazers receive:  Anthony Davis, Etuwan Moore, Wilson Chandler and Mike Muscala

Sixers receive:  Jrue Holiday and Julius Randle.

&#x200B;

This trade would leave New Orleans with the quartet of CJ/Nurkic/Collins/Fultz as the only 4 players under contract going into 2020.  With 3 first round picks and plenty of cap space, New Orleans could anticipate a faster rebuild than most with solid decision making.

Portland can roll the dice with Dame and AD while they are in their primes under contract and add even more talent with the increased cap space they would see in the upcoming offseason.

Philadelphia gets two extremely athletic guys that would be perfect fits with their roster and make them a formidable foe to anyone in the league.

1941,946,All Time Team: Toronto Raptors,"Hey all, long time lurker, first time poster here. I love the quality, in-depth basketball analysis in this subreddit! Inspired by u/mdicke3's All Time draft position teams, I have decided to start my own hypothetical project: All Time NBA teams.

The rules are simple: you can use any season that the player played for the team, but you can only use each player once. So, no army of LeBrons patrolling the perimeter for Miami (although that would make for another fun hypothetical discussion too!) They don't have to have played the whole season, and yes, I chose that rule so I could ensure Marc Gasol quarterbacks the defence. Only took a couple months for him to be an all timer in my eyes! But, anyhow, in all seriousness, if the player played for two teams the season that you select them, you take the statistics accrued in the part of the season they played with the team. Multiple teams can take the same player, this is a hypothetical best team your team could yield.

Anyways, I don't have the time or knowledge to do every other team but I would love to read them, so if someone else wants to do one of their favourite teams later this week, that would be pretty cool! In the meantime, without further ado, I give you my all time Toronto Raptors.

**Point Guard: Kyle Lowry 2015-2016**

As easy a decision as this is to pick Lowry, deciding on the year was monumentally tough. Which version do you pick? 2015-2016 was third team All-NBA and easily the best defensively, with 2.1 steals and 3.7 defensive win shares a game. It was also his most impressive by a number of advanced calculations like BPM and VORP. However, during 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 Lowry reached another level shooting the ball, posting career high eFg%s of .569 and .553 respectively. And of course, while the most recent incarnation saw a dramatic drop off in usage and is a step slower, 2018-2019 is undoubtedly the wisest and most confident the Bay Street Bulldog has ever looked.

All that said though, I chose the 2015-2016 version. As the say, at the end of the day, defence wins championships, and this version of Lowry has another gear locking in individually that isn't there anymore. Also, while his shooting numbers wouldn't have matched the next two seasons either way, it's worth noting that his playoff percentages would have been way higher if he was healthier! Elbow bursitis is no joke. While I would have loved to get the clutch version I saw down the stretch this year, I'm confident that if this Kyle was getting those looks in Game 6 he would have buried them too. Last but certainly not least, let's not forget this is the only version of Kyle to have ever beaten Lebron in the playoffs (even if it just was a couple games).

**Shooting Guard: Vince Carter 2000-2001**

This one wasn't so tough. Vince Carter averaged 27.6 points per game on an 51 percent effective field goal percentage, including a scintillating 41% from deep. He also averaged 4 assists, 5.5 boards, 1.5 steals and a block a game. With Kawhi taking the bigger, stronger wing threat, Carter can chase around a shooter and focus on scoring.

**Small Forward: Kawhi Leonard 2018-2019**

The most obvious pick, Kawhi would obviously be the lynchpin of this team. With Lowry, Carter, (spoilers!) Bosh, and Gasol spacing the floor, defenses will be hard pressed to find a solution for Kawhi. Between his brute strength and shooting mastery from all over the court, very few teams will have a player equipped to handle No. 2 one on one. Defensively, he's a game changer; able to match up against the Lebrons, MJs and Larry Birds of the tournament.

**Power Forward: Chris Bosh 2006-2007**

Despite Bosh's obvious excellence, this was a bit of a tough pick. I considered shifting him to Center and slotting Pascal in here to create a quicker team with a little more three point range. Although Bosh developed into an excellent 3 point shooting centre with the Heat, during his tenure with the Raptors he he never really shot many threes. Furthermore, beyond spacing not being ideal, his favourite place to go to work is the high left post...which also happens to be Marc Gasol's favourite spot to direct traffic and make plays. While he was a relatively willing passer during his years here, the ball never really hummed when he had it, and him and Kawhi could potentially turn into a laborious ""your turn, my turn"" dynamic that wouldn't get the most out of their talents. Despite all that, I still think Bosh is the clear cut starting Power Forward. Having him at Center just won't work in this tournament; there are too many hulking centers that would score in the paint and probably run him into foul trouble. So that's out. However, while he is a little small for the 5 against some of these guys, his defence at the 4 with someone marginally competent beside him would be downright scary. And while he wouldn't necessarily space the floor out to the three point line, Gasol can, and Bosh was absolute money from midrange.

I ended up going with the 2006-2007 version because that season seemed to be more impressive than his later campaigns from defense and rebounding perspective. Both DWS and DBPM peg it as his most successful defensive campaign after his rookie season (which is an interesting tidbit in and of its own right but probably a topic for another day). It was undoubtedly his most successful Raptors season from a team perspective, despite primarily sharing the court with such luminaries as TJ Ford, Anthony Parker, Jorge Garbajosa, and Rasho Nesterovic. I have nothing but love for these guys, especially TJ and Garbo with their tragic injuries, but they aren't who you expect to see manning a 47 win team. He had slightly better offensive campaigns the next couple years, but all take the guy who got a second team All NBA nod over KG.

**Center: Marc Gasol 2018-2019**

Marc Gasol's numbers are underwhelming-9 points, 6.5 boards, 4 assists during the tailend of the regular season he spent in Toronto, followed up by an, on paper, even less impressive 9.4, 6.4 and 3. On paper, that is. Anyone who watched the games this offseason saw just how valuable his defense was. Advanced stats back this up. His DBPM of 4.3 in the playoffs matched his previous playoff career high that he set during his 2012-2013 Defensive Player of the Year campaign and almost matched his 2012-2013 regular season of 4.4 His Defensive Win Shares blow every other season he has had out of the water. And offensively, forget everything he does for spacing, there isn't another big man on the potential roster even close to his passing ability. He's a no brainer for this spot, even if guys like AD or JV have gaudier rebounds and points. Gasol gives you a chance against the Shaqs, Kareems, and Wilts who will be starring for other teams with storied pasts.

**6th Man: DeMar DeRozan 2017-2018**

I have always thought that DeMar's best chance to have a successful career is to embrace a Manu role on a team (interestingly, I have thought this since long before the trade). His inability to either lock in defensively or stretch the floor make him somewhat of a liability whenever he doesn't touch the ball. But he is excellent with it. Like, very excellent. This version of DeMar was so excellent with the ball that despite those flaws, he finished 8th in MVP voting and earned second team All-NBA honours. 2017-2018 DeMar DeRozan took a leap as a playmaker that would make him perfectly suited to come in off the bench and attack defenses. Despite being a phenomenal athlete in his own right, he is clearly in a league behind Vince and Kawhi- no shame in that, they are two of the craziest freak athletes in the world! However, most teams will have starters with that extra notch of athleticism and coming off the bench would allow DeMar to go to work against guys he can beat.

**Back-Up PG: Fred Van Vleet Sr. 2018-2019**

I might catch some heat for this one, and maybe I am falling victim to recency bias. There are other contenders for this spot, for sure. Jose Calderon's 2007-2008 season was only 16 free throws shy of joining the 50-40-90 club and dwarfs FVV's regular season by any offensive statistical measure. Even in the playoffs, his numbers don't look very impressive because he started slow. But after his wife gave birth to his son, Fred Van Vleet Jr., FVV put up a blistering 9 game stretch where he scored 15 PPG on 51% from the field and 52% from 3 while clinching an NBA championship. While it's unrealistic to expect FVV to sustain that level of production, his tenacious defense and Curry-esque range give him the edge here. I worry that he won't be able to be as effective a defender against many of the guards he will face in this tournament as he was against Steph, but it's not like Calderon would fair much better against a Gary Payton or a Jason Kidd anyhow. And I think we can all agree that as masterful a job as Calderon would do with the second unit, he would be a liability against the small quick scorers that FVV excels against.

**Back-Up Wing: Danny Green 2018-2019**

This was a tough one. Doug Christie put up a great season in 1996-1997, playing his usual excellent defence and adding 4.7 threes on 38% accuracy. T-Mac averaged 2 blocks a game along with 15, 6 and 3. Anthony Parker had a solid three year stretch but had no season as impressive on either end as Green did this year. And sure, he wasn't as consistent as Danny either, but Mo Pete made the coolest shots ever. In the end, nobody had a season that combined shooting and defense like Danny Green did this year. He shot a scorching .632 TS% and played excellent defense all year, often taking the toughest assignment with Kawhi resting frequently. Despite his poor playoff showing shooting the rock, he earned this spot.

**Back-Up Forward: Pascal Siakam 2018-2019**

This is an easy pick. Siakam's 17 PPG on an elite .591 eFG% along with excellent defense earned him Most Improved Players hardware this season, and it also notched him solidly ahead of guys like Antonio Davis, Amir Johnson, and Serge for the backup forward role. He can sub in for either one of forwards and immediately provide a change of pace to Bosh and Leonard's more methodical styles. Pascal's run outs are always impactful, but as we saw the season before, him getting out in transition against benches is extra deadly. Defensively, he fits in with the long, switch happy scheme that worked in the playoffs.

**Back-Up Centre: Marcus Camby 1997-1998**

Marcus Camby may not have developed into future defensive player of the year yet, but he lead the league with 3.7 blocks that year! Truth be told, I didn't realize just how good Camby  was when we traded him for Oakley, and now that I'm looking at his numbers I'm beginning to get a little upset. He posted 12 points, 7.5 boards, a steal and 2 assists a game in addition to shot blocking. I was tempted to put Serge in here for spacing and chutzpah, but young Camby is just in another league protecting the rim.

**3rd PG: Damon Stoudamire 1996-1997**

I can't imagine sulking Stoudamire would be thrilled backing up a player as unaccomplished as FVV but it is what it is. For all their physical similarities, present day FVV grades out way higher in DBPM, finishing -0.7 in the regular season and 0.4 in the playoffs. Raptors era Stoudamire never finished higher than -2.1. Now, some of this is the players around you, and without a doubt, FVV has had the luxury of playing with all world defenders. But, I just don't think I could plug a guy who is that much of a liability defensively into the backup role in this tournament. Even DeMar has never dropped below -1.9 on the season. However, I can totally take a 20 and 9 guy as my third string guy. If the matchups played out, Damon would be a huge boon off the bench, bringing instant offense and creativity. However, I worry that with FVV on the team, he already might end up redundant, with more of his time going to...

**12th Man: Tracy McGrady 1999-2000**

Obviously there's a couple versions of T-Mac out there not buried on the bench. But 20 year old Raptors McGrady isn't one of them. He had a good year, but not super noteworthy. As mentioned earlier, he averaged 15-6-3-2, which is a nice well rounded contribution. But more importantly, he is an elite athlete. In case of injury trouble, I would rather have a young McGrady filling in for Kawhi trying to guard all timers than some of the less athletically gifted guys guarding LBJ. He also has some ball handling skills and could fill in as a back up PG against bigger guards. As much as I considered my own personal childhood hero Alvin Williams for the spot, he just wasn't the same caliber of athlete as McGrady

**IR: Jose Calderon 2007-2008, Jonas Valanciunas 2018-2019, Donyell Marshall 2003-2004**

With all due respect to TJ Ford, who was a great playmaker and had a real shot to be a special player before Al Horford accidentally derailed his career, the IR PG spot is Jose's to lose. In addition to being a stellar shooter, he is a great leader who would have absolutely no problem not making the rotation. JV provides another big body if Marc or Marcus go down and some great offence if needed. Although he saw a down tick in minutes, his per36 stats were great before getting traded this year (and obviously continued to be down the stretch for Memphis too). Last but certainly not least, Marshall averaged 16 and 10 on 40% 3 point shooting. I really am strongly considering putting him in the rotation, but I just don't know who to take out. He's not quite as valuable and versatile as Green or McGrady defensively, even if he was a better scorer than both (while Raptors). For now, he stays on the IR.

**Coach: Nick Nurse 2018-2019**

This pick may not age well, but as of right now, I don't think anyone else even is a candidate. Nurse just won a championship in his first season as a head coach. The real challenge is next year, but as of right now, you can't argue with results.

&#x200B;

Anyways, that's my team! I am still mulling whether or not Alvin Williams or Oakley's toughness should be included, but hopefully, Kyle and Marc can take care of that for us. Hope you enjoyed the read, and please, discuss away!",nbadiscussion

1943,948,The false narrative about how Dominique Wilkins returned to his previous old self after his Achilles injury.,"Before I start, I take  absolutely nothing away from how amazing Wilkins was in his comeback season.

During 1990-91 season, Wilkins averaged 25.9 points on 55.0 TS% while playing 81 regular season games.

In the following season, a 32-year-old Wilkins suffered a season ending Achilles injury after playing only 42 games.

When Wilkins returned for 1992-93 season, he avg. 29.9 ppg on 55.0 TS% while playing 71 regular season games.

From what I know, he's the only superstar player in NBA history to be as brilliant as pre-Achilles injury.

I'll always have tremendous respect for this man.


-------


Having that said.... **Dominique Wilkins never returned to his previous old self.**

People don't realize that pre-Achilles injured Wilkins was a skywalker & his athleticism was off the chart.

In his comeback, Wilkins reinvented himself as a three-point shooter. From almost exclusively being viewed as a high-fly act, Wilkins went from shooting 105 three-pointers in 1988-1989 to shooting 316 of them (1992-1993). 2 seasons after his injury, Wilkins shot a career-high 38.8% from beyond the arc. That's why he could continue to produce from shooting instead of just relying on his athleticism. 

Kobe Bryant for example, already known as a great three-point shooter, wasn't able to surprise defenders by pulling up from the outside anymore, as defenders expected expect him to do just that.

Wilkins in his own words:

>“What the tear does,” he continued, “is force you to play on the ground. You aren’t in the air as much. You become more fundamentally sound. It’s almost like the game slows down in your mind a little bit. And it’s funny, because before the injury, I didn’t really like shooting from outside. I liked attacking the rim, using my quickness to score or get into the paint and find open teammates. But you adjust, and Rudy (Gay) will adjust.""

It's absolutely crazy that the Jazz have been as efficient on offense as arguably the most efficient offensive player in NBA history in his prime.

What I'm thinking is that there should be two all time NBA rankings.  
  
The first one is for **greatest careers.**  The key thing here about greatest careers is that it factors in accolades and championship success. This would benefit someone like Bill Russell who was a key player on 11 championship teams. However his ability might not rank him as highly despite him still being top 10 alltime.  
  
The second one is for **greatest ability/peak.** The key thing here about greatest ability/peak is that it factors in simply the individual players ability. This could highly rank players such as Tracy McGrady who were very skilled but were stuck on bad teams.

A lot of people, such as myself, thought it was ridiculous but before I could even blink, the narrative started to shift and all of a sudden, people began to make it seem like it was a close, competitive race when just 1 week before the Lakers' victories many were contemplating giving the award to Giannis *unanimously*. 

But alas, some people think that this is a close race. And with all respect to LeBron, it's not. Giannis blows him out of the water defensively and has similar offensive metrics. In terms of impact, it's the same picture being painted for the defensive side. See for yourself down below: 

**Defense**

Statistic | Antetokounmpo | James
---------|----------|----------
DBPM | 4.1 | 1.9
DPIPM | 4.5 | 1.9
D-RAPTOR | 4.0 | 1.1
DRPM | 2.7 | 1.9
DRTG | 96.5 | 103.0
DWS | 4.8 | 3.4
On-Off | -7.7 | -3.6

Defensivley, it's not even close. In every imaginable advanced defensive metric, Giannis emerges victoriously. There isn't a single defensive metric I could find that LeBron has the lead in. 

Giannis thoroughly dominates LeBron in this regard and almost none of their respective metrics are close. That's not to say LeBron is a bad defender, but Giannis has been historically great this season defensively. 

**Offense**

Statistic | Antetokounmpo | James
---------|----------|----------
OBPM | 7.9 | 6.8
O-PIPM | 4.5 | 4.2
O-RAPTOR | 5.3 | 6.7
ORPM | 7.1 | 6.1 
ORTG | 112.6 | 113.3
OWS | 5.6 | 6.1
On-Off | 4.4 | 8.1

In this regard, LeBron got the slight edge in most of their advanced offensive metrics. Giannis still has him beat in a couple of metrics or at the very least, is within close range. 

Regardless, LeBron gets the edge here. He's been phenomenal this season. But it's a slight edge and unfortunately it's not enough to make for the universe-sized gap Giannis has on LeBron defensively. 

**Impact**

Statistic | Antetokounmpo | James
---------|----------|----------
BPM | 11.5 | 8.7
NET | 12.0 | 11.7
PER | 31.6 | 26.0
PIPM | 9.0 | 6.1
RAPTOR | 9.2 | 7.7
RPM | 9.8 | 8.0
VORP | 6.0 | 5.7
WAR | 11.0 | 11.2
WS | 10.4 | 9.5
WS-48 | .282 | .218

And just like their defense this season, their impact stats aren't close either. Every impact stat favors Giannis. In every impact stat I could possibly find, Giannis was always ahead. He's been dominant, simply put.

So there you have it. There isn't a sound argument for LeBron capturing his 5th Most Valuable Player award, at least not in a statistical sense. And these aren't even all of the advanced numbers I could find. I just wanted to make a relatively quick post about this whole MVP conversation.",nbadiscussion

**Devin Booker**

Teams that could make a compelling trade

Knicks, Magic, Detroit, Nuggets, Timberwolves, Spurs (maybe), Pelicans

**Karl Anthony Towns**

Knicks, Hawks, Celtics, Spurs (again maybe)

**Bradley Beal**

Hawks, Magic, Detroit, Nuggets, Pelicans, Spurs (once again, maybe).

The reason there are big maybe's for the **Spurs** are because they'd most likely have to give up at least 2 of Murray, White, Walker. Not sure how much the Wizards, Wolves, Suns, would value them. But outside of that, the Spurs don't have any superstars on the team. Derozan and Aldridge are all star caliber players but i wouldn't call them superstars. KAT would be the perfect person to build around if they can keep Derrick White as i see White as someone who will be around the Borderline All Star level in the future.

**Knicks** would be smarter to trade for Booker or KAT but not Beal simply for the fact that they're younger. They'll fit with the timeline and still have room to grow. Beal is 26 and fits a team more established that needs that player to push them forward. If i'm the Knicks, when trading for them, everyone besides RJ Barrett and the 2019 pick is on the table. RJ is their prospect that has the highest upside imo. Mitchell Robinson is good but its hard to see him as anything more than a rim running defensive player. the 2019 pick should be off limits due to the teams desperate need for a PG. the picks from 2020 on as well as dallas picks should still be good enough.

**Hawks** skip out on Booker but can take a look at at Towns and Beal. Booker seems like he'd be more ball dominant and that would clash with how Young plays. Also that back court defense would be horrible. Young/Towns pick and roll, pick and pop would be stupid good. Basically if i'm the Hawks and look to trade for Towns, everyone besides Young is on the table. Beal fits them imo because i feel there one Trae Young break out season shy of the playoffs. They'd be a nutty shooting back court.

**Detroit** and the **Magic** are in the same boat due to their needs for dynamic guard play. Both teams have good front courts but they're back courts need serious upgrades. I feel Detroit can benefit more from Beal due to Jackson's ball dominant nature. The Magic can benefit more from Booker due to his ability create plays for others.

I have the **Timberwolves** on the list for Booker because outside of KAT they don't have any other super dynamic players. Trading for Booker gets complicated though. Because it would require significant assets. Once they use up those assets for Booker they'll have nothing to attach to an Andrew Wiggins trade if they try to get rid of him. If they use the assets to drop Wiggins, then they can't get Booker. It gets tricky. I say they're best chance at Booker is if someone trades for Beal, then the Wizards look to ship off Wall. They could probably send out Wiggins and something small for Wall. Wall would still probably give them 16 and 7 after injury. Although hes a similarly bad contract (maybe worse). He'd be a better player and i'd trust a Wall, Booker, Kat team over one with Wiggins on it.

**Nuggets** are on this list only if they feel that Jamal Murray and Harris aren't going to cut it. Not going to go super in depth with them because i'm one of those if it aint broke dont fix it kinda guys. Nuggets are good, Beal and Booker would be upgrades of course. But its not like they desperately need them.

**Pelicans**, like the Nuggets, are a team i wont spend too much time talking about. They are young and guys could take leaps this year (lonzo, Ingram), but they're on the list mainly because they could trade for Beal and Booker if they wanted too.

All of the **Celtics** centers are pretty trash and i'd say thats easily their biggest weakness. The issue is that the Wolves probably wouldn't entertain a trade for KAT without the Celtics adding Tatum. The only way i see them keeping Tatum is if the Memphis pick this year is the 7th pick (its top 6 protected). They can use that pick along with possibly brown, and whatever other assets necessary to grab KAT. Kemba, Tatum, KAT and Hayward if he returns to form would be nasty.

Side Notes:

Initially had Thunder on the KAT list but took them off because any trade for KAT requires SGA and thats pointless. You'd want to pair them not trade them for each other.

Didn't list the Cavs because i feel they don't have the assets to pull off a big trade.

Same with Dallas, they used their assets in the KP trade. They dont have any 1st round picks to trade until 2025

If these 3 players did request a trade i think the 3 teams that should push the hardest for each player would be

Devin Booker - Knicks, Magic, Wolves

KAT - Celtics, Knicks, Spurs

Beal - i honestly don't know",nbadiscussion
1953,958,"Is Kevin Durant currently in a regression in three point ability, or is his lowered percentage this year just the statistics coming out funny? If he has regressed, what are the primary factors behind it?","Durant is currently averaging .359% from deep on 1.9 makes out of 5.2 attempts. This is his lowest percentage since the 2010-11 season, where he averaged 35% on 1.9 makes out of 5.3 attempts. The league average is currently at .354%, but for a player who averages 38% for his career and finished last season at .419%, it's an interesting dropoff, especially when he's still at 57% from on two point shot attempts and 88% from the free throw line. 

The reason I'm not sure if I'm simply reading the stats wrong is that there have been frequent poor games this year from deep where he finishes the night with something like 1-4, 1-5, that sort of line from deep. In one stretch this season from Jan 18th to Feb. 2nd, Durant puts up the following nights from 3: 2 for 7, 1 for 2, 1 for 4, 1 for 4, 1 for 8, 0 for 2. That's a really bad stretch and there are plenty of nights like those throughout the year. When watching though, I can't really say that his shot selection this season has been noticeably different from the last 6 or so seasons where I can remember what the shots he took looked like. So is this year really just a statistical anomaly, and is Durant's three point ability the same as it's been over the past few years? Or has he actually regressed, and if so, what is contributing to that? Is it the way he's being defended, am I not recognizing possible changes in his shot selection, what are the factors here?

1954,959,"FIBA Performances, Reviewed","Now that both the United States and Serbia are both eliminated from medal placements, anyone want to discuss how their recent losses in particular showed their teams weaknesses? 

The United States team had glaring weakness from the start with lack of cohesion in team construction along with superior talent pulling out, but the game against France was an exhibition of Team USA's flaws as a whole. Mediocre play from bigs forced the US to go small against Gobert which killed them on both ends of the floor, and the amount of players who prefer to rely on themselves to create their own shots in Tatum, Walker, Mitchell, Middleton and Brown along with simplistic sets made the offense stale and predictable.

Ironically this lead to some of the best team defense of the tournament with the United States having to rally on halfcourt defensive execution for much of their play which certainly showed today, and their sheer athleticism and ability to get ahead in transition were their biggest gifts. 

The defeat against France was a mixture of many things going perfectly wrong for team USA, with both their stars butting heads and their role players not playing into their roles when needed. Lopez and Harris are both players who can be plugged into modern offenses relatively smoothly but both struggled to find a rhythm, especially in the case of Lopez who is prone to being pigeonholed into being solely a spot up shooter. His ability to stretch the floor could've done wonders against Gobert, but he was frozen and Turner was in foul trouble. Still, with his track record of playing Gobert well he might've done a better job on defense on denying Gobert inside.

Admittedly I didn't have much of a reason to follow non U.S. teams so I'm not as read on teams like Serbia and Australia, but I guess that's the point of the post.",nbadiscussion

1957,962,Is midrange shooting undervalued?,"I think the analytics revolution has been a great thing for basketball and the NBA. I'm always for the use of data to find new advantages as well as crush long held beliefs in sports. But I think this revolution has led people to ignore context and undervalue midrange scoring. 

As the argument goes, why take a long two when you could take a couple steps back and get an extra point for only a marginal increase in difficulty? I think this is undoubtedly true in the long run over the course of a season. Teams that get inside and generate open 3s tend to be the better teams. No disagreement there. 

But this ignores how these kinds of shots are often generated. If you only took inside shots, defenses would adjust and your efficiency would go down. Same if you took all threes. But if you only take 3s and inside shots, you are limited in certain situations. 

Almost every close playoff series I've watched, will have moments that come down to tough shot making at the end of games. Or a game where a superstar goes off and makes a ton of tough contested midrange shots. You could possibly say that midrange shot making is almost a requirement to contend for titles. 

You look at some of lebrons most iconic games such as game 6 in Boston, and he wasn't just driving to the basket 30 times and jacking up threes. He was hitting a variety of midrange shots: fadeaways, turn arounds, runners, etc. It opened his game up and allowed him to get inside more easily, and it also conserved energy. 

Ideally, midrange shooting should make up your smallest portion of your shot chart. But if it's practically a necessity in certain situations, and it's a rare skill to be able to do so with decent efficiency, isn't it actually quite valuable?   ",nbadiscussion

1959,964,Lakers should Learn from the Raptors,"The raptors traded for kawhi as a 60 win team. And they did not trade the supporting cast to do it. ""Replicating their model"" would mean the lakers build a very good team through development, drafting, and a collection of minor trades... *and then* adding super versatile pieces(also known as superstars) to a proven cast. The notion that the lakers should trade assets whose value haven't peaked for a single player who they don't have the cast to support when they can get him as a free agent and keep the cast neccesary for contention is both naive and shows a gross misunderstanding of how any of the league's recent successes have been built.

1961,966,[Serious] Which Michael Jordan 3-Peat is regarded as more impressive?,"Michael Jordan is widely regarded as the greatest player in basketball history, he won 5 MVP’s, 10 scoring titles, and even made the all-defence team 9 times. However its not just his individual accolades that stand out. Michael Jordan was a 6x championship player, winning finals MVP in all 6 of those occasions.  
  
He won in 1991, 1992 and 1993 before retiring and sitting out the 1994 season. He returned for the back end of the season in 1995 and lost in the second round to Orlando. Then in 1996, 1997 and 1998 he won three more championships.  
  
However I’m interested to know which three peat is regarded as more impressive.   
  
--------  
   
  
- During the first three peat, in the entire playoff runs, Michael Jordan averaged 34/7/7 on 50/39/84 (57% TS) shooting splits while also contributing 2.1 steals and 1.0 blocks per game.  

- In the finals his averages were 34/6/7 on 53/42/80 (59% TS) shooting splits while also contributing 1.9 steals and 0.7 blocks per game.
  
- He won championships against the following teams:   
  
----    1991) The 58 win Los Angeles Lakers lead by MVP runner up Magic Johnson and James Worthy  
----    1992) The 57 win Portland Trailblazers lead by MVP runner up Clyde Drexler and Terry Porter  
----    1993) The 62 win Phoenix Suns lead by MVP Charles Barkley and Kevin Johnson

- During the second three peat, in the entire playoff runs, Michael Jordan averaged 31/6/4 on 46/30/82 (54% TS) shooting splits while also contributing 1.6 steals and 0.6 blocks per game.  

- In the finals his averages were 31/5/4 on 44/32/81 (53% TS) shooting splits while also contributing 1.6 steals and 0.6 blocks per game.  
  
- He won championships against the following teams:   
  
----    1996) The 64 win Seattle Supersonics lead by Shaun Kemp and Gary Payton  
----    1997) The 64 win Utah Jazz lead by MVP Karl Malone and John Stockton  
----   1998) The 62 win Utah Jazz lead by Karl Malone and John Stockton  
  
    
-----  
  
Another thing to consider is Michael Jordans age. He was 32,33 and 34 years old in the second three peat and 27,28 and 29 in the first three peat.   
  
So which do you guys think is the more impressive three peat? The first three peat really cemented him as an absolute legend in sports history and he put up insane numbers. However the second three peat was against more difficult opposition in Jordans final years.",nbadiscussion
1962,967,Dave Joerger and Kings' rotations,"Dave Joerger, head coach of the Kings is implementing some unorthodox rotation decisions. I think those are a huge part of the unexpected Kings success this season.

Bogi in the second unit is a brave move by Joerger. The best player he had last season who's better than Shump right now is coming off the bench. The result is limiting Bjelica-Bogi minutes together to protect the defensive integrity, limiting Fox-Bogi minutes to give Fox full reign to set the tone, and giving a bona fide leader/scoring option to the second unit to have one of the deadliest benches on the league. It seems natural now, but after Bogi's injury was healed, especially after games Bogdan was on fire, this decision to give him a Ginobili role was criticized often.

Another brave move is keeping the rotations balanced and giving often <30mins to everyone including Buddy and Fox. This keeps fresh legs on the court at all times, the team plays at full speed 48 minutes. The results are obvious, everyone they play is spent at the end. This is the main reason a young team like the Kings wins the 4th quarters so consistently and lead the league in 4th quarter scoring despite often making inexperienced mistakes in the crunch time. Kings run hard but are still fresh for the whole game.

The third brave decision which is still heavily criticized is how he handles mistakes. This is a mental thing mostly, has a lot to do with development. He doesn't do ""punishment subs"" everyone expects him to do, benching young players when they're having a bad night. Even back to back boneheaded blunders doesn't get anyone benched and he doesn't panic-sub his starters even if the bench unit is getting destroyed in the 4th. He still manages to keep rotations flexible without changing the gameplan. Bjelica still starts, but Bagley gets more minutes than him when he's having a better game. This makes players more focused on rewards for playing good than punishments for playing bad. It is a healthy but still competitive environment to blossom for young players. Immediate results are creating solid rotation players from JJ who has been a disappointment before this year and Giles who started horribly this season, even Ben Mclemore gave positive contributions when he was called. Long term results I think will even be better as these players keep learning and developing in his system.

Overall I think Joerger is a rotation genius. None of these are obvious or common strategies, but he implemented them quickly, surely and got everyone to buy into the system.

1968,973,Is Kyrie a top15 player? Top20?,"This whole mess after his -29 76ers game got me thinking about him as a basketball player.

Obviously he's not a great leader, based on what he's been saying for a while now I think it's safe to say he's pretty dumb as well, although it seems he regards himself some kind of a genius or a big figure. How LeBron managed to hide this fact completely is maybe one of his bigger accomplishments lol. He's clearly not a leader but I'm getting sidetracked.

How good is Kyrie really? His finishing is elite (or is it?), he's shooting 39% from 3PT on 5.4 FGA (career), is a solid fascilitator. His offensive skillset is complete with a great midrange game as well. We all know how good his handle is, one of the best in the history of basketball, maybe even the best; talent-wise he's great. However, maybe we're overestimating his value as a player because of this? 

He's definitely not top10, at least imo. Guys that are better than him beyond reasonable doubt (in no particular order):

Giannis, LeBron, Kawhi, KD, Curry, AD, PG, Embiid, Harden - all self-explanatory really, that's 9.

Luka Doncic - he's already an elite playmaker, averaraging a near-triple double, with a whole array of offensive skills and size to help him on the defensive end as well. His 3PT% is low (\~32%) mostly because of the difficulty of shots he attempts from there. He turns the ball over a fair bit 9A/4.4TO to Kyrie 7A/2.2 but he controls the offense similarly to LeBron, whose turnovers are at 3.7. For his usage on the offensive end he still takes care of the ball very well and is way superior a playmaker to Kyrie, that much is obvious. He carries one of the best offenses in the history of the league. 

He's finishing way better than Kyrie - an insane 61% on 9.4 FGA inside 10ft vs 52.7% on 7.9 FGA 

[https://stats.nba.com/players/shots-general/?Season=2019-20&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&PlayerPosition=G&GeneralRange=Less%20Than%2010%20ft&sort=FG2A&dir=1](https://stats.nba.com/players/shots-general/?Season=2019-20&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&PlayerPosition=G&GeneralRange=Less%20Than%2010%20ft&sort=FG2A&dir=1)

Going over this and last season's stats leads me to believe I overvalued Kyrie as a finisher. He's definitely flashy and extremely skillful, but not super efficient, or at least he doesn't stand out. Yes he is undersized compared to some, but DeRozan, Harden, Rose or even Russ, Ja and Luka (already) are better this season, some of them significantly.

Defensively I still regard Kyrie as an average defensive player. He's improved under Stevens, maybe he's a very small plus on that end. His defensive rating is way up this season to 113 but it will probably decrease, small sample size. He may be better than Luka but I still think Doncic is a better player already, although only 20.

So that's the top 10 for me.

Jokić had a slow start, but has been improving greatly. He was a top10 player last season, with KD and Curry out he's a top10 this season. I think his value to a team is bigger than Kyrie, his impact on the Nuggets is huge. I also take Lillard over Kyrie, although it's hella close. He can lead a team, and so far Kyrie proved he can be a great sidekick, but no more than that. 12.

After that it's very close. Is Kyrie better than Gobert, Siakam, Butler, KAT, underappreciated Klay? I'm not much of a stathead and it'd take a lot of effort and digging to back that up or not. They are for sure better on the defensive end which makes it tough to compare as there is no metric, no matter how advanced, that takes everything into equation. I'm sure I missed someone but well.

I think he's better than the likes of Kemba, Russ, Simmons, Oladipo (this Pacers-Cavs series though) but I'm not sure I'm comfortable saying Kyrie is a top15 player even though he was All-NBA 2nd team last year. Are you?",nbadiscussion

These were again, subjective, and I used a combination of peak and longevity, my personal eye test and bias, along with their playoff defense/production.

&#x200B;

Going over these, a few things stuck out.  Jason Kidd, Kevin Garnett, and Tim Duncan all had incredible longevity on the defensive end of the floor.  While obviously their athleticism waned, they maintained excellent production on that end of the floor.  These 3 were far and away the best at their positions.  I also noticed that the voting ""rules"" are quite lax.  3 times  in the 20 year period there was a tie, and instead of having any tiebreaking system or simply putting one on first and one on second team, they simply put 6 players on the team and 5 on the second team which I find odd.  Additionally, there is a lot of leniency in terms of position, both between G/F and F/C.  In terms of individuals whose metrics varied immensely from the voting, Andrew Bogut was one of the best centers ever by PIPM but only made a few teams, and Kobe Bryant received quite a few selections despite being a negative player for most of his career by that metric.

&#x200B;

In terms of correlation, for this sample: Guards had the lowest, with the voting matching the metrics 28% of the time.  I think this is due to a few factors, firstly, PIPM very much favors players on great defensive teams, which is much more dirrectly related to rim protection and the center, so PIPM might have Manu Ginobili as one of the best defensive guards ever because he played a lot with Duncan.  I also think it's harder to evaluate guard defense.  Many people just look at steals or man to man defense when things like rotations, staying in front, and sound positioning and rebounding might be better things to look at when evaluating.   Forwards had a 40% match and Centers matched the metric 46% of the time.  This was quite surprising to me.  I also think that the voters are looking at metrics more recently (which is good imo).  From 2015-2019 there was a 48% correlation between the players voted and the players at the top of the metric, while for 2000-2009 there was only a 33% correlation.  One last little fun fact.  I think it's amazing that the one year that John wall was rated as an excellent defender he was voted in.  He didn't have any other selections based on reputation after that, nor did he have any PIPM years over 2. Here are the teams

1970,975,Announced trade: Kelly Oubre Jr. and Austin Rivers to the Phoenix Suns; Trevor Ariza to the Washington Wizards.,"[Source](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25540285/washington-wizards-trading-trevor-ariza-phoenix-suns)

What are your thoughts?

I don't really care for it... Maybe?

The Suns need either guys that won't take long term cap space paired with picks or young players they can develop. I don't really see Kelly as being that because he's going to have to get paid this summer and that seems to me not the best use of Phoenix's cap space. Mainly because the less cap space you have, the more you have to be focused on actually winning and the talent doesn't seem to be there yet. You already paid Booker, a second big contract to a young dude might not be the best idea so soon. So in that perspective, might as well take some other dude as long as you get a pick, even if a very late first that turns into two second rounders if not converted or something. Is that really not something big teams, that have real late playoffs aspirations this year to hand out? I guess Austin is another ball handler for a team without any playable point guards.

However, Oubre might not be that expensive with the RFA control because maybe no team is willing to give that expensive of an offer sheet and the argument that the team will still have cap space in two years (even earlier if they find a way to move Anderson). And you can definitely question what type of talent they'd get with cap space this summer anyway. So maybe they simply won a guy that can be a part of a future core and if that's how you see it, i'd even say that they ""won"" the trade.

For the Wizards, i guess i'm not that big a fan of this because i believe this core needs to be blown up, or at least shaken up in a more significant way. They are expensive as shit and they hate each other. Ariza won't solve this and i'll be shocked if they have a playoff run that justifies the continuous financial bet in these guys. But if you still think they should keep the team than at least i see why it's a good move because they won't have to go even further into the tax for Kelly and Austin was being trash. But: A) you're betting Ariza actually shows up and improves your team and i'm not sure the Wizards are the best scenario for him to do so; And B) He's going to be out of there next year and you have the same capped out, self-hating team while being less deep. Maybe future moves are to come...

What do you all think? I'm sure there are many different perspectives about this and maybe i'm thinking too much about something simple or just overall looking at it wrong. I do see fans of both teams happy about this (we have a young piece with potential and a ball handler vs we have a useful rotation piece in big moments and both got rid of trash and saved future money)",nbadiscussion
1971,976,"[OC] Finding Bargains in 2019 Free Agency - Targeting ""x"" Superpost","A week ago I started a series about the 2019 Free Agency. I've written about all the position and looking for 5 kind of players:

**Under the radar Free Agents**: That's the middle class guys that I think might not have the market they should, offering an opportunity for a team like the Pacers there aren't a FA destination get a good contract or a team like the Lakers that can offer living in Los Angeles + minutes to play and attention to get him if he decides to bet on himself on a even smaller number.

**Investment**: That's a younger guy that might be available usually becuase of some tax or cap situation, that a team could take a chance on him with a longer contract paying off in the future.

**Minimum guys to fill out the roster**: Some teams with no cap space still need players to contend, and that's the goal here. Look out for this part in the Center market.

**Just give him another shot**: That's a let down player that could comeback in 2019-20, and teams should buy his stock while it's down.

**Not cheap, but might be worth it**: That doesn't fit this post all that well, but some players are just no-brainers, hard to get production and have the potential to outplay even a richer deal.

Another post I've made and it's really interesting for this discussion, was mocking the off-season in order to understand how much money will be available to each tier of players, to better predict the contracts:

&nbsp;

Looking for good deals in 2019 FA, be aware that I won't be talking about guys like Patrick Beverley (everyone's talking about him), Brook Lopez, Dewayne Dedmon, Danny Green, and Bojan Bogdanovic because every team is looking at them, and they're in a really high point of their evaluation, which means that they're probably going to come back to earth soon and you'll have overpaid for unsustainable play.

The profile here are under the radar, underrated guys, that might be available for the right price. It contributes if it's original team isn't looking to re-sign them, because that's minus one very important competitor with bird rights.

&nbsp;

#Targeting Point Guards:
---
#Under the radar Free Agents:

*Player name, age on day 1 next season, type of FA, team he lastly played for 

**Ricky Rubio, 29 years old, UFA, Utah Jazz**

It's not a good sign that every team that signed Rubio ended up desperately trying to trade him in order to upgrade the team's ceiling. But Rubio still has good age and he's a really smart player and good at D. Even with it's fit problems, if you can get a low end starter for close to the MLE and you in need in that position, that's worth it. A young team might look into him as well, because of his ability to make teammates better in the regular season.

*My prediction: 8-14 million*

*My prediction: 6-10 million*

**Tyus Jones, 23 years old, RFA, Minnesota Timberwolves**

Tyus just had a really bad year, and that will probably cost him a lot. The Wolves also never looked quite invested in him so the restricted in RFA might not mean that much. A young but already really smart PG, would fit well with a young team.

*My prediction: 5-8 million*

**Austin Rivers, 27 years old, UFA, Houston Rockets**

Rockets probably won't actually re-sign and he showed he can stayed in the court even at the highest level of basketball, an incredible sign for a team that has high aspirations, such as the Lakers, I would also like him on the Warriors. 

*My prediction: 5-8 million*

**Ish Smith, 31 years old, UFA, Detroit Pistons**

Ish runs the backup unit very well, and he made the team look better than Reggie Jackson did imo. He won't age well but on a 2 year contract I think he would be a pretty good back-up. He's more of a regular season guy though and would fit well for those teams fighting to get into the playoffs, he's worth it a Room-MLE.

*My prediction: 4-7 million*

**Nando de Colo, 32 years old, RFA CSKA Moswcow** - Raptors have his rights, thanks /u/cartkp 

After ruling the Euro League for the past 5 years, he's rumoured to be coming back to the NBA. The guy has an euroleague career 65 TS%, is a big enough defender where he'll be able to be hidden on a 2 or 3 because I don't think he can guard NBA 1s. The league just might have gotten it's new FT% leader, De Colo has shot 95% from the line recently. He's a great shooter and will fit well in the league, he's signifficantly better than Teodosic in that matter I believe.

*My prediction: 4-6 million*

**Elfryd Payton, 25 years old, UFA, New Orleans Pelicans**

This might be my favorite one. Payton played really well this year, but got some strange years that kept him . He shot 32% from 3, but he did shot at a bigger volume, and the team played really well with him on the court, while being long enough to give you good flexibility on D. He's not quite on the level where his 3 point shot will be guarded on the playoffs though and that's a worry, but it might be worth to bet on it developing since it appears to be trending that way.

*My prediction: minimum salary - 4 million*

&nbsp;

My favorite fits: Rubio - Suns, Jones - Suns, Rivers - Lakers, Ish Smith - Hornets, de Colo - Lakers, Payton - not sure.

#Just give him another shot

**Jeremy Lin, 31 years old, UFA, Toronto Raptors**

Look, I know he played badly with the Raptors, but with a summer of recovery from his injury, he might comeback to his form of before injury (which was a ruptured patellar tendon, that has a good prognosis of recovery), and you can probably get him as a 3rd string PG right now for the minimum, so it's a low risk, high reward move.

*My prediction: minimum salary*

#Minimum players: best fill-out roster options

**Brad Wanamaker, 30 years old, RFA, Boston Celtics**

He was an elite player in Europe and looked really well in limited minutes with the Celtics, I personally though he gave the C's better minutes than Rozier last year. The Celtics will need cap space and they might just let him go, and imo he could easily be a backup in this league, playing minutes in the playoffs. I would like on almost every team, but what about him with injury-prone, no cap-space Miami Heat?

**MCW, 28 years old, UFA, Orlando Magic**

Wow, he's already 28 years old?? Yeah, but I do think he really rejuvenated his career in the Magic, with great D and stability, and I really like wing sized PGs. I kind of would like to see him in the Shaun Livingston role in the Warriors.

Almost made it: Shabazz Napier, Shane Larkin

#The Investment

**Alex Caruso, 25 years old, RFA, LA Lakers**

The Lakers will need every cap space they can get and even in that case right now they're close to 32.0 million in most accounts, but these accounts don't consider the 550k extra in cap holds if they actually keep Caruso's cap hold instead of trading him. That would bring them to about 1.3 million dollars under the max to give it to a player in 4 years, what would mean close to 5.5 million in money a player would've to give away. That might just not happen if they sign a max player who wants every penny of it and teams should take advantage of  that. Caruso absolutely could have a career as a back-up in this league, he's big and more athletic than he might appear, his 3 point shot is a work in progress, but in a good way. 

#Not cheap, but might be worth it

**Tomas Satoransky 27 years old, RFA, Wizards**

The Wizards will have 95 million dollars on Beal, Wall, Mahinmi, Howard, Hachimura and Troy Brown, that plus re-signing Bobby Portis (who rejected a 12 mi/yr extension byw), Ariza and Bryant, the Wizards just might not have the space to re-sign Sato. A wing sized guard, with great spot-up shooting, cutting and being just a really smart player, Sato is perfect for a contender. I'd throw a front loaded 50 million/4 years contract on him, because I don't believe the Wizards are getting even close to the tax to keep such a team. He fits anywhere but I would love him on  Dallas or even Indiana.

*My prediction: 12-15 million*

#Comments:

Some people suggested George Hill on this one, but I think he'll get a fair contract, he looked good on the bucks and I think many win now teams will look at him if they strike out on Pat Beverley, giving more of a fair contract than a bargain. Unfortunately this post good a bit outdated once Collinson retired. I've uptaded the Caruso situation as well.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
#Targeting Shooting Guards
---
The shooting guard is the position with the lowest average WAR according to Kevin Pelton, the weakest position in the league by a fair amount. If you position yourselve to acquire solid value in this position with short money this means you did a good job, because you'll have more money spent in other positions in the NBA with less scarcity of talent, making your money worth it.

Hornets 

*Mavs*

Pistons

Warriors

*Indiana* (Dipo's coming back in January)

*Lakers*

Memphis

Minnesota

OKC


All these team definitely could use a new 2. Teams in italic will have significant cap space this summer. But if you dont, it's not a problem here, we're finding the right guys for each team.


&nbsp; 

#Under the radar Free Agents

*Player name, age on day 1 next season, type of FA, team he lastly played for*

**Rodney Hood, 27 years old, UFA, Portland Trail Blazers**

The Blazers reportedly know he's out of their league (they'll only have the taxpayer MLE) and pretty much found a replacement for him already, so that's one less contender for the player. He's been quite incosistent but it seems like he found himself in the playoffs. Has a bit of off the court worries but a smart management can deal with that, he has starting level talent, ok defense, and playmaking ability at 6'7"" at a great age and that's a pretty hard thing to get with less than 20 a year. He didn't play well in the regular season though, and that's something I'd alert you: He's a bet. But a lot of teams in this league need to start taking risks in order to be a contender. If you can get him at the MLE (9.2) for multiple years? That's a great bet.

My question for him is what's he looking for? Is it the next 4 years of a contract or a 1 or 2 years of contract in order to prove himself to get the pay day of his life? If it's the second one, he might be the right guy for the **Lakers**. They have plenty of minutes to go around and he'd take a big playmaking role, if he's willing to bet on himself and take a bit less. 

*My prediction: 8-15 million*

**Wesley Matthews, 33 years old, UFA, Indiana Pacers**

I really liked him on the Boston series, he has that set os skills that's essential for a wing, good size, good individual defense, great 3 point shooter, but he might be looking more for his last pay day right now, he'll be 33 next season and really only fits win now teams. But I think he might age well enough to give him a 3 year contract, or maybe a partially guaranteed 3rd year. I'm really not hearing anything about him, I think he went totally under the radar and that he'll get significantly less than I was expecting.

It's hard to put a fit for a guy that fits really anywhere (in terms of playstyle), but I'd really like him on the **Timberwolves**. If OKC could make some trades (like a Steven Adams salary dump) and get a taxpayer MLE they'd be my perfect fit.

*My prediction: 7-10 million*

**Reggie Bullock, 28 years old, UFA, LA Lakers**

Reggie has great size at 6'7"", plays ok defense and his shot is good. He shot 34.3% on the Lakers last year, but he's a career 39+% shooter, so it's pretty likely that he'll regress. Theoretically he fits well anywhere, but I don't quite trust his off ball defense and his basketball IQ that much. I think he'd fit well in **OKC**, with Adams, George and other long defenders to cover up his mistakes.

*My prediction: 4-6 million*

**Garrett Temple, 33 years old, UFA, Indiana Pacers**

Temple plays really good defense and I quite liked him on the Clippers. I think he went under the radar because nobody whatches the Grizzlies + He didn't play that much on the Clippers. But that's alright, with temple you know what you're getting, really good defense with an OK 3 point shot, the enought for some gravity in the playoffs (career 35.3% shooter). He's getting up there in age though, so I'd stick to a 2 year contract with him.

I think he'll be really cheap and considering the **Hornets** situation I think he's a good fit there. Lamb probably isn't coming back.

*My prediction: 4-6 million*

**Wayne Ellington, 31 years old, UFA, Indiana Pacers**

Detroit didn't quite miss Bullock. Ellington gives you 90% of what Bullock did, with better and more agressive off ball movement, but lesser size and defense. I really like the idea for the Warriors to go full offense and just dare team to outscore them. I think Ellington is also quite smart and would fit well in the Warriors, as he's probably looking to an opportunity to get more minutes so he can get that last contract. I'd say the **Warriors** are the perfect fit.

*My prediction: min-5 million*


&nbsp;

#Not cheap, but might be worth it

**Jeremy Lamb, 27 years old, UFA, Charlotte Hornets**

I'm just not seeing a lot of hype around Jeremy Lamb. He pretty much gives you what Hood does with better defense and actual consistency. He's also a great rebounder, and runs pick and roll really well. A (small) wing-sized playmaker with great age. 

The fit is the main reason why I think he's here. He'd fit really well with the Hornets, Pistons (they just need some playmaking), Memphis (they like to acquire these smart deals like Kyle Anderson), Portland, Washington, but none of these teams have cap space! He'd fit well with the Lakers, but I think they will look for either a max guy or cheaper players, Indiana on the long run doesn't makes sense and I don't love the fit in the Mavs (with him taking the ball off Porzingis and Doncic's hands. I just don't see it. The best fit for cap space teams I found was the Kings, but he's kind of too similar to Bogdanovic, and Buddy is the starting 2. I think there's some (like 5%) chance he drops to the MLE. And that would be crazy considering the talent he showed this season.

*My prediction: MLE-17 million.*

&nbsp;

#Minimum players: best fill-out roster options

**Iman Shumpert, 29 years old, UFA, Houston Rockets**

After a not good end of the season with the Rockets, there's a good chance Shumpert ends up traded like a salary and than getting waived, or that's at least what multiple teams are thinking will happen. Otherwise Shumpert is way down in the list of teams priorities in a free agency of 200 players. His market might have dried up if the Rockets can't find a trade possibility and that would be a good opportunity for a lot of teams that need to fill out their rosters. 

**Alex Abrines, 26 years old, UFA, OKC Thunder**

**Where's Alex Abrines??** We haven't received any information about him since he left OKC. He's still a young good shooter with size, and if you can get that at the minimum you've appropiately filled that roster spot. The last I heard [was a report he'd comeback to Barcelona](https://www.eurohoops.net/en/euroleague/892507/alex-abrines-reportedly-in-talks-for-barcelona-return/) but nothing after. I think he can make it in the NBA, I hope he comes back.

**Rodney McGruder, 28 years old, UFA, LA Clippers, but really Miami Heat**

He had a down season after a good 2017-18 season. The reason he's here actually isn't that I think he's a **great** use of a minimum. I think he's ok, but the roster spots in this league are getting really low for the quantity of talent out there. McGruder is a 3 year veteran so he still qualifies for a 2-way contract. In similar way to what the Rockets did with Danuel House, I'd take a seriously look at McGruder as a 2-way player, a really no risk ok reward if when the music stops he's out of chairs.


**BONUS: JR Smith, 34 years old, UFA, Cleveland Cavs**

I think JR still has 1 year in him, and there's a high chance he'll traded and waived or simply waived. A great 3&D in the really early buyout market.

Edit: Since the Original post JR has been linked to the Lakers, so I'll add another BONUS:

**BONUS: Kyle Korver, 38 years old, UFA, Utah Jazz**

The Grizzlies are probably buying him out at some point, and even though he had a really bad playoff series against the Rockets he can still shoot the hell of the ball and log in about 12-15 minutes for a team in the playoffs in some series. I might like him with the Warriors off ball movement. I'd like him on Minnesota as well.

&nbsp;

#Just give him another shot

**KCP, 26 years old, UFA, LA Lakers**

Buy low. KCP it's in the [top 15 players who underperformed relatively to 2017-18.
](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l6PWeds4w99_z1aQ5sxrwwjyTST_-esvRbQxAQHbsyE/edit#gid=599975154)

He's actually my no.1 guy here. He ended last season on the right note, a good focused season out of the holophotes might give you back that tenacious defender with an ok 3 point shot (that actually looks better than it is). He played himself into the taxpayer/room-MLE, and there's talks about the Lakers bringing him back with it, but I'd try to get him locked under a 4 year cheap contract really bad. If I could get him for close 4/40 million honestly I'd do it, but 4/32 would be an excellent investment. 


*My prediction: 4-8 million, but in a short contract most realistically*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
#Targeting Small Forwards

First I'd like to say that this's a really weak mid-tier and low-tier class for Small Forwards. It was really hard to find the right guys, and I don't even feel that strongly about some of them. 

Players I'd like to talk a bit about it:

**Trevor Ariza** is a good player, but considering he has a really strong name in terms being a long time veteran and a known name in a really week mid-tier small forward class, I think he'll get a good contract and considering what he did last year, might be even a slight overpay. That's why he didn't maek the list.

**Rudy Gay** is also a good possibility here, but the Spurs have his early bird rights (They could pay him up to 17.5 million) and could pretty much match any offer (they aren't close to the tax), so I don't see many reasons for him to leave there. 

&nbsp;

#Under the radar Free Agents

*Player name, age on day 1 next season, type of FA, team he lastly played for

**Justin Holiday, 30 years old, UFA, Memphis Grizzlies**

When you're looking for bargains you should players who for some reason had a worst than expected year, and look for the reason he might regress to the player he once was. [Justin Holiday was PIPM's no.1 negative change guy last year](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l6PWeds4w99_z1aQ5sxrwwjyTST_-esvRbQxAQHbsyE/edit#gid=599975154). He was just really bad at both the Bulls and a let down at the Grizzlies. If he fits right with your team go for it, he'd be good playing for the Rockets.

*My prediction: 5-8 million*

**James Ennis, 29 years old, UFA, Philadelphis 76ers**

Ennis shows how important is to have a guy that can play in the playoffs. If it was up to Korkmaz or McConnell the 76ers just wouldn't have taken the Raptors to 7. 3&D guy that could've even helped the Rockets if they didn't trade him. Ennis would be pretty good in a LeBron team, honestly I'd start him and bring Kuzma off the bench.

*My prediction: 4-6 million*


#Minimum players: best fill-out roster options

**Darius Miller, 29 years old, UFA, New Orleans Pelicans**

3 point and no D, Darius Miller is an ok guy to bring out of the bench, and you know what you're getting with him.  His minutes flutuated a lot last year due to injuries, but he was playable in the 2017-18 playoffs. Something to think about is that Miller was Anthony Davis teammate both in College and in New Orleans, but honestly I think he'd fit better with a team like the Nuggets and the Warriors.

**Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, 24 years old, UFA, Brooklyn Nets**

Nets aren't bringing him back, but he's still a young wing that can defend and it's a super versatile guy, played some small ball 5 in the playoffs and honestly wasn't killed there. That's a good bet any team could do.

I'd think on **Sefolosha**, being 35 years old, he took a big step back last season, and only had about 12 MPG with the Jazz, he might just be too washed out to be a trustable player particularly in the playoffs. **Stanley Johnson** was also an idea but the guy just seems a bit too far from not being an offensive net minus. 

&nbsp;

#Investment: 

**Danuel House, 26 years old, RFA, Houston Rockets**

The Rockets have House's non-bird rights, what means that they can pay him nothing more than the 120% minimum, what means they'd have to use their MLE to really keep him. If Butler's coming, they'd be so pressed next to the appron having to hire like 10 guys to fill out the roster, that they might not match a good salary.

They also might not match it they're still worried about paying the tax. They already have 117 million on 6 players, filling in with 7 minimum guys they'd be on about 129 million, so they're still very close to the tax (132 million). Offer him a long term contract on about 6-7 million and watch Fertitta counting the pennies.

*My prediction: 5-7 million*

#Just give him another chance: 

**Jabari Parker, 24 years old, UFA, Washington Wizards**

I thought that he played badly, but athletically he was alright. Parker can really score and restore his value to a similar level to Kyle Kuzma (who's 4 months young) in the right fit. I'd bet on giving him a long term contract if I'm the Kings, Knicks or the Clippers if I have no where else to spend at. I'd happily give him a 4 years 35 million with about 24 million in guaranteed money

*My prediction: 5-10 million*

#Comments:

I didn't like that post as much, there just isn't a lot of answers here, the mid-tier SF is a big weakness of the market.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#Targeting Power Forwards

---
The Power Forward is a position where in the playoffs wings that can play small ball 5 are really valuable, so it's a position of high demand, finding players that can be serviceable back-ups in the playoffs for close to the minimum is already a major victory.

2 interesting players I'd like to talk about are **Nikola Mirotic** and **Al Farouq Aminu**, They are good players that might not comeback to their original team but with the strong market of it's position I don't believe they will provide good contract because they still have far too many weakness exploitable in the playoffs to justify a starter level of contract. 

Another interesting player would be **Carmelo Anthony**. Like I said, having a serviceable back-up player for the minimum at the wing is a major win, and I won't pencil Melo as a sure thing as a good back-up 4, but I think he can still make a comeback to play 10-15 minutes on a good team.

#Under the radar Free Agents

*Player name, age on day 1 next season, type of FA, team he lastly played for

**DeMarre Carroll, 33 years old, UFA, Brooklyn Nets**

Carroll is a not so good 3, deteriorated D kind of player, who didn't play well in the last playoffs, but if I don't think it would kill you to give 10-15 minutes for him a game in the playoffs with his hustle and at least teams won't let him open in the corner. That's the kind of impact James Ennis gave to the 76ers and you can see the importance in that, Carroll even gives you a bit better size, experience and some veteran leadership. A team like Sacramento could give him a contract.

*My prediction: 5-9 million/year, maybe 12/2.*

**JaMychal Green, 29 years old, UFA, LA Clippers**

Green was always a favorite of mine, but this year he showed his full potential on the Clippers, particularly in the playoffs ~~with those 5 fouls in 1 quarter agaisnt the Warriors~~ as a small ball 5. Highly versatile, a 4/5 that can hit 3s, JaMychal Green has obvious fit in the modern NBA, and would fit well as a backup 5 in the playoffs with the Lakers.

*My prediction: 4-8 million/year*

**Mike Scott, 31 years old, UFA, Philadelphia**

Scott has had a similar path to Green and has a similar style of play, with similar fit. I'd call him a plan B to Green though.

*My prediction: 4-8 million/year*

**Taj Gibson 34 years old, UFA, Minnesota Timberwolves**

Taj is a bit washed up, but he could be really good as a back-up 4 and playing some small ball 5. He's still a beast at the boards, still plays great D, and still is a very efficient offensive player. He even shot some 3s this year, a skill that would be very interesting for him to expand as he ages.

*My prediction: 5-7 million/year, what about 18/3?*

**Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, 24 years old, UFA, Brooklyn Nets**

The Nets made him a unrestricted FA and that should interest other teams. I don't think RHJ will ever be a 3 point shooter, but he's a great defender, and could fit teams in a specific role as a D specialist, in similar way to Royce O'Neale. He had a great 3rd year, with a TS% of 55%, but than he regressed a lot on year (got less to the line, got to 46.4 TS%). If he can bounce back he's a solid rotation wing, so that's a good bet particularly because I think he'll go basically for free this offseason. 

*My prediction: min-5 million/year, signs a 1 year deal*

&nbsp;

My favorite fits: Carroll - Kings, Green - Lakers or Celtics, Scott - 76ers, Gibson - Hawks, RHJ - Suns

#Not cheap, but might be worth it

**Thaddeus Young, 31 years old, UFA, Indiana Pacers**

Let's start with my no.1 guy in the position: Thaddeus Young. The Pacers reportedly are planing on Playing sabonis at the 4 and won't resign him. I'm very curious to see a more aggresive team that would put Young more at the 5 and encourage him to shoot more, as he already matches agaisnt 5s in most matchups, and could use his post-up game against small ball lineups. When Oladipo was there, Young was lethal in the pick and roll this past season, and I wonder what would he do with a good pairing. Young definitely gives you starter production for a not that big of a price. I really woud like to see him on the Jazz, or even in the Mavs playing aside Porzingis.

*My prediction: 11-15 million/year, maybe 50/4 or 45/3*

#Minimum players: best fill-out roster options

**Jeff Green, 33 years old, UFA, Washington Wizards**

Jeff Green had good size and is still really athletic, he can shoot and is still an iron man, rarely missing games. He was a solid player last year (The advanced numbers confirm that, RPM of -0.83 which is about average for a SF) and is the kind of 3 and D wing that teams really need, I definetely believe he can log in playoff minutes without hurting it's team. Minnesotta could use him to sub for Dario Saric.

**Kenneth Faried, 29 years old, UFA, Houston Rockets**

Faried rejuvenated his career with the Rockets, showing versatility and that he still is that monster of an athlete. His rim-running + vertical  spacing already has some value, his 8/21 in 3 PT shooting don't really gives you a lot of indication, but he being confident enough to shoot it in game might. The advanced numbers showed him as a neutral player (-0.17 RPM, +0.37 PIPM), what's good for back-up. The team certainly would need some adjustments in terms of defense. He should probably re-sign with the Rockets though.

**Luol Deng, 34 years old, UFA, Minnesota Timberwolves**

Deng can't be overused, but he's still a really smart team defender, the ability to get some buckets and to shoot a little bit. He probably can play a feel minutes in the playoffs without killing you in the 4, and that's valuable.


#Investment

**Trey Lyles, 23 years old, RFA, Denver Nuggets**

Lyles played poorbly this last year, particularly on offense, and the Nuggets already will have Millsap + MPJr + Juancho in the 4, so it's a low chance they're re-signing him. Teams should look into Lyles as still a project, who just had a really bad year (particularly with his shooting, he's a career 33.1% 3P shooter, but shot 25.5% last year), who will probably regress this year, and has a lot of ball handling for a big. He could still be a very interesting player on offense and he's already good on D. A team like the Suns could take a chance on him.

Since I've written the original post he was extended the qualifying offer. That makes this situation a bit harder, although I'd probably say a 24 million over 3 years offer would make it unlikely, but I'm not sure anymore that's actually a bargain.

*My prediction: 5 million per year, maybe 15/3 years*

#Just give him another shot

**Markieff Morris, 30 years old, UFA, Indiana Pacers**

Markieff Morris never really looked healthy in OKC. But he looked the better Morris brother his hole career, and I think he's really worth another shot as a 4/small ball 5 for a contender, as a buy low candidate. He can shoot a bit and has wing size, these 2 things already have some value, if he reabilitates physically and mentally he could give you starter production basically for free.

*My prediction: signs for minimum.*

&nbsp;

**The post pretty much ends here.**

&nbsp;

#Bonus: Directly from Europe

**Derrick Williams, Bayern Munich**

Derrick Williams was ok in europe, I just really wanted to let you guys know he's planning a comeback to the NBA, but he doesn't really make it to any of the classes here because I don't think he'll really contribute if he comes back.

**Mindaugas Kuzminskas, 29 years old, UFA, Olimpia Milano**

Kuzmisnkas is a good fill-out roster for the minimum option, and he's also planing a comeback to the league. Good size, athleticism and an ok 3 point shot, I'd take a flyer on him for minimum. What's up Knicks fans!

#Comments:

The Nuggets extending Lyles the qualifying offer surprised me a lot. I still think they won't match an offer for him that puts them close to the tax, specially because they have the extensions of Murray and Beasley incoming and should constraint them over the next years. 

The Power Forward position actually has a good depth, that'd make me optismitic if I'm a team like the Suns, the Jazz or the Warriors and I am in need of one. Thaddeus Young just might be a big steal in this Free Agency.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
#Targeting Centers
---
The Center is a very rich position in terms of players, I have a list of 33 interesting players at the 5 (or players at the 4 that COULD be seen as a 5), excluding players like Gortat and Chandler that are a bit washed out.



Player | Player 2 | Player
------|--------|------
Vucevic | Horford | BroLo
Cousins | Valanciunas| DAJordan
Enes Kanter | WCStein | Young*
Vonleh | Dewayne Dedmon | Bobby Portis
Thomas Bryant | RoLo| Khem Birch
Ed Davis| Maxi Kleber | Taj
JaMychal Green | Faried | Zubac
Marjanovic | Kevon Looney | Holmes
Daniel Theis | Jordan Bell | KOQ
Muscala | McGee | Noah
Cheick Diallo| Salah Mejri| Karminsky

&nbsp;

Considering the conclusion of my last post mocking the 2019 Free Agency, the results of 2018 Free Agency (Hey Nerlens Noel) you'd expect there will be a lot of bargains out there. The Room and Tax MLE will be powerfull, and possibly the BAE (Bi-Annual Exception, at 3.6 million this year).

It might also be a lot of 1 year contracts, considering there are really no advantages in signing back-up centers to long salaries:

* Low trade value of back-up and even low tier starters at the 5, even if at good contracts (See Ivica Zubac)

* Flexibility going forward, possibility to get younger.

* No dead money risk from a injury or massive drop-off.

* There will always be a good center available at the next free agency

* You never know what's the next draft going to be, that roster spot and minutes might have better value next season on a Zach Collins kind of guy.

&nbsp;

**Players I'd like to talk a bit about it:**

I don't quite like **Julius Randle**. He was a 20/10 players last season, but in a real playoff team what does he do? He is a big defense liability, still doesn't quite space the floor. It hurts too much to put him out there, I think he'll be too targetted in a playoff series. Randle's contract might be around 15+ million if the Knicks really strike out at everything else. I wouldn't pay him the MLE in this circumstances. 

**Aaron Baynes:** Baynes might be bought out by the Suns either now or in February, keep an eye for him.

**An interesting contract**: Is the Nerles Noel special. There are a lot of centers that will probably get the minimum. The top tier of these guys like Robin Lopez and possibly Kanter will have some teams competting, and a 1 + 1 at the minimum will be the contract to look out for. That means an player option on year 2, pretty much to give this guy some guarantee on being in the league next year. 


&nbsp;

#Under the radar Free Agents

*Player name, age on day 1 next season, type of FA, team he lastly played for

**Ed Davis, 30 years old, UFA, Brooklyn Nets**

If you don't count the fake reserves like Harrell and Sabonis (they play starting minutes pretty much) Ed Davis was the best back-up center in last year's league. He's a good enough switch guy, rebounding machine, good defensive player, solid pick and roller. And it just doesn't seem the Market has turned that well for him. The Nets are reportedly going after DeAndre Jordan, so that's one less competitor. I'd love him on the 76ers.

*My prediction: 4-8 million*

**Nerlens Noel, 25 years old, UFA, OKC Thunder**

The Thunder are obviously too deep into the tax and they don't have bird rights to re-sign him even if he wasn't. Noel is a low tier-starter in this league IMO. He'd be absolutely great at any team just because of how well of a defender he's, but I'd really like him in the Celtics if they sign Kemba and end up without a starting Center. The Lakers would be good in terms of opportunity for him, or a team that miss out on a bigger center, like possibly the New Orleans Pelicans.
 
*My prediction: 4-6 million*

**Khem Birch, 27 years old, RFA, Orlando Magic**

This is more of a situational one, if the Magic actually re-sign Vucevic and T-Ross, they will be too close to the tax to re-sign him. Khem Birch was one of the best back-up centers in the league last year. If the Magic aren't willing to re-sign him, he could be in the room-MLE - taxpayer MLE level.

*My prediction: 4-8 million*

#Not Cheap might be worth it

Brook Lopez. But wait a minute, I think I have a better one: Not spending top dollars in the Center position. Honestly you can get production for so cheap that I rather just take the Warriors route.

**The Warriors route, 2015-19, Bogut/Zaza/Looney/Bell/Jones/Cousins**

Filling out your roster with 3 or 4 centers with them having different playstyles, so you can adequate it to your matchup.

Some suggestions: 

1. KOQ, Noel, JaMyChal Green

2. WCStein, Karmisnky, Bell

3. Davis, McGee, Theis, Noah

Just a thought, mix it up a slower great defensive center (Bogut), a switching guy (Looney/Bell) and a floor spacer (Cousins).

#Minimum players: best fill-out roster options

**Robin Lopez, 31 years old, UFA, Chicago Bulls**

He's 31 years old and 2 months. what's actually younger than I though he was. He's pretty much the definition of solid in the center position. Great block out guy, makes your team rebound better, good pick and roll, smart defender. And he's really stable, being pretty much a sure thing.

**Richaun Holmes, 26 years old, UFA, Phoenix Suns**

Holmes played really well this year, I love Ayton and his potential, but many times the Suns looked better with Holmes at the 5. He's still kind of young, last year he really simplified things: Stopped shooting 3s and just did the things he does best, rebounding, blocking shots, going strong in the pick and roll.

**Taj Gibson, 34 years old, UFA, Minnesota Timberwolves**

Honestly it's a bit more unrealistic for him to only get the minimum, I think the BAE or room MLE might be just as likely, but he would be such a great piece for the playoffs, he's still a great defender and rebounder, really smart and efficient guy that fits really well a team that actually wants to contend. When you're playing the finals, there's only about 2 or 3 bench guys that can actually play without killing you, if you get one of them for the minimum you're good. 

>But he will  surely get the room MLE or part of the tax from someone

He earned 70 million dollars over his career (so that considerable money) though and he's 10 year veteran, so his minimum is $2,561,463, making the BAE not so lucrative and he could get a 1+1 worth 5.25 million, what's close in terms of guarantee money even to a team that gives him the full tax MLE. And maybe for that difference he just decides to play for the minimum for a team that offers a better option. I'd actually really like him on the Warriors.

&nbsp;

#Investment

**Jordan Bell, 24 years old, RFA, GSWarriors**

The Warriors are reportedly really high on Damian Jones, so I don't expect them to bring Bell back on a long term contract, specially considering Green's salary in 2020 and that they've addded Smailagic who'll end up overlapping a bit with Bell.

Bell didn't play very well last year, but he had a great rookie season, a really smart player with some size issues, could be an useful piece on the playoffs more than in the regular season.

*My prediction: A 3 years BAE might be enough here (11.3 million - 3 years)

PS: **Why not Thomas Bryant**? Someone will probably think: The Wizards have to re-sign Ariza (at least they hope to), Jabari Parker, Bobby Portis (who they've traded for) and Satoransky (they don't have another PG on the books). They just might be in the tax when it's time for their last signing of these 5 players. And that could mean the player could easily walk. But I don't think they would simply give away Thomas Bryant for the BAE or something. If that was the case they would simply match it and them trade some of these players for value during the season. Ariza will probably be really tradeable close to the playoffs. I think it would've to be a 7+ million dollars offer per year to actually steal him from the Wizards. Bryant is 21 years old, but he's more of a back-up center right now, and I think a 24 million contract for him would be more of a fair offer than a bargain. Specially considering the down side of signing centers for multiple year that I've specified here.

#Just give him another shot

**Kenneth Faried, 29 years old, UFA, Houston Rockets**

Faried showed some range this past year, but he's really worth for bringing to the table offensive rebounding, switching ability and vertical spacing in the pick and roll. That's for a player that I honetly think will get the minimum or a 1+1 min. 

#Comments:

I really want to say here that Joakim Noah looked quite well on the Grizzlies and would also be a good pick-up as a minimum guy.

Some people had a problem with my Faried inclusion as a 5, but I'd stand by it that he could play the 5 with the right 4 besides him. A lot of people are excited about Noel what makes me think if I might not be undervaluing his market.",nbadiscussion

Out of the 4 conference playoff spots 3 of them are divisional spots. The remaining spot goes to the best record in that conference. Throughout the regular season you play in a best of 5 games series amongst teams in your own division. Whoever gets the home court during the 5th game of that series is the previous seasons series winner. You play the rest of the your conference 3 times a piece. The odd game being the winner of last seasons mini series. The remaining games are 2 a piece against the other conference alternating locations. So how it would break down.

3 game mini series x 10 conference team  = 30 games

1977,982,How do you measure a player's potential?,"It's a sincere question, because I have no idea how. What makes a player have a high-ceiling? Age? Performance before the NBA? Performance in the NBA? Years in the league? Physical traits and athleticism? Coaching staff? If more than one, which ones impact the most? 

You probably think Booker has a higher potential than Kuzma for example (as I do too). But why? Kuz is only 1 year older than Book, but he also is only in his second season and Devin is in his 4th already. Of course, Booker's perfomance and numbers so far are indeed more impressive and overall better; but, as I said, this is Kuzma's second season in the league and he has way less touches and shots than him while also playing in a team that's trying to win. When you compare their sophomore seasons only, their numbers actually are pretty damn similar. 

Devin Booker: 22/3/3, 53% TS, 15 PER, 2 WS and -0.2 VORP.

Kyle Kuzma: 19/6/2, 55% TS, 15 PER, 2.6 WS and 0.2 VORP.

But, as you may know, Booker was 20 in his second season while Kuzma is 23. So, is potential determined only by age? Because a player can have a late-peak or an early-peak. Booker is still only 22 years old. But how much will he actually improve? Is he already close to his peak? Or because he is younger he still has lots of room for improvement?

Anthony Davis is still 25. Jokic is 23. But how much can they actually get better? 

AD already had incredible statistical seasons before, and currently he is averaging 29/13/4. But because he still is 25, he still has a higher ceiling? And what is that, GOAT status? Jokic is leading the Nuggets to one of the best records in the West while also having a MVP-type season averaging 20/10/8. Shit, if being young means he still isn't in his peak, that man is going to become one of the best players of all time.

I think Tatum is more valuable and a better asset compared to Ingram, as most people do. But why is that the case? Tatum does have better advanced numbers, but Ingram has a better production. Brandon still is 21 and Tatum is 20. Do we count efficiency or production when determining a player's potential? 

After writing this post, I have even more questions than before. I really don't know how to measure how much a player can get better, what is his ceiling and what is the most probable outcome. What are your thoughts?",nbadiscussion
1978,983,Do You Enjoy Watching James Harden's Style Of Play?,"Do you guys enjoy watching James Harden play? The iso's, the stepbacks threes, straight line drives to the hoop and most of all the drawing of fouls. I see a lot of people out here in reddit seem to not like it so much. I personally find him fascinating to watch. He has mastered a few skills to such a high level he is nearly unstoppable. The other amazing thing is that his defenders know what his moves are but everything Harden does is based on reading the defense and then reacting accordingly. If he faints to drive left and the defender bites and backs off he will stepback or shoot. If they don't move and freeze he'll drive.

1979,984,"In your mind, what does James Harden have to accomplish to start being considered an all-time great?","A few of his accomplishments so far: MVP, 6th MOY, 1x NBA scoring leader (on his way to #2), 1x NBA assists leader, 5x all-nba (4 1st team), 6x all-star, and he's got a lot of years left. 

I know the knocks on his game; he's hard to watch because he hunts for whistles, he has come up short and under performed (relative to his regular season) in the playoffs, and he is usually a matador on defense. That being said, he's one of the most incredible offensive forces the NBA has EVER seen. This will be blasphemous to a lot of people, but does James Harden have a chance to surpass, say, Dwyane Wade all-time? I think he does.

Just take a look at this last 7 years, including this year: (excuse my formatting, I'm terrible with computers)

The biggest knock on him is he has underperformed in the playoffs because refs hold their whistles, but hasn't Steph Curry ""underperformed"" relative to his regular seasons, too? The difference is he has Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and now Kevin fucking Durant! I'm not a huge James Harden fan, but I have to admit I think he's underappreciated. 


So, if you don't already consider him an all-time great, what does he need to do in your mind to solidify himself as one?

DEFENSE: people talk about how life is so much easier today without handchecking. Perhaps LeBron does benefit. But if he was allowed to do the same on defense, he'd be a far more dominant player. The more physical game benefits the more physical player, and he can manhandle 99% of all wings ever. Allow him to control the ball handler's center of gravity, and it's almost impossible to beat him off the dribble. Also, the key to slowing LeBron has never been brute physicality, but tough help defense and crisp rotations. He would EAT in a league that didn't allow doubles or zones, especially considering he had no outside shot for years

1984,989,What do you guys think of this playoff idea or something similar for this season?,"https://www.instagram.com/spencerdinwiddie/?hl=en

I think this can be a good experiment with the unfortunate circumstances but can be a possible change to the postseason. To summarize DInwiddie seems to suggest the league should have all 30 teams compete in this playoff tournament like the NCAA or World cup in soccer. It looks like the best of 7 series was still be applicable in the normal rounds.


  For me, I think this  is worth a shot cause if the league starts it is possible it is in late June, July, or August. The tournament can speed things up for next year.

  I think fans will not like having all teams compete and if this tournament idea is pernament, fans will think playoffs will be lessened and it's prestige is nothing. For me though, for years we all hear how the 7th or 8th seeds are pointless and how teams who go for these seeds are worser off in the future than teams that suck and get picks. So for me if fans think it's pointless to have the 7th and 8th seed, why it is the difference if everyone competes then?

  If we do this NCAA style tourney, The Bucks and lakers face the two worst teams in their conference. Then you go to second seeds and they face the 14th seeds in their conferences. The first round is maybe sinlge elimination or best of three sine single elimination increases chances for a major upset. Then for next round it is basically the usual first round of the playoffs, I think you can go back to best of 7 or maybe just go best of 5. Then you know what goes next, but when I look at this format it doesn't change much the old playoff format other than allowing the whole leagie to compete.


  Does it make the playoffs less prestigious? You can say that, but like I said all I hear is fans hate on 7th to 8th seeds unless they are young adn talented teams. For one this new tournament, increases the prestige of making the semifinals, could potentiall stop the tanking issue in a way, and also this makes the road for the championsip even a bit more difficult. I don't think it makes upsets easier as well ause those bad bottom tier teams will have it rough to even make it to the second round.

  I understand the complaints and I think this is a one time thing for this year for now. I think all teams deserve a shot to play some games this season when they hopefully and should resume, cause theywere all affected and all plaers deserve a shot to play the sport they love. Still, NBA has wanted to change a bit and you look at the conference tourneys in basketball, WOrld CUp soccer, or even look at European soccer leagues, all those leagues don't even have a playoff anyway. So for me allwoing all teams to compete could help all teams with profit and even if a team is terrible like 22 wins, the experience in a playoff like atmosphere will always be great for a team and players as they go on. People will say players are judged off of playoff experience so i think it's fair that all can prove they are winners like a Trae Young who hasn't played yet and needs to prove that.

  Again what matters the most is the finals anyway and how you perform.",nbadiscussion
1985,990,Kenny Atkinson is a top 3 coach of the year candidate,"Other two contenders are Budenholzer and Mike Malone. If neither of those teams secure the 1 seed in their respective conference, and Brooklyn gets the 6th seed, it will be a pretty tight contest.

The Bucks and Nuggets are stacked with talent. Both have a clear cut MVP contender on their roster, and a supporting cast with former All Stars. They are executing much better than last season, especially the Nuggets are overachieving, but that may not last.

Brooklyn? No All star selections for any player on their roster. Their best player (Caris Levert) has been out since mid November. They are basically a team of underrated talent, and guys making the most of second opportunities that - combined with Brooklyn's great player development - are significantly overachieving. They've dealt with significant injuries to almost every wing / stretch 4 player on the team (Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, DeMarre Carroll, Treveon Graham, Jared Dudley) in addition to losing Allen Crabbe for more than a month, AND their 1st round pick early in the season to injury. Spencer Dinwiddie has also had a nagging thumb issue and so was playing with a wrap for a week or two.

In addition, their bench is performing well despite only turning over 1 key player (Dinwiddie) from last year. Despite this, they are tied for the 6th with a 23-23 record with wins against the Raptors, Celtics, Rockets, Sixers, Nuggets. Kenny Atkinson's zone defense schemes have been a problem for a lot of these teams, and a major reason they are able to pull off upsets. His game management have also taken a huge leap forward. The Nets only beat the Rockets tonight because they started fouling with about 30 seconds to go, used timeouts effectively to advance the ball, and got Spencer Dinwiddie to his spot 3 times where he executed magnificently. Time and again they seem to be counted out, and go on a run to comeback into a game. Of their 23 losses, only 8 have been by 10+ points, and 6 have gone to OT or been decided on the final possession.

If they somehow pull off the 5th seed, I think he's guaranteed to win. What do you guys think? Is there a precedent for a team's coach in a similar situation winning COTY?

1986,991,Your Dream Team 2000 to 2019,"I was watching the [2011 Ultimate All Star Fantasy Draft from Inside the NBA ](https://youtu.be/BofOXnyQWZk) again and seeing their teams made me wonder about how the league has changed. Most of their early picks were players from the 90s and prior and it made me wonder how league has changed and who the new faces and leaders of the nba are. 

It’s been almost two decades since the 90’s and in that time we’ve seen a lot of players start, finish and reach the peak of their careers. 

So my question is simple in your opinion what would the best dream team from  2000-2019 look like?

A few stipulations: 

1) This isn’t the best players at each position, so thinking about how the players would play and what kind of system you would play them in matters. 

2) This team or teams would be playing across an entire season and playoffs. So essentially if all of the teams we think of were in the same league which would be best

3) Feel free to give not only your starting 5 but also another 5 you would play in rotation in the spirit of the afore mentioned 10 round fantasy draft. 

4) Assume that the teams are playing under current nba rules.

By allowing a team to win 3-0 or 3-1 and see an early 1st round rest, you give those teams an incentive to play hard for the extra game off. Not only that but fans of the opposing team may find themselves more involved in the games, not knowing if their team can turn it into a best of 7 series without additional cheering and support from everyone in the stands. It seems like outside of lost ticket sales, the increased interest in certain 1st round matchups may outweigh the potential lost $.

1989,994,Why do some players create difficult game winning potential shots?,"Title may seem weird but let me clarify. There are obviously a lot of factors that make clutch shots difficult. You are under a lot of pressure, there is little time left to get in a good position and the defense may play very tight defense the moment you catch it. But I notice a lot of players, especially star players make it extremely difficult for themselves. They receive the ball with 10ish seconds, stand around the three point line and dribble out the clock until there are 3ish seconds left. At this point it is obvious to the defender that you are gonna do a stepback/ fade-away/pull-up jump shot that will be easy to contest. Why not call a reliable play or a simple pick and roll if there is time for it. Why revert to isolations if when playcalling is so effective these days?

1990,995,What is Jayson Tatum's Ceiling?,"Jayson Tatum has been one of the most discussed players in the NBA over the past few months due to his hot stretch in February. I thought it would be interesting to take a quick look at his career up to this point and then discuss his value now and going forward.

Tatum's rookie year was unique for a top draft pick because he joined a team that had played in the eastern conference finals the prior year and acquired Kyrie and Gordon Hayward in the offseason. Regardless, he carved out a starting spot on opening night, and cemented it when Hayward went down. Throughout most of his rookie year, he thrived in a limited role spotting up as Kyrie and Horford handled most of the offensive creation. He showcased a very efficient statistical profile shooting **.475/.434/.826 and .586 TS%**. However, when Kyrie was shut down near the end of the regular season, he was given a larger offensive role. He really impressed in the Playoffs. Without Kyrie and Hayward, He helped the Celtics come within one game of upsetting Lebron and reaching the Finals; averaging **18.5/4.4/2.7** with only a slight drop in his TS% (.578). In the aftermath, he was hyped as one of the biggest up and coming stars in the league. Expectations were sky high heading into his Sophomore year.

Tatum's second year was disappointing any way you slice it. His raw stats improved as he was given a bigger role, but his efficiency dropped across the board **(TS% went from .586 to .547)**. Additionally, it was clear that his shot profile was hurting him. In his rookie year, he wasn't given much freedom until Kyrie went down. His sophomore year he sabotaged himself by forcing isolation looks and settling for way too many long 2's. It's important to note that the team dynamic for the 2018-19 Celtics did him no favors. This Celtics team had awful chemistry due to Kyrie Irving's lack of leadership and not nearly enough touches to go around for all the depth they had.

This season, Tatum was finally in a position to take a much larger role due to the departures of Kyrie and Horford in the offseason. Initially, he struggled to make the adjustment and was very inconsistent. He would have games where he looked like a star but follow them up with games like his 1/18 night in November. throughout the first half of the season, he made incremental improvements as he got more comfortable. After he made the All-Star game (January 30th), he rapidly improved and became the clear number 1 option for the Celtics. In February he averaged **30.7/7.9/3.2 with .494/.481/.769** shooting splits on the way to being named eastern conference player of the month.

With all of that said, how good is Jayson Tatum right now, and how good might he be in his prime? I think the answer to both of those questions hinge on how you perceive his performance in February. Clearly his 3pt% will fall from the 48% he was at, but what about everything else? Personally, I believe that stretch of games was mostly due to the game slowing down for him enough for things to “click”. I'm sure he will continue to have the peaks and valleys that any high volume of 3pt shooter will, but his shot profile during that stretch seems sustainable. 

When discussing a player's ceiling, I think it is important to identify the player model and how they can generate value. Tatum has a pretty clear archetype as an all-around two way forward in the same vein of Paul George or Kawhi Leonard. He's an elite defender that had an argument for 2nd team all defense this year, and he scores at all 3 levels. In particular, he's shown to be elite at what I think is the most valuable skillset in the game: off dribble 3 pointers. This is the skill that sparked his huge improvement during this year. He has become lethal in the pick and roll because he can efficiently hit 3 pointers out if it. This skillset puts so much pressure on the defense, and he has shown the patience to read how the defense reacts and make the right play. 

At this point in his career, Tatum has become very well rounded as a player. However, there are a couple of things that will help determine whether he peaks at the level of a player like Paul George or reaches a higher level. The biggest question is his passing ability. He is pretty average right now. The game has slowed down for him considerably and he can make the correct read most of the time, but he rarely makes any advanced passes. This will be crucial because he has shown that he can be a high-volume pick and roll creator and efficiently create looks for himself. Improving his vision would add so much value to his offensive game and he could pretty easily average 5 or 6 assists. This would allow him to be a true primary creator; pushing him from a top 10 player at his peak to an MVP candidate. The second question is his size. Tatum is currently somewhere around 6'8"" 220. He's definitely a lot stronger than he was earlier in his career, and that has helped his ability to finish through contact inside. How much bigger and stronger can he get without sacrificing his fluidity and quickness? If he can fill out to something like 235 by his mid 20's, he could handle playing the 4 full time which would give him better matchups and allow his team to surround him with more skill and shooting. If Tatum manages both of these improvements, I think he will have a long peak as a true MVP candidate. His skill level is already so high that his peak should start a little earlier at like 25 rather than the standard 27-28. This could give him 6-7 years as a true superstar in contention for Titles and MVP's (assuming his supporting cast is good enough). I don't think he will reach the heights that Giannis or Luka will, but he should consistently be in the MVP conversation as a truly elite two way forward.

If I was starting a franchise from scratch, there would only be a few players I would take over him. Giannis and Luka are the clear 1 and 2 (I would take Luka due to age but Giannis is better now). After that, I would probably take Anthony Davis over Tatum. I believe Tatum will end up being more valuable, but there is more risk involved as there is a lot of projection involved with Tatum. Then I would probably take Tatum. Zion would be close, and probably has a higher ceiling; but he has such a small sample size in the NBA and I would be worried about injuries with him. Obviously, players like Lebron, Curry, KD, and Kawhi, etc… are better now, but they are all near the end of their peaks.

What do you guys think? Do you agree with me that Tatum's ceiling is a perennial MVP candidate? Do you think I'm crazy and overvaluing a small sample size? Somewhere in-between? Let me know. I'm very curious to see how this community views Tatum right now. I think this is an interesting point in his career where reasonable minds can differ on whether Tatum just had his coming out party, or if he just had a super hot stretch.

**TLDR:** What are your thoughts on Jason Tatum? How good is he now? How high is his ceiling? Where would you take him if you were starting a Franchise? In this post, I detail Tatum’s career to this point. I argued that his stretch in February was mostly sustainable (other than shooting 48% from 3). Lastly, I argued that his ceiling is a perennial MVP candidate likely in a tier just below Giannis and Luka.",nbadiscussion
